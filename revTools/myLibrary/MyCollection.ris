N2  - In this study, a new cell density model was developed and incorporated into the formulation of the mechano-electrochemical mixture theory to investigate the effects of deprivation of nutrition supply at boundary source, degeneration, and dynamic loading on the cell viability of intervertebral disc (IVD) using finite element methods. The deprivation of nutrition supply at boundary source was simulated by reduction in nutrition level at CEP and AF boundaries. Cases with 100%, 75%, 60%, 50% and 30% of normal nutrition level at both CEP and AF boundaries were modeled. Unconfined axial sinusoidal dynamic compressions with different combinations of amplitude (u=10%±2.5%, ±5%) and frequency (f=1, 10, 20 cycle/day) were applied. Degenerated IVD was modeled with altered material properties. Cell density decreased substantially with reduction of nutrition level at boundaries. Cell death was initiated primarily near the NP-AF interface on the mid-plane. Dynamic loading did not result in a change in the cell density in non-degenerated IVD, since glucose levels did not fall below the minimum value for cell survival; in degenerated IVDs, we found that increasing frequency and amplitude both resulted in higher cell density, because dynamic compression facilitates the diffusion of nutrients and thus increases the nutrition level around IVD cells. The novel computational model can be used to quantitatively predict both when and where cells start to die within the IVD under various kinds of nutritional and mechanical conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Human lumbar motion segment is composed of various components with distinct contributions to its gross mechanical response. By employing experimental and computational approaches, many studies have investigated the relative role of each component as well as effects of various factors such as boundary-initial conditions, load magnitude-combination-direction, load temporal regime, preload, posture, degeneration, failures and surgical interventions on load-sharing. This paper reviews and critically discusses the relevant findings of in vitro and finite element model studies on load-sharing in healthy, aged, degenerate and damaged human lumbar motion segments. Two systematic searches were performed in PubMed (October 2018 - March 2019) using three sets of concepts (“lumbar spine”, “load-sharing” and “motion segment components”) followed by a complementary generic search. The segment overall response as well as the relative role of its constituents are markedly influenced by alterations in resection sequence, boundary conditions, geometry, loading characteristics (rate, magnitude, combinations and preloads), disc hydration, bone quality, posture and time (creep and cyclic). Structural transection order affects both findings and conclusions not only in force-control protocols but also in displacement-control loading regimes. Disc degeneration, endplate fracture and surgical resections significantly alter load transmission in the lumbar spine. In summary, in vitro and finite element model studies have together substantially improved our understanding of functional biomechanics (load-sharing) of human lumbar spine in normal and perturbed conditions acting as invaluable complementary tools in clinical applications.

N2  - Study Design. Investigation of the effects of the impairment of different nutritional pathways on the intervertebral disc degeneration patterns in terms of spatial distributions of cell density, glycosaminoglycan content, and water content. Objective. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that impairment of different nutritional pathways would result in different degenerative patterns in human discs. Summary of Background Data. Impairment of nutritional pathways has been found to affect cell viability in the disc. However, details on how impairment of different nutritional pathways affects the disc degeneration patterns are unknown. Methods. A 3D finite element model was used for this study. This finite element method was based on the cell-activity coupled mechano-electrochemical theory for cartilaginous tissues. Impairment of the nutritional pathways was simulated by lowering the nutrition level at the disc boundaries. Effects of the impartment of cartilaginous endplate-nucleus pulposus (CEP-NP) pathway only (Case 1), annulus fibrosus (AF) pathway only (Case 2), and both pathways (Case 3) on disc degeneration patterns were studied. Results. The predicted critical levels of nutrition for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 were around 30%, 20%, and 50% of the reference values, respectively. Below this critical level, the disc degeneration would occur. Disc degeneration appeared mainly in the NP for Case 1, in the outer AF for Case 2, and in both the NP and inner to middle AF for Case 3. For Cases 1 and 3, the loss of water content was primarily located in the mid-axial plane, which is consistent with the horizontal gray band seen in some T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the disc geometry used in this study, it was predicted that there existed a high-intensity zone (for Case 3), as seen in some T2- weighted MRI images. Conclusion. Impairment of different nutrition pathways results in different degenerative patterns.

N2  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive way of measuring muscular oxygenation. We evaluated the relationship between NIRS signal [infrared muscle oxygen saturation (IR-SO(2 mus))] and the femoral venous oxygen saturation (Sfv(O2)) during cycling exercise. Six healthy subjects performed a 30-min steady-state exercise at 80% maximal oxygen uptake in normoxia and hypoxia (inspired O2 fraction = 0.105). IR-SO(2 mus) was recorded continuously throughout the tests with the NIRS probe located on the vastus lateralis. During exercise, blood samples were withdrawn every 5 min from radial artery and femoral vein catheters. In normoxia, IR-So(2 mus) initiated a transient nonsignificant decrease at 5 min, then returned to preexercise level, whereas Sfv(O2) showed a fast decrease, reaching 18% saturation at 10 min without further change. By contrast, in hypoxia, IR- SO(2 mus) and Sfv(O2) demonstrated a parallel decrease then stabilized at 10 min. We conclude that IR-So(2 mus) appears to parallel Sfv(O2) when both the arterial and venous oxygen contents decrease during steady-state exercise in hypoxia, whereas IR-SO(2 mus) does not follow Sfv(O2) change in normoxia.

N2  - Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a noninvasive technique that uses the differential absorption properties of hemoglobin to evaluate skeletal muscle oxygenation. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb light equally at 800 nm, whereas at 760 nm absorption is primarily from deoxygenated hemoglobin. Therefore, monitoring these two wavelengths provides an index of deoxygenation. To investigate whether venous oxygen saturation and absorption between 760 and 800 nm (760-800 nm absorption) are correlated, both were measured during forearm exercise. Significant correlations were observed in all subjects (r = 0.92 ± 0.07; P < 0.05). The contribution of skin flow to the changes in 760-800 nm absorption was investigated by simultaneous measurement of skin flow by laser flow Doppler and NIR recordings during hot water immersion. Changes in skin flow but not 760-800 nm absorption were noted. Intra-arterial infusions of nitroprusside and norepinephrine were performed to study the effect of alteration of muscle perfusion on 760-800 nm absorption. Limb flow was measured with venous plethysmography. Percent oxygenation increased with nitroprusside and decreased with norepinephrine. Finally, the contribution of myoglobin to the 760-800 nm absorption was assessed by using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At peak exercise, percent NIR deoxygenation during exercise was 80 ± 7%, but only one subject exhibited a small deoxygenated myoglobin signal. In conclusion, 760-800 nm absorption is 1) closely correlated with venous oxygen saturation, 2) minimally affected by skin blood flow, 3) altered by changes in limb perfusion, and 4) primarily derived from deoxygenated hemoglobin and not myoglobin.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to quantify muscle deoxygenation in human skeletal muscles using near infrared time-resolved spectroscopy (NIRTRS) and compare NIRTRS indicators and blood saturation. The forearm muscles of five healthy males (aged 27-32 yrs.) were monitored for changes in hemoglobin saturation (SO2) during 12 min of arterial occlusion and recovery. SO2 was determined by measuring the temporal profile of photon diffusion at 780 and 830 nm using NIRTRS, and was defined as SO2-TRS. Venous blood samples were also obtained for measurements of SvO2, and PvO2. Interstitial PO2(PintO2) was monitored by placing an O2 electrode directly into the muscle tissue. Upon the initiation of occlusion, all parameters fell progressively until reaching a plateau in the latter half of occlusion. It was observed at the end of occlusion that SO2-TRS (24.1 +/- 5.6%) agreed with SvO2 (26.2 +/- 6.4) and that PintO2 (14.7 +/- 1.0 Torr) agreed with PvO2 (17.3 +/- 2.2 Torr). The resting O2 store (oxygenated hemoglobin) and O2 consumption rate were 290 microM and 0.82 microM s-1, respectively, values which reasonably agree with the reported results. These results indicate that there was no O2 gradient between vessels and interstisium at the end of occlusion.

N2  - Study Design. A prospective cohort study evaluating the quantitative lumbar flexion-relaxation phenomenon (QLFRP), measured with surface electromyographic (SEMG) signals from the erector spinae during trunk flexion pre- and postrehabilitation, in patients with chronic disabling occupational lumbar disorders (CDOLD). ObjectiveS. To assess the responsiveness of the QLFRP in documenting change in functional performance during a functional restoration program for CDOLD patients. Summary of Background Data. A recent theoretical construct suggests that QLFRP is responsive to change in lumbar range of motion (ROM) during rehabilitation, with high sensitivity and specificity for abnormal QLFRP predicting ROM. Methods. A cohort of normal subjects was tested for QLFRP correlated to inclinometric lumbar ROM measures. The cutoff score was applied to a group of CDOLD patients entering a functional restoration program (N = 135), and to program completers (N = 104). Pain and functional self-report scores were compared with SEMG and ROM measures. Results. The CDOLD group averaged 23.7 months off work. Surgical treatment was provided prerehabilitation to 51% of patients, with 29% receiving lumbar fusions. From pre- to post-treatment, achievement of QLFRP rose from 31% to 74% of patients, while normal ROM rose from 8% to 63% of patients. Compared to the 16% of patients still demonstrating both abnormal QLFRP and ROM, the other groups showed significantly greater improvement in self-reported pain and function, with the best improvements occurring in patients showing normal ROM and QLFRP. The QLFRP showed high sensitivity, but only modest predictive validity and specificity for predicting ROM postrehabilitation. Improvement in sensitivity and predictive validity occur when surgical cases were excluded from the analysis. Conclusion. A majority of patients in an interdisciplinary functional restoration program failed to demonstrate either the QLFRP or normal ROM on admission to the program. A majority of program completers, however, achieved both normal ROM and QLFRP and another 30% demonstrated either normal QLFRP or normal ROM. Both QLFRP and ROM measures were responsive to relevant self-report scales. © 2009, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Study Design.: Systematic review. Objective.: To identify, describe, and evaluate common outcome measures in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Summary of Background DATA.: The treatment of CLBP has been associated with multiple clinical challenges. Further complicating this is the myriad of outcome scores used to assess treatment of CLBP. These scores have been used to examine different domains of patient satisfaction and quality of life in the literature. Critical assessment of the frequency, parity, and the quality of these outcomes are essential to improve our understanding of CLBP. Methods.: A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken for articles published from January 2001 through December 31, 2010. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify measures used to evaluate outcomes in six different domains in patients with CLBP. The titles and abstracts of the peer-reviewed literature of LBP were searched to determine which of these measures were most commonly reported in the literature and which have been validated in populations with CLBP. Results.: We identified 75 outcome measures cited to evaluate CLBP. Twenty-nine of these outcome measures were excluded because of only a single citation leaving 46 measures for the evaluation. The most commonly used functional outcomes were the Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Index, and range of motion. For pain, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Pain Disability Index, McGill Pain Questionnaire, and visual analog scale were most commonly cited. For psychosocial function, the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and Beck Depression Inventory were most commonly used. For generic quality of life, short form 36, Nottingham Health Profile, short form 12, and Sickness Impact Profile were the most common measures. For objective measures, the work status/return to work, complications or adverse events, and medications used were the most commonly cited. For preference-based measures, the Euro-Quol 5 dimensions and short form 6 dimensions were most commonly cited. The validity, reliability, responsiveness, universality, and potential proprietary requirements are summarized for each. Conclusion.: Outcome measures should be routinely assessed in patients with CLBP. The choice of appropriate outcome measure should be influenced by the study objectives and design, as well as properties of the particular measure within the context of CLBP. Clinical Recommendations.: Recommendation 1: When selecting the appropriate outcome measures for clinical or research purposes, consider domains that best measure what are most important to patients. Measures that are valid, reliable, and responsive to change should be considered first. Other considerations include the number of items required (especially in the context of multiple measures), whether the measure is validated in the relevant language, and the associated costs or fees. Strength: StrongRecommendation 2: Domains of greatest importance include pain, function, and quality of life. If cost utilization is a priority, then preference-based measures should be considered. For pain, we recommend the VAS and NRPS because of their ease of administration and responsiveness. For function, we recommend the ODI and RMDQ. The SF-36 and its shorter versions are most commonly used and should be considered if quality of life is important. If cost utility is important, consider the EQ-5D or SF-6D. Psychosocial tests are best used as screening tools prior to surgery because of their lack of responsiveness. Complications should always be assessed as a standard of clinical practice. Return to work and medication use are complicated outcome measures and not recommended unless the specific study question is focused on these domains. Consider staff and patient burden when prioritizing one's battery of measures. © 2011, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the available literature on structural and functional brain abnormalities in chronic low back pain (CLBP) using several brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Methods: PubMed and Web of Science were systematically screened for relevant literature using different combinations of keywords regarding structural and functional brain imaging techniques in patients with CLBP. Reference lists of included articles were hand-searched for additional literature. Eligible articles were assessed on risk of bias and reviewed by two independent researchers. Results: The search query returned 27 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality varied from poor to good. A total of 10 studies evaluated structural gray matter changes. There is conflicting evidence in global gray matter changes, with both increases and decreases shown in different studies. Gray matter changes were demonstrated in specific brain regions. Structural white matter changes were reported in five studies. There is conflicting evidence in total white matter volume due to both increases and unchanged white matter. Several regional differences were identified in which white matter changes were shown. Functional organization during rest was evaluated in 10 studies. CLBP patients showed increased activation in specific regions, together with a disrupted default mode network. A total of six studies evaluated brain activity in response to a nociceptive stimulus. Findings suggest that patients demonstrated increased activity in pain-related regions, and decreased activity in analgesic regions. Conclusions: Overall, there is moderate evidence for regional changes in gray and white matter, together with an altered functional connectivity during rest and increased activity in pain-related areas following painful stimulation, evidencing an upregulated pain matrix. More longitudinal research is needed to clarify the temporal relationship regarding pain and neuroplastic changes, and integration of different brain imaging techniques is warranted.

N2  - Background context Disc degeneration (DD) reportedly causes low back pain (LBP) and is often observed concomitantly with end plate signal change (ESC) and/or Schmorl node (SN) on magnetic resonance imaging. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the association between DD and LBP, considering ESC and/or SN presence, in a large population study. Study design/setting Cross-sectional population-based study in two regions of Japan. Patient sample Of 1,011 possible participants, data from 975 participants (324 men, 651 women; mean age, 66.4 years; range, 21-97 years) were included. Outcome measures Prevalence of DD, ESC, and SN alone and in combination in the lumbar region and the association of these prevalence levels with LBP. Methods Sagittal T2-weighted images were used to assess the intervertebral spaces between L1-L2 and L5-S1. Disc degeneration was classified using the Pfirrmann classification system (grades 4 and 5 indicated degeneration); ESC was defined as a diffuse high signal change along either area of the end plate, and SN was defined as a small well-defined herniation pit with a surrounding wall of hypointense signal. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for LBP in the presence of radiographic changes in the lumbar region and at each lumbar intervertebral level, compared with patients without radiographic change, after adjusting for age, body mass index, and sex. Results The prevalence of lumbar structural findings was as follows: DD alone, 30.4%; ESC alone, 0.8%; SN alone, 1.5%; DD and ESC, 26.6%; DD and SN, 12.3%; and DD, ESC, and SN, 19.1%. These lumbar structural findings were significantly associated with LBP in the lumbar region overall, as follows: DD, ESC, and SN, OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.2-3.9; L1-L2, OR 6.00, 95% CI 1.9-26.6; L4-L5, OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.4-4.9; and L5-S1, OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.1-2.3. The combination of DD and ESC was significantly associated with LBP as follows: L3-L4, OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.5-4.0; L4-L5, OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.2-2.8; and L5-S1, OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.1-2.3. Conclusions Our data suggest that DD alone is not associated with LBP. By contrast, the combination of DD and ESC was highly associated with LBP.

N2  - Objective: To analyze muscle activation patterns during various footplate perturbations, used as proprioceptive challenges in patients with low back pain (LBP) and in controls. Design: A prospective and controlled comparative study. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Twenty subjects with chronic LBP and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Interventions: The subjects underwent 5 sets of footplate perturbations in 3 directions with 16 perturbations for each set. Main Outcome Measures: Latency, frequency, and asymmetry of muscle activation of the erector spinae, rectus abdominus, anterior tibialis, and gastrocnemius muscles were measured bilaterally with surface electromyography. Results: In the toes-up movements, subjects with LBP were significantly less likely to activate their rectus abdominus muscles (P=.02), and they were more likely to exhibit asymmetric muscle activation in the smaller forward movements (odds ratio=4.1, P=.03). The latter result appears to be driven by asymmetric contraction of the erector spinae and rectus abdominus. Conclusions: Significantly more subjects with LBP than control subjects exhibited absent firing of trunk muscles during 2 of the 5 footplate perturbations. These results suggest an abnormality of the neuromuscular loop and may represent altered proprioception. © 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to compare the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the trunk muscles between normal subjects and chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients during standardized trunk movements. Thirty-three male subjects (18 normals, 15 suffering from non specific CLBP) aged between 35 and 45 yr participated. A biomechanical analysis involving the recording of EMG signals from 12 trunk muscles, the kinematics of trunk segments and the computation of L5/S1 moments was performed. The subjects performed flexion-extension and lateral bending (left and right) tasks (three complete cycles) with and without a 12 kg load. Between group comparisons were performed on the full cycle average pattern of all biomechanical variables for each task. The reliability of EMG variables was evaluated for 10 subjects (5 normals and 5 CLBP) who performed the tasks on three different days. The reliability of EMG amplitude values was generally excellent for agonist muscles but poor to moderate for antagonists. The EMG amplitude analysis revealed significant differences between groups for some muscles (left lumbar and thoracic erector spinae). The abnormal (asymmetric) EMG patterns detected among CLBP patients were not explained by postural asymmetries. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - The purpose of the study was twofold: (1) to evaluate the reliability of distance measures computed from a principal component analysis (PCA) of electromyographic (EMG) waveforms of trunk muscles recorded during standardized trunk movements and (2) to evaluate their sensitivity to the load lifted, the trunk range of motion (ROM) and to low back status. Thirty- three male subjects (18 normals, 15 suffering from non specific CLBP) aged between 35-45 years participated. The EMG signals from 12 trunk muscles and the kinematics of trunk segments were recorded during 12 tasks. The subjects performed flexion-extension and lateral bending (left and right) tasks (three complete cycles) with and without a 12 kg load and at different trunk ROM (maximal or at defined submaximal angles). Distance measures locating each subject relative to a reference PCA model were computed for each muscle and task. The reliability of these distance measures was evaluated for 10 subjects (five normals and five CLBP) who performed two tasks on three different days. The reliability of distance measures was acceptable for agonist muscles only. The distance measures were sensitive to the load lifted and to the trunk ROM for different muscles and tasks but poorly sensitive to low back status. Several reasons that could explain the low sensitivity of these measures to low back status are discussed and potential solutions are proposed. A procedure based on a reliability analysis is proposed to select the number of principal components to include in the reference PCA model. It is expected that the refinement of the method used in this study could provide an effective clinical tool to assess EMG waveforms of trunk muscles during dynamic tasks. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - Individuals who have low back pain (LBP) have significantly different motion characteristics than healthy individuals. However, the cause of these differences is unknown. Oxygen use of the erector spinae muscle was examined while simultaneously monitoring motion characteristics to determine whether oxygen use differed between healthy and LBP individuals. Thirty volunteers were classified as healthy, structural, or muscular-based LBP. A near-infrared spectrometer monitored oxygen use and blood volume in the lumbar region. Results showed significant differences in oxygen use but not blood volume between healthy and LBP subjects with muscular-based disorders. Inability of the muscular group to use oxygen in a manner similar to the healthy group indicates different processes at the tissue level, indicating that differences in oxygen use may provide insight into why motion patterns differ between healthy and LBP groups.

N2  - The present study was carried out to examine possible mechanisms of back muscle dysfunction by assessing a stabilising and a torque-producing back muscle, the multifidus (MF) and the iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis (ICLT), respectively, in order to identify whether back pain patients showed altered recruitment patterns during different types of exercise. In a group of healthy subjects (n=77) and patients with sub-acute (n=24) and chronic (51) low back pain, the normalised electromyographic (EMG) activity of the MF and the ICLT (as a percentage of maximal voluntary contraction) were analysed during coordination, stabilisation and strength exercises. The results showed that, in comparison with the healthy subjects, the chronic low back pain patients displayed significantly lower (P=0.013) EMG activity of the MF during the coordination exercises, indicating that, over the long term, back pain patients have a reduced capacity to voluntarily recruit the MF in order to obtain a neutral lordosis. In contrast, during the stabilisation exercises, no significant differences between patients and controls were found for the normalised EMG activity of the two muscles. These findings indicated that, during low-load exercises, no insufficiencies in back muscle recruitment were evident in either sub-acute or chronic back pain patients. During the strength exercises, the normalised activity of both back muscles was significantly lower in chronic low back pain patients (P=0.017 and 0.003 for the MF and ICLT, respectively) than in healthy controls. Pain, pain avoidance and deconditioning may have contributed to these lower levels of EMG activity during intensive back muscle contraction. The possible dysfunction of the MF during coordination exercises and the altered activity of both muscles during strength exercises may be of importance in symptom generation, recurrence or maintenance of low back pain.

N2  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine the myoelectric activity of the erector spinae muscles of the back in order to determine if the flexion relaxation phenomenon occurs in seated forward flexion or slumped postures. Background. The flexion relaxation phenomenon during standing forward flexion is well documented. However, flexion relaxation in seated forward flexion has not been studied. It is possible that flexion relaxation could be linked with low back pain that some individuals experience during seated work. Methods. Twenty-two healthy subjects (11 males, 11 females) participated in the study. Surface electromyography was used to measure the level of muscle activity at the thoracic and lumbar levels of the erector spinae muscles. An electromagnetic tracking device measured the three-dimensional movement of the lumbar spine. Five trials each of standing and seated forward flexion were performed. Results. A slumped sitting posture yielded flexion relaxation of the thoracic erector spinae muscles, whereas the lumbar erector spinae muscle group remained at relatively constant activation levels regardless of seated posture. Thoracic erector spinae silence occurred at a smaller angle of lumbar flexion during sitting than the flexion relaxation angle observed during standing flexion relaxation. Conclusions. Since the myoelectric activity of the lumbar erector spinae did not increase, it is likely that the passive tissues of the vertebral column were loaded to support the moment at L4/L5. Ligaments contain a large number of free nerve endings which act as pain receptors and therefore could be a potential source of low back pain during seated work. Relevance. Examination of flexion relaxation during seated postures may provide insight into the association between low back pain and seated work. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Study Design. A comparative study of trunk muscle recruitment patterns in healthy control subjects and patients with chronic low back pain was conducted. Objective. To assess trunk muscle recruitment in patients with low back pain. Summary of Background Data. Conflicting evidence has been reported on the level and pattern of trunk muscle recruitment in patients with low back pain. The disparities can be explained partly by methodologic differences. It was hypothesized that trunk muscle recruitment patterns may be altered in patients with low back pain to compensate for reduced spinal stability. Methods. For this study, 16 patients with low back pain and 16 matched control subjects performed slow trunk motions about the neutral posture and isometric ramp contractions while seated upright. Ratios of electromyographic amplitudes and estimated moment contributions of antagonist over agonist muscles and of segmentally inserting muscles over muscles inserting on the thorax and pelvis only were calculated. In addition, model simulations were performed to assess the effect of changes in muscle recruitment on spinal stability. Results. The ratios of antagonist over agonist, and of lumbar over thoracic erector spinae electromyographic amplitude and estimated moment contributions were greater in the patients than in the control subjects. The simulation model predicted that these changes would effectively increase spinal stability. Conclusions. Trunk muscle recruitment patterns in patients with low back pain are different from those in healthy control subjects. The differences are likely to be functional with respect to enhancement of spinal stability in the patients.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: A two-part investigation was conducted: 1) a prospective study of asymptomatic subjects quantitatively comparing trunk mobility to surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals from the erector spinae during trunk flexion; and 2) a prospective repeated-measures cohort study of patients with chronic disabled work-related spinal disorder tested for the flexion-relaxation (FR) phenomenon while measured simultaneously for lumbar spine inclinometric range of motion (ROM). OBJECTIVES: To describe a theoretical model for the potential use of FR unloaded in assessing patients with chronic low back pain patients before and after rehabilitation, and to establish a normative database (Part 1) for subsequent use in comparison to patients with chronic low back pain (Part 2). The second part of the study assessed the clinical utility of combined sEMG and ROM measurements for assessing the FR phenomenon as a test to assist potentially in planning rehabilitation programs, guiding patients' individual rehabilitation progress, and identifying early posttreatment outcome failures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The FR phenomenon has been recognized since 1951, and it can be reproducibly assessed in normal subjects with FR unloaded. It can be found intermittently in patients with chronic low back pain. Recent studies have moved toward deriving formulas to identify FR, but only a few have examined a potential relation between inclinometric lumbar motion measures and the sEMG signal. No previous studies have developed normative data potentially useful for objectively assessing nonoperative treatment progress, effort, or the validity of permanent impairment rating measures. METHODS: In Part 1, 12 asymptomatic subjects were evaluated in an intra- and interrater repeated-measures protocol to examine reliability of sEMG signal readings in FR, as well as ROM measures at FR and maximum voluntary flexion. The mean sEMG signal averaging right-left electrode recordings, as well as the gross, true, and sacral lumbar ROM measurements, were recorded as normative data. In Part 2, 54 patients with chronic disabled work-related spinal disorder referred as candidates for tertiary functional restoration rehabilitation participated in a standardized assessment protocol for sEMG and ROM measurement before rehabilitation. Those who completed the program were retested with the identical methodology after rehabilitation (n = 34) using the empirically derived cutoff scores for sEMG readings at FR and ROM from Part 1 and prior scientific literature. Pain disability self-reported scores were correlated with sEMG and ROM. Sensitivity and specificity of the sEMG for identifying abnormal motion were assessed. RESULTS: In Part 1, the ability of the experienced testers to measure ROM and sEMG reliably at FR was high (r >or= 0.92; P < 0.001). All asymptomatic subjects achieved FR at a tightly clustered range of mean sEMG signals from 1 to 2.3 microV. Most of the variation between motion at FR and maximum voluntary flexion occurred through the hip (sacral) motion component of the gross (or total) motion measured at T12. In Part 2, posttreatment reliability for ROM, sEMG, and the ability to detect the FR point was high (r >or= 0.82; P < 0.001). More than 30% of the 54 patients tested before treatment demonstrated ability to achieve FR, with FR usually associated with higher ROM than in the non-FR patients. After treatment, 94% of those who completed the program achieved FR, including all those who achieved FR before treatment. Flexion-relaxation was associated with major improvement in ROM and pain disability self-report. CONCLUSIONS: Flexion-relaxation measures a point at which true lumbar flexion ROM approaches its maximum in asymptomatic subjects. This also is the point at which lumbar extensor muscle contraction relaxes, allowing the lumbar spine to hang on its posterior ligaments. The gluteal and hamstring muscles then lower the flexed trunk even further by allowing the pelvis to rotate around the hips. This phenomenon was subsequently found in Part 2 to offer a potentially promising method for individualizing rehabilitation treatment, decreasing unnecessary utilization, identifying potential postrehabilitation treatment failures, and assessing permanent impairment rating validity. Moreover, this is the first study to demonstrate systematically that an absence of FR in patients with chronic low back pain can be corrected with treatment.

N2  - Study Design. Electromyographic and biomechanical methods were utilized to investigate correlations between indexes of localized muscle fatigue and changes in the kinematics and kinetics of motion during a cyclic lifting task. Summary of Background Data. Recent advances in time-frequency analysis procedures for electromyographicic signal processing provide a new way of studying localized muscle fatigue during dynamic contractions. These methods provide a means to investigate fatigue-related functional impairments in patients with low back pain. Objectives. To study the relationship between localized muscle fatigue and the biomechanics of lifting and lowering a weighted box. Fatigue-related changes in the electromyographicic signal of trunk and limb muscles were evaluated and compared to kinematic and kinetic measures in order to determine whether lifting strategy is modified with fatigue. Methods. A total of 14 healthy male subjects (26 ± 5 years) cyclically lifted and lowered a 13 kg box (12 lifts/min) for 4.5 minutes. A 5-second static maximum lifting task was included immediately before and after the cyclic lifting task to measure changes in lifting strength and static electromyographicic fatigue indexes. Electromyographic signals from 14 muscle sites (including paravertebral and limb muscles) were measured. Changes in the electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency, a fatigue index, were computed using time-frequency analysis methods. This index was compared with more standardized measures of fatigue, such as those based on electromyographicic median frequency acquired during a static trunk extension test, subjective fatigue measures, and maximal static lifting strength. Biomechanical measures were gathered using a motion analysis system to study kinematic and kinetic changes during the lifting task. Results. During the cyclic lifting task, the electromyographic Instantaneous Median Frequency significantly decreased over time in the paravertebral muscles, but not in the limb muscles. Paravertebral electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency changes were consistent with self-reports of fatigue as well as decreases in trunk extension strength. The magnitude of muscle-specific changes in electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency was not significantly correlated with electromyographicic median frequency changes from the static trunk extension task. The load of the box relative to the maximal static lifting strength significantly affected the electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency changes of paravertebral back muscles. Significant changes with fatigue during the task were found in the angular displacements at the knee, hip, trunk, and elbow. These biomechanical changes were associated with increased peak torque and forces at the L4-L5 vertebral segment. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate correlation between localized muscle fatigue and biomechanical adaptations that occur during a cyclic lifting task. This new technique may provide researchers and clinicians with a means to investigate fatigue-related effects of repetitive work tasks or assessment procedures that might be useful in improving education, lifting ergonomy, and back school programs. Although both the dynamic and static tasks resulted in spectral shifts in the electromyographicic data, the fact that these methods led to different muscle-specific findings indicates that they should not be considered as equivalent assessment procedures.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between pain-related fear, lumbar flexion, and dynamic EMG activity among persons with chronic musculoskeletal low back pain. It was hypothesized that pain-related fear would be significantly related to decreased lumbar flexion and specific patterns of EMG activity during flexion and extension. Study Design: Data was obtained from subjects who, on a single day, completed self-report measures of pain and pain-related fear, and were interviewed to determine demographic and pain information. Subjects then underwent a dynamic EMG evaluation for which they were asked to stand, then bend forward as far as possible, stay fully flexed, and return to standing. Lumbar EMG and angle of flexion were recorded during this time. A flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR) was computed by comparing maximal EMG while flexing to the average EMG in full flexion. Subjects: Seventy-six persons with chronic musculoskeletal low back pain. Results: Zero-order correlations indicated that pain-related fear was significantly related to reduced lumber flexion (r = -0.55), maximum EMG during flexion (r = -0.38) and extension (r = -0.51), and the FRR (r = -0.40). When controlling for pain and demographic factors, pain-related fear continued to be related to reduced lumbar flexion. Using a path-analytic model to examine whether angle of flexion mediated the relationship between fear and EMG activity, the models examining maximal EMG during flexion and extension supported the notion that pain-related fear influences these measures indirectly through its association with decreased range of motion. Conversely, pain-related fear was independently related to higher average EMG in full flexion, while angle of flexion was not significantly related. Pain-related fear was directly related to a smaller FRR, as well as indirectly through angle of flexion. Conclusions: Pain-related fear is significantly associated with reduced lumbar flexion, greater EMG in full flexion, and a smaller FRR. The relationship between pain-related fear and EMG during flexion and extension appears to be mediated by reduced lumbar flexion. These results suggest that pain-related fear is directly associated with musculoskeletal abnormalities observed among persons with chronic low back pain, as well as indirectly through limited lumbar flexion. These musculoskeletal abnormalities as well as limited movement may be involved in the development and maintenance of chronic low back pain. In addition, changes in musculoskeletal functioning and flexion associated with pain-related fear may warrant greater attention as part of treatment.

N2  - Background. Low back disorders are a prevalent problem in society today and may lead to chronic debilitating low back pain. Developing our understanding of temporal muscle and kinematic patterns during manual material handling tasks may provide insight for preventing the cascading series of events leading to chronic low back pain. Methods. Sixty-two low back pain patients and 61 asymptomatic participants performed a variety of lifting exertions that varied in lift origin horizontal and vertical distance, lift asymmetry, and weight. Electromyographic activity of 10 trunk muscles as well as trunk and pelvic kinematics was recorded during each exertion. Differences in muscle activation and kinematic parameters were compared between low back pain patients and asymptomatic participants as a function of experimental conditions. Findings. Both the left and right erector spinae activated significantly earlier and were on significantly longer in low back pain patients compared to asymptomatic participants. The horizontal and vertical location of the lift influenced the EMG and kinematic differences between the low back pain patients and asymptomatic participants. Interpretation. These finding indicate that low back pain patients would be exposed to increase muscle activity resulting in higher spine loads for a greater length of time compared to asymptomatic participants. The longer exposure time to increased spine load may lead to greater risk of future low back injury and cascading events leading to debilitating low back pain. The longer muscle activation time suggests that low back pain patients have changed their motor program from an open to a closed loop system. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Simultaneous measurement of intramuscular pressure (IMP), tissue oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and EMG fatigue parameters in the multifidus muscle during a fatigue-inducing sustained muscular contraction. The study investigated the following hypotheses: (1) Increases in IMP result in tissue hypoxia; (2) Tissue hypoxia is responsible for loss of function in the musculature. The nutrient supply to muscle during muscle contraction is still not fully understood. It is assumed that muscle contraction causes increased tissue pressure resulting in compromised perfusion and tissue hypoxia. This tissue hypoxia, in turn, leads to muscle fatigue and therefore to loss of function. To the authors' knowledge, no study has addressed IMP, pO2 and EMG fatigue parameters in the same muscle to gain a deeper sight into muscle perfusion during contraction. As back muscles need to have a constant muscular tension to maintain trunk stability during stance and locomotion, muscle fatigue due to prolonged contraction-induced hypoxia could be an explanation for low back pain. Sixteen healthy subjects performed an isometric muscular contraction exercise at 60% of maximum force until the point of localized muscular fatigue. During this exercise, the individual changes of IMP, pO2 and the median frequency (MF) of the surface EMG signal of the multifidus muscle were recorded simultaneously. In 12 subjects with a documented increase in intramuscular pressure, only five showed a decrease in tissue oxygen partial pressure, while this parameter remained unchanged in six other subjects and even increased in one. A fall in tissue pO2 was associated with a drop in MF in only five subjects, while there was no correlation between these parameters in the other 11 subjects. To summarize, an increase in IMP correlated with a decrease in pO2 and a drop in MF in only five out of 16 subjects. High intramuscular pressure values are not always associated with a hypoxia in muscle tissue. Tissue hypoxia is not automatically associated with a median frequency shift in the EMG signal's power spectrum. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

N2  - Background. It is hypothesized that injury or degeneration of osteoligamentous spinal structures would require compensation by trunk musculature and alterations in motor control to maintain spine stability. While, biomechanical modeling has supported this hypothesis, studies of muscle recruitment patterns in chronic low back pain patients both with and without significant osteoligamentous damage have been limited. This study utilized a non-randomized case-control design to investigate trunk muscle recruitment patterns around the neutral spine position between subgroups of patients with chronic mechanical low back pain and asymptomatic controls. Methods. Twenty subjects with chronic low back pain attributed to clinical lumbar instability were matched to 20 asymptomatic controls. In addition 12 patients with non-specific chronic low back pain were studied. Surface EMG from five trunk muscles was analyzed to determine activation levels and patterns of recruitment during a standing reach under two different loading conditions. Findings. The chronic low back pain group with symptoms attributed to clinical instability demonstrated significantly higher activation levels of the external oblique and rectus abdominus muscles and lower abdominal synergist ratios than the control group. No significant differences were found between patient subgroups. Interpretation. While these data demonstrate altered muscle recruitment patterns in patients with chronic low back pain, the changes are not consistent with Panjabi's theory suggesting that these alterations are driven by passive subsystem damage. However, the higher activation of global abdominal musculature and altered synergist patterns may represent a motor control pattern that has consequences for continued dysfunction and chronic pain. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The lumbar paraspinal muscles were examined by surface electromyography (EMG) in 22 patients with low back pain and 22 healthy volunteers. Surface electrodes were placed bilaterally on the lumbar multifidus and longissimus muscles at the level of the spinous process of the third lumbar vertebra. Kinesiologic EMG was recorded, in standing resting position, during the following trunk motions: trunk forward flexion and extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. No muscular activity was observed in the full trunk flexion position in the control group. In contrast, continuous muscle activity was observed in the low back pain group. On axial rotation, an intermuscular time lag was observed at the beginning of the motion in the control group. In the low back pain group, there was no such time lag. Paraspinal muscle activities restricted lumbar range of motion, and protect from injury for movement. This suggests their role as stabilizers.

N2  - Lumbar arteries are important because they are the main source of blood supply to the lumbar spine structures. However, these vessels and their flow characteristics have received little attention and their role in conditions such as low back pain remains unclear. The present study 1. describes the application of duplex ultrasonography in the assessment of lumbar artery blood flow and 2. evaluates the interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of lumbar artery Doppler velocimetry. A total of 13 healthy volunteers were evaluated by two different examiners successively on the same day and measurements repeated by the same examiners 1 week later. Peak systolic velocities of lumbar arteries were recorded at an optimal angle below 60°. Overall mean peak systolic velocity (±SD) for lumbar arteries was 0.158 ± 0.051 m/s, and mean Doppler angle (±SD) was 24.6 ± 14.5°. For interobserver variability, the coefficient of variation was 23.4% and SD of differences 0.037 m/s. Reliable results of lumbar artery Doppler velocimetry demonstrate its applicability in future clinical investigations in patients with low back disorders. © 2006 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN. A prospective, case-control design. OBJECTIVES. To develop a kinematic model that characterizes frequently observed movement patterns in patients with low back pain (LBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Understanding arthrokinematics of lumbar motion in those with LBP may provide further understanding of this condition. METHODS. Digital fluoroscopic video (DFV) was used to quantify the magnitude and rate of attainment of sagittal plane intersegmental angular and linear displacement from 20 individuals with LBP and 20 healthy control subjects during lumbar flexion and extension. Three fellowship-trained spine surgeons subsequently qualitatively analyzed the DFVs to determine normality of movement. Final classification was based on agreement between their symptom and motion status (11 with LBP and aberrant motion and 14 healthy controls without aberrant motion). Independent t tests, receiver operator characteristic curves, and accuracy statistics were calculated to determine the most parsimonious set of kinematic variables able to distinguish patients with LBP. RESULTS. Eight kinematic variables had a positive likelihood ratio ≥2.5 and entered the model. Six of the variables described a disruption in the rate of attainment of angular or linear displacement during midrange postures. When 4 or more of these variables were present, the positive likelihood ratio was 14.0 (confidence interval 3.2-78.5), resulting in accurately identifying 96% of participants. CONCLUSIONS. DFV was useful for discriminating between individuals with and without LBP based on kinematic parameters. Disruptions in how the motion occurred during midrange motions were more diagnostic for LBP than range of motion variables. Cross validation of the model is required. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN.: Statistical Classification Model for nonspecific chronic low back pain (NS-CLBP) patients and controls based on parameters of motor control. OBJECTIVE.: Develop a Statistical Classification Model to discriminate between 2 subgroups of NS-CLBP (Flexion Pattern [FP] and Active Extension Pattern [AEP]) and a control group using biomechanical variables quantifying parameters of motor control. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: It has been well documented that many CLBP patients have motor control impairments of their lumbar spine. O'Sullivan proposed a mechanism-based classification system for NS-CLBP with motor control impairments based on a comprehensive subjective and physical examination to establish the relationship between pain provocation and spinal motor control. For the FP and AEP s, 2 groups defined by O'Sullivan and under investigation is this study, the motor control impairment is considered to be the mechanism maintaining their CLBP. No previous studies have used a Statistical Model with measurements of motor control impairment to subclassify NS-CLBP patients. METHODS.: Thirty-three NS-CLBP patients (20 FP and 13 AEP) and 34 asymptomatic subjects had synchronized lumbosacral kinematics and trunk muscle activation recorded during commonly reported aggravating postures and movements. Biomechanical variables were quantified and a Statistical Classification Model was developed. RESULTS.: The Statistical Model used 5 kinematic and 2 electromyography variables. The model correctly classified 96.4% of cases. CONCLUSION.: Selected biomechanical variables were predictors for subgroup membership and were able to discriminate the 3 subgroups. This study adds further support toward the validation of the proposed classification system. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Context: Chronic low back pain (LBP) has been reported with a high incidence in elite rowers. It results in less effective training, long interruptions in training, and a drop in performance. Objective: The authors hypothesized that exercise-induced LBP in rowers is caused by a chronic functional compartment syndrome (CFCS) of the multifidus muscle. Design: Controlled clinical trial. Setting: The rowers were tested in their training camp. The control group was tested at a university hospital. Participants: 14 volunteer elite rowers complaining of LBP and 16 healthy volunteer amateur athletes. Main Outcome Measurements: Intramuscular pressure (IMP), tissue oxygenation pressure (pO2), and median frequency (MF) shift in the electromyographic power density spectrum during isometric fatiguing extension at 60% of maximum voluntary contraction. Results: At the beginning (controls 186.6 mm Hg vs rowers 60.2 mm Hg, P = .002) and the end (controls 224.1 mm HG vs rowers 77.1 mm Hg, P < .001) of the endurance exercise the median IMP was significantly higher in the healthy controls. Nearly identical resting pO2 was measured in both groups (controls 37.6 mm Hg vs rowers 37.3 mm Hg, P = .740). Rowers showed higher median MF shift (rowers -11.5 Hz vs controls -8.5 Hz, P = .079) during contraction. Conclusions: These observations cannot sufficiently be explained by the CFCS model and suggest that factors other than IMP have an additional effect on pain generation during exercise in elite rowers. © 2009 Human Kinetics, Inc.

N2  - Background: The role played by the thoracolumbar fascia in chronic low back pain (LBP) is poorly understood. The thoracolumbar fascia is composed of dense connective tissue layers separated by layers of loose connective tissue that normally allow the dense layers to glide past one another during trunk motion. The goal of this study was to quantify shear plane motion within the thoracolumbar fascia using ultrasound elasticity imaging in human subjects with and without chronic low back pain (LBP). Methods. We tested 121 human subjects, 50 without LBP and 71 with LBP of greater than 12 months duration. In each subject, an ultrasound cine-recording was acquired on the right and left sides of the back during passive trunk flexion using a motorized articulated table with the hinge point of the table at L4-5 and the ultrasound probe located longitudinally 2 cm lateral to the midline at the level of the L2-3 interspace. Tissue displacement within the thoracolumbar fascia was calculated using cross correlation techniques and shear strain was derived from this displacement data. Additional measures included standard range of motion and physical performance evaluations as well as ultrasound measurement of perimuscular connective tissue thickness and echogenicity. Results: Thoracolumbar fascia shear strain was reduced in the LBP group compared with the No-LBP group (56.4% 3.1% vs. 70.2% 3.6% respectively, p <.01). There was no evidence that this difference was sex-specific (group by sex interaction p =.09), although overall, males had significantly lower shear strain than females (p =.02). Significant correlations were found in male subjects between thoracolumbar fascia shear strain and the following variables: perimuscular connective tissue thickness (r = -0.45, p <.001), echogenicity (r = -0.28, p <.05), trunk flexion range of motion (r = 0.36, p <.01), trunk extension range of motion (r = 0.41, p <.01), repeated forward bend task duration (r = -0.54, p <.0001) and repeated sit-to-stand task duration (r = -0.45, p <.001). Conclusion: Thoracolumbar fascia shear strain was ∼20% lower in human subjects with chronic low back pain. This reduction of shear plane motion may be due to abnormal trunk movement patterns and/or intrinsic connective tissue pathology. There appears to be some sex-related differences in thoracolumbar fascia shear strain that may also play a role in altered connective tissue function. © 2011Langevin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - In this paper, we propose modeling the activity coordination network between lumbar muscles using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals and performing the network analysis to compare the lumbar muscle coordination patterns between patients with low back pain (LBP) and healthy control subjects. Ten healthy subjects and eleven LBP patients were asked to perform flexion-extension task, and the sEMG signals were recorded. Both the subject-level and the group-level PC fdr algorithms are applied to learn the sEMG coordination networks with the error-rate being controlled. The network features are further characterized in terms of network symmetry, global efficiency, clustering coefficient and graph modules. The results indicate that the networks representing the normal group are much closer to the order networks and clearly exhibit globally symmetric patterns between the left and right sEMG channels. While the coordination activities between sEMG channels for the patient group are more likely to cluster locally and the group network shows the loss of global symmetric patterns. As a complementary tool to the physical and anatomical analysis, the proposed network analysis approach allows the visualization of the muscle coordination activities and the extraction of more informative features from the sEMG data for low back pain studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVES:: Lumbar flexion-relaxation (FR) is a well-known phenomenon that can reliably be seen in normal subjects but not in most chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. The purpose of this study was to determine which surface electromyographic (SEMG) measures of FR best distinguish CLBP patients from pain-free control subjects. Standing SEMG and lumbar flexion range of motion (ROM) were also evaluated. METHODS:: A cohort of 218 CLBP patients, who were admitted to a functional restoration program, received a standardized SEMG and ROM assessment during standing trunk flexion and reextension. An asymptomatic control group of 30 nonpatients received an identical assessment. Both groups were compared on 8 separate SEMG and 3 flexion ROM measures. RESULTS:: A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine how well each measure distinguished between the CLBP patients and the pain-free control subjects. All SEMG measures of FR performed acceptably. Between 79% and 82% of patients, and 83% and 100% of controls were correctly classified. Standing SEMG performed less well. Gross flexion ROM was the best single classification measure tested, correctly classifying 88% of patients and 83% of controls. A series of discriminant analyses found that certain combinations of SEMG and ROM performed slightly better than gross ROM alone for correctly classifying the 2 subjects groups. DISCUSSION:: Because all SEMG measures of FR performed acceptably, the determination of which SEMG measure of FR is "best" is largely dependent on one's specific purpose. In addition, ROM measures were found to be important components of the FR assessment. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Observation-based assessments of movement are a standard component in clinical assessment of patients with non-specific low back pain. While aberrant motion patterns can be detected visually, clinicians are unable to assess underlying neuromuscular strategies during these tests. The purpose of this study was to compare coordination of the trunk and hip muscles during 2 commonly used assessments for lumbopelvic control in people with low back pain (LBP) and matched control subjects. Electromyography was recorded from hip and trunk muscles of 34 participants (17 with LBP) during performance of the Active Hip Abduction (AHAbd) and Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR) tests. Relative muscle timing was calculated using cross-correlation. Participants with LBP demonstrated a variable strategy, while control subjects used a consistent proximal to distal activation strategy during both frontal and sagittal plane movements. Findings from this study provide insight into underlying neuromuscular control during commonly used assessment tests for patients with LBP that may help to guide targeted intervention approaches. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The local dynamic stability of trunk movements, quantified using the maximum Lyapunov exponent (λmax), can provide important information on the neuromuscular control of spine stability during movement tasks. Although previous research has displayed the promise of this technique, all studies were completed with healthy participants. Therefore the goal of this study was to compare the dynamic stability of spine kinematics and trunk muscle activations, as well as antagonistic muscle co-contraction, between athletes with and without low back pain (LBP). Twenty interuniversity varsity athletes (10 LBP, 10 healthy controls) were recruited to participate in the study. Each participant completed a repetitive trunk flexion task at 15 cycles per minute, both symmetrically and asymmetrically, while trunk kinematics and muscular activity (EMG) were monitored. The local dynamic stability of low back EMG was significantly higher (lower λmax) in healthy individuals (p=0.002), whereas the dynamic stability of kinematics, the dynamic stability of full trunk system EMG, and the amount of antagonistic co-contraction were significantly higher when moving asymmetrically (p<0.05 for all variables). Although non-significant, kinematic and trunk system EMG stability also tended to be impaired in LBP participants, whereas they also tended to co-contract their antagonist muscles more. This study provides evidence that Lyapunov analyses of kinematic and muscle activation data can provide insight into the neuromuscular control of spine stability in back pain participants. Future research will repeat these protocols in patients with higher levels of pain, with hopes of developing a tool to assess impairment and treatment effectiveness in clinical and workplace settings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This study investigated change in the distribution of lumbar erector spinae muscle activity and pressure pain sensitivity across the low back in individuals with low back pain (LBP) and healthy controls. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from multiple locations over the lumbar erector spinae muscle with a 13 × 5 grid of electrodes from 19 people with chronic nonspecific LBP and 17 control subjects as they performed a repetitive lifting task. The EMG root mean square (RMS) was computed for each location of the grid to form a map of the EMG amplitude distribution. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were recorded before and after the lifting task over a similar area of the back. For the control subjects, the EMG RMS progressively increased more in the caudal region of the lumbar erector spinae during the repetitive task, resulting in a shift in the distribution of muscle activity. In contrast, the distribution of muscle activity remained unaltered in the LBP group despite an overall increase in EMG amplitude. PPT was lower in the LBP group after completion of the repetitive task compared to baseline (average across all locations: pre: 268.0 ± 165.9 kPa; post: 242.0 ± 166.7 kPa), whereas no change in PPT over time was observed for the control group (320.1 ± 162.1 kPa; post: 322.0 ± 179.5 kPa). The results demonstrate that LBP alters the normal adaptation of lumbar erector spinae muscle activity to exercise, which occurs in the presence of exercise-induced hyperalgesia. Reduced variability of muscle activity may have important implications for the provocation and recurrence of LBP due to repetitive tasks. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for the Study ofPain.

N2  - Patients with chronic low back pain exhibit characteristics such as clinical pain, psychological symptoms and neuromuscular adaptations. The purpose of this study was to determine the independent contribution of clinical pain, psychological factors and neuromuscular adaptations to disability in patients with chronic low back pain. Clinical pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs, anxiety, neuromuscular adaptations to chronic pain and neuromuscular responses to experimental pain were assessed in 52 patients with chronic low back pain. Lumbar muscle electromyographic activity was assessed during a flexion-extension task (flexion relaxation phenomenon) to assess both chronic neuromuscular adaptations and neuromuscular responses to experimental pain during the task. Multiple regressions showed that independent predictors of disability included neuromuscular adaptations to chronic pain (β=0.25, p=0.006, sr2=0.06), neuromuscular responses to experimental pain (β=-0.24, p=0.011, sr2=0.05), clinical pain intensity (β=0.28, p=0.002, sr2=0.08) and psychological factors (β=0.58, p<0.001, sr2=0.32). Together, these predictors accounted for 65% of variance in disability (R2=0.65 p<0.001). The current investigation revealed that neuromuscular adaptations are independent from clinical pain intensity and psychological factors, and contribute to inter-individual differences in patients' disability. This suggests that disability, in chronic low back pain patients, is determined by a combination of factors, including clinical pain, psychological factors and neuromuscular adaptations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The relevance of a phobia-based conceptualization of fear for individuals with chronic pain has been much debated in the literature. This study investigated whether patients with highly fearful chronic low back pain show distinct physiological reaction patterns compared with less fearful patients when anticipating aversive back pain-related movements. We used an idiosyncratic fear induction paradigm and collected 2 different measures of autonomic nervous system activation and muscle tension in the lower back. We identified 2 distinct psychophysiological response patterns. One pattern was characterized by a moderate increase in skin conductance, interbeat interval (IBI) increase, and muscle tension increase in the lower back. This response was interpreted as an attention reaction to a moderately stressful event. The other pattern, found in 58% of the participants, was characterized by a higher skin conductance response, IBI decrease, and muscle tension increase in the lower back. According to Bradley and Lang defense cascade model, this response is typical of a fear reaction. Participants showing the psychophysiological pattern typical of fear also had elevated scores on some self-report measures of components of the fear-avoidance model, relative to participants showing the reaction pattern characteristic of attention. This study is the first to provide psychophysiological evidence for the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain.

N2  - Introduction: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) and fear of movement (kinesiophobia) are associated with an overactivation of paravertebral muscles during forward bending. This impairs spine motor control and contributes to pain perpetuation. However, the abdominal muscles activation is engaged too in spine stabilization but its modulation with kinesiophobia remains unknown. Our study tested whether CLBP and kinesiophobia affected the activation pattern of abdominal muscles during trunk flexion/extension. Methods: Surface electromyographical recordings of the internal oblique/transversus abdominis (IO/TrA) and external oblique (EO) muscles were analyzed in 12 people with CLBP and 13 pain-free subjects during low-velocity forward bending back and forth from erected posture. Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia was also administrated. Results: IO/TrA activation, but not EO, was modulated across the phases of movement in both groups, i.e. maximal at onset of flexion and end of extension, and minimal at full flexion. In CLBP group only, IO/TrA activation was increased near to full trunk flexion and in correlation with kinesiophobia. Conclusions: The phase-dependence of IO/TrA activation during trunk flexion/extension in standing may have a role in spine motor control. The influence of kinesiophobia in CLBP should be further investigated as an important target in CLBP management.

N2  - Spine intersegmental motion parameters and the resultant regional patterns may be useful for biomechanical classification of low back pain (LBP) as well as assessing the appropriate intervention strategy. Because of its availability and reasonable cost, two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopy has great potential as a diagnostic and evaluative tool. However, the technique of quantifying intervertebral motion in the lumbar spine must be validated, and the sensitivity assessed. The purpose of this investigation was to (1) compare synchronous fluoroscopic and optoelectronic measures of intervertebral rotations during dynamic flexion-extension movements in vitro and (2) assess the effect of C-arm rotation to simulate off-axis patient alignment on intervertebral kinematics measures. Six cadaveric lumbar-sacrum specimens were dissected, and active marker optoelectronic sensors were rigidly attached to the bodies of L2-S1. Fluoroscopic sequences and optoelectronic kinematic data (0.15-mm linear, 0.17-0.20 deg rotational, accuracy) were obtained simultaneously. After images were obtained in a true sagittal plane, the image receptor was rotated in 5 deg increments (posterior oblique angulations) from 5 deg to 15 deg. Quantitative motion analysis (qma) software was used to determine the intersegmental rotations from the fluoroscopic images. The mean absolute rotation differences between optoelectronic values and dynamic fluoroscopic values were less than 0.5 deg for all the motion segments at each off-axis fluoroscopic rotation and were not significantly different (P > 0.05) for any of the off-axis rotations of the fluoroscope. Small misalignments of the lumbar spine relative to the fluoroscope did not introduce measurement variation in relative segmental rotations greater than that observed when the spine and fluoroscope were perpendicular to each other, suggesting that fluoroscopic measures of relative segmental rotation during flexion-extension are likely robust, even when patient alignment is not perfect.

N2  - Purpose: Dynamic trunk flexion–extension testing has been proven to objectively diagnose low back pain in persons under the age of 60 years but older persons have difficulty complying with standardized movement velocity. Methods: 190 patients and 71 matched healthy volunteers (18–90 years of age) performed modified testing by holding static positions at standing, half, and full trunk flexion. Results: Lumbar extensor muscle activity in isometric positions was significantly higher in patients with higher activity in the oldest (60–90 years) and the middle-aged (40–59 years) but not in the youngest (18–39 years) subgroups compared to normal. There were no differences in gross trunk range of motion, half flexion relaxation ratio, proprioception, muscle activity differences between positions, and fear-avoidance behavior. The diagnostic accuracy as expressed by the area under the curve was fair (0.74). Conclusions: Lumbar extensor muscle activity demonstrated moderate to good diagnostic value in old patients.

N2  - The aim was to investigate the effect of mechanical pain stimulation at the lower back on hemodynamic and oxygenation changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) assessed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and on the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) measured by capnography. 13 healthy subjects underwent three measurements (M) during pain stimulation using pressure pain threshold (PPT) at three locations, i.e., the processus spinosus at the level of L4 (M1) and the lumbar paravertebral muscles at the level of L1 on the left (M2) and the right (M3) side. Results showed that only in the M2 condition the pain stimulation elicited characteristic patterns consisting of (1) a fNIRS-derived decrease in oxy-and total hemoglobin concentration and tissue oxygen saturation, an increase in deoxy-hemoglobin concentration, (2) a decrease in the PetCO2 response and (3) a decrease in coherence between fNIRS parameters and PetCO2 responses in the respiratory frequency band (0.2-0.5 Hz). We discuss the comparison between M2 vs. M1 and M3, suggesting that the non-significant findings in the two latter measurements were most likely subject to effects of the different stimulated tissues, the stimulated locations and the stimulation order. We highlight that PetCO2 is a crucial parameter for proper interpretation of fNIRS data in experimental protocols involving pain stimulation. Together, our data suggest that the combined fNIRS-capnography approach has potential for further development as pain monitoring method, such as for evaluating clinical pain treatment. © 2014 Imperial College Press.

N2  - Objective To evaluate the rate of force development (RFD) and the rate of electromyography rise (RER) of global and local trunk muscles in women with and without low back pain. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Laboratory setting. Participants Twenty-eight women divided into low back pain (LBP, n = 14) and control groups (CG, n = 14) participated in this study. Main outcome measures Subjects performed isometric contractions of trunk using an isokinetic dynamometer, and simultaneously the electromyography (EMG) signals were collected for global (rectus abdominis and longissimus thoracic) and local (internal oblique and multifidus) muscles. All variables were calculated using Matlab software. Results Symptomatic subjects showed lower RFD during trunk extension and it was correlated to a reduced RER mainly in the trunk extensor musculature (p < 0.05). During trunk flexion, LBP exhibited a delayed time to reach peak RFD (p < 0.05) compared to CG. RER for global anterior muscle was higher than for local muscle (p < 0.05) and it was more persistent in asymptomatic women. CG also presented greater activation amplitude for both agonist and antagonist trunk muscles, mainly the global ones. Conclusion Symptomatic women showed lower RFD and it was correlated to a reduced capacity of rapid muscle activation mainly in the trunk extensor musculature.

N2  - Purpose/aim: Recently, a novel measure of cortical disinhibition was identified using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This measure, described as post-silent period electromyographic (EMG) bursting, may inform on the corticomotor control of movement in health and disease; however, it has not been investigated for muscles outside the hand or in musculoskeletal conditions. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of “EMG bursting” in individuals with and without low back pain (LBP). Materials and Methods: TMS was used to map the motor cortical representation of paraspinal muscles in 11 individuals with LBP and 11 pain-free controls. The latency, duration and magnitude of bursting, number of active burst sites, map volume and coordinates of the burst “hotspot” were compared between the groups. Results: In pain-free controls, the latency, duration and magnitude of bursts were similar to the hand; however, bursts occurred earlier and were of smaller magnitude in LBP. Bursting was widespread throughout the cortical representation in both groups; however, there was a trend towards smaller mean EMG burst and map volume in LBP. Conclusions: We confirm the presence of EMG bursting in back muscles and provide a description of the spatial profile of this mechanism. Our observations in LBP suggest that cortical disinhibition may be altered in this condition.

N2  - Changes in the recruitment pattern of trunk muscles may contribute to the development of recurrent or chronic symptoms in people with low back pain (LBP). However, the recruitment pattern of trunk muscles during lifting tasks associated with a high risk of LBP has not been clearly determined in recurrent LBP. The present study aimed to investigate potential differences in trunk muscles recruitment patterns between individuals with recurrent LBP and asymptomatic individuals during lifting. The subjects were 25 individuals with recurrent LBP and 20 asymptomatic individuals. Electromyography (EMG) was used to measure onset time, EMG amplitude, overall activity of abdominal muscles, and overall activity of back muscles during a lifting task. The onsets of the transversus abdominis/internal abdominal oblique and multifidus were delayed in the recurrent LBP group despite remission from symptoms. Additionally, the EMG amplitudes of the erector spinae, as well as the overall activity of abdominal muscles or back muscles, were greater in the recurrent LBP group. No differences in EMG amplitude of the external oblique, transversus abdominis/internal abdominal oblique, and multifidus were found between the groups. Our findings indicate the presence of an altered trunk muscle recruitment pattern in individuals with recurrent LBP during lifting.

N2  - There is limited information in the literature related to the lower back loading in patients with LBP, particularly those with non-chronic LBP. Toward addressing such a research gap, a case-control study was conducted to explore the differences in lower back mechanical loads between a group of females (n = 19) with non-chronic, non-specific LBP and a group of asymptomatic females (n = 19). The differences in lower back mechanical loads were determined when participants completed one symmetric lowering and lifting of a 4.5 kg load at their preferred cadence. The axial, shearing, and moment components of task demand at the time of peak moment component as well as measures of peak trunk kinematics were analyzed. Patient vs. asymptomatic group performed the task with smaller peak thoracic rotation and peak lumbar flexion. While no differences in the moment component of task demand on the lower back between the patients and controls were found, the shearing (40–50 age group) and axial components of task demand were, respectively, larger and smaller in patients vs. controls. Whether alterations in lower back loads in patients with non-chronic LBP are in response to pain or preceded the pain, the long-term exposure to abnormal lower back mechanics may adversely affect spinal structure and increase the likelihood of further injury or pain. Therefore, the underlying reason(s) as well as the potential consequence(s) of such altered lower back mechanics in patients with non-chronic LBP should to be further investigated.

N2  - Various studies have reported alterations of spinal kinematics in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) during gait. However, while recent findings stressed the importance of multi-segment analysis, most of prior gait studies modelled the lumbar spine as one segment, when it was not the entire trunk that was considered as a single segment. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive multi-segment research that could improve our understanding of CLBP pathomechanism and thus possibly contribute to better care for CLBP. This study aimed at characterizing the angle patterns at the lower lumbar (LLS), upper lumbar (ULS), lower thoracic (LTS) and upper thoracic (UTS) joints in the three anatomical planes and at comparing CLBP patients and asymptomatic subjects. Spinal kinematics of 11 CLBP patients and 11 controls was measured using a marker-based motion capture system and described according to a previously proposed multi-segment biomechanical model. Characteristic patterns were observed at the UTS, LTS and ULS joints in the transverse plane and at the UTS, ULS and LLS joints in the frontal plane. CLBP patients walked with smaller frontal-plane LLS range of motion than controls. The results also suggested that patients had more asymmetrical LTS motion in the transverse plane. In conclusion, this work extended prior literature by showing specific CLBP-related alterations in multi-segment spinal kinematics during gait. Further research is necessary to understand the factors influencing kinematics alterations and how treatment strategies might improve motor behaviour in CLBP patients.

N2  - Purpose: A multidimensional classification approach suggests that motor control impairment subgroups exist in non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). Differences in sitting lumbar posture have been identified between two such subgroups [flexion pattern (FP) and active extension pattern (AEP)] and healthy individuals; however, functional spinal movement has not been explored. This study will evaluate whether NSCLBP subgroups exhibit regional spinal kinematic differences, compared to healthy individuals, during functional tasks. Methods: Observational, cross-sectional study design. Spinal kinematics of 50 NSCLBP subjects (27 FP, 23 AEP) and 28 healthy individuals were investigated using 3D motion analysis (Vicon™) during functional tasks [reaching upwards, step down, step up, lifting, and replacing a box, stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, bending to retrieve (and returning from retrieving) a pen from the floor]. Mean sagittal angle for the total thoracic, total lumbar, upper thoracic, lower thoracic, upper lumbar, and lower lumbar regions between groups was compared. Results: Significant differences were observed in lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions between NSCLBP subgroups during most tasks. Significant differences were observed between the FP and healthy group in the lower thoracic region during stand-to-sit-to-stand tasks and bending (and returning from) to retrieve a pen from the floor. All significant results demonstrated the FP group to operate in comparatively greater flexion. Conclusions: The thoraco-lumbar spine discriminated between FP and AEP, and FP and healthy groups during functional tasks. FP individuals demonstrated more kyphotic thoraco-lumbar postures, which may be pain provocative. No significant differences were observed between AEP and healthy groups, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may occur in AEP.

N2  - Background: Low back pain (LBP) affects more than one third of the population at any given time, and chronic LBP is responsible for increased medical costs, functional limitations and decreased quality of life. A clear etiology is often difficult to identify, but aberrant posture and movement are considered contributing factors to chronic LBP that are addressed during physiotherapy intervention. Information about aberrant movement during functional activities in people with LBP can help inform more effective interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are differences in lumbar spine and lower extremity kinematics in people with and without LBP during a step-up task. Methods: A convenience sample of 37 participants included 19 with LBP and 18 without a history of LBP. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 65, and controls were matched to participants with LBP based on age, gender and BMI. A motion capture system was used to record spine and lower extremity kinematics during the step-up task. ANOVA tests were used to determine differences in three-dimensional kinematics between groups. Results: Participants with LBP displayed less lower lumbar motion in the sagittal plane (P = 0.001), more knee motion in the coronal plane (P = 0.001), and more lower extremity motion in the axial plane (P = 0.002) than controls. Conclusions: People with LBP display less lower lumbar spine motion in the sagittal plane and more out-of-plane lower extremity motion. Clinically, the step-up task can be used to identify these aberrant movements to develop more focused functional interventions for patients with LBP. Trial registration: Not applicable.

N2  - Background: Trunk axial rotation is a risk factor for chronic low back pain (CLBP). The characteristics of rotational mobility in the pelvis and spine among CLBP patients are not fully understood. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine three-dimensional kinematic changes, and to compare the differences of rotational mobility and coupled motion, in patients with and without CLBP. Methods: Fifteen patients with CLBP and 15 age and sex matched healthy subjects participated in this study. Each subject performed trunk rotation to maximum range of motion (ROM) in a standing position. The kinematics data was collected using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. The outcomes measured were the rotational ROM and the spine/pelvis ratio (SPR) in transvers plane at both maximum and 50% rotation position. The coupled angles in sagittal and frontal planes were also measured. Results: No significant differences in rotational ROM of the thorax, pelvis, and spine were observed between two groups at maximum rotation position. However, there was a significant interaction between groups and rotational ROM of pelvis and spine (F = 4.57, p = 0.04), and the SPR in CLBP patients was significantly greater than that of the healthy subjects (CLBP; 0.50 ± 0.10 Control; 0.41 ± 0.12, p = 0.04). The results at 50% rotation position were similar to that at maximum rotation. This indicates a relative increase in spinal rotation in the CLBP patients during trunk rotation. Moreover, the CLBP patients exhibited a significantly higher anterior tilt of the pelvis and extension of the spine in the sagittal plane coupled with rotation. Conclusions: CLBP patients had relative hyper rotational mobility of the spine as well as excessive spinal extension coupled with trunk rotation. These results suggest that uncoordinated trunk rotation might be a functional failure associated with CLBP.

N2  - Background: Clinical observation of aberrant movement patterns during active forward bending is one criterion used to identify patients with non-specific low back pain suspected to have movement coordination impairment. The purpose of this study was to describe and quantify kinematic patterns of the pelvis and trunk using a dynamics systems approach, and determine agreement between clinical observation and kinematic classification. Method: Ninety-eight subjects performed repeated forward bending with clinical observation and kinematic data simultaneously collected. Kinematic data were plotted using angle-angle, coupling-angle, and phase-plane diagrams. Accuracy statistics in conjunction with receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine agreement between clinical observation and kinematic patterns. Results: Kinematic patterns were consistent with clinical observation and definitions of typical and aberrant movement patterns with moderate agreement (kappa = 0.46-0.50; PABAK = 0.49-0.73). Early pelvic motion dominance in lumbopelvic coupling-angle diagram ≥59° within the first 38% of the movement represent observed altered lumbopelvic rhythm. Frequent disruptions in lumbar spine velocity represented by phase-plane diagrams with local minimum occurrences ≥6 and sudden decoupling in lumbopelvic coupling-angle diagrams with sum of local minimum and maximum occurrences ≥15 represent observed judder. Conclusion: These findings further define observations of movement coordination between the pelvis and lumbar spine for the presence of altered lumbopelvic rhythm and judder. Movement quality of the lumbar spine segment is key to identifying judder. This information will help clinicians better understand and identify aberrant movement patterns in patients with non-specific low back pain.

N2  - Low back pain (LBP) is suggested to be related to deconditioning of back muscles by a decreased capacity for hyperemia in exercising muscles. However, only inconsistent evidence exists regarding back muscle perfusion and oxygen saturation in healthy subjects and patients suffering from (chronic) LBP. Aim: We measured muscle perfusion in healthy subjects during the Biering-Sørensen (BS) test (the gold standard for evaluating back muscle endurance) using a commercial near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. We analysed data sets of five female healthy subjects (age: 34 ± 15 years) who reached the maximum of 4 min during the BS test. Muscle oxygenation (SmO2) and perfusion ([tHb]) were measured using the Moxy NIRS device (Fortiori Design LLC, Hutchinson, USA). Probes were set unilaterally on M. longissimus, M. iliocostalis and M. multifidus. Additionally, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), heart rate (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and lactate (pre, task, post) were measured. We observed (i) a large inter-subject variability in the SmO2 and [tHb] responses in the three muscles (i.e., SmO2 desaturations in the in M. longissimus across subjects during the task ranging from 1.1% to −56.6%), and (ii) a consistent response of the systemic signals in all subjects (i.e., increase in MAP, PP and HR). Lactate changes (post task minus task period) correlated with changes in PP and SmO2 of the multifidus muscle. Our preliminary results showed that during the BS test the response in the peripheral muscles was more variable than the central systemic response. A goal for future investigations is to explain this variability in the periphery by considering, for example, subject-specific changes in systemic cardiovascular activity, lactate and in the microvascular perfusion of muscle tissue.

N2  - Differences in synchronous movement between the trunk and lower limb during lifting have been reported in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients compared to healthy people. However, the relationship between movement coordination and disability in CLBP patients has not been investigated. A cross-sectional study was conducted to compare regional lumbar and lower limb coordination between CLBP (n = 43) and control (n = 29) groups. The CLBP group was divided into high- and low-disability groups based on their Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score. The mean absolute relative phase (MARP) angles and mean deviation phase (DP) between the (1) lumbar spine and hip, and (2) hip and knee were measured. The relationship between MARP angle and DP and ODI were investigated using linear regression. The higher-disability CLBP group demonstrated significantly greater lumbar-hip MARP angles than the lower-disability CLBP group (mean difference = 12.97, % difference = 36, p = 0.041, 95% CI [2.97, 22.98]). The higher-disability CLBP group demonstrated significantly smaller hip-knee DP than controls (mean difference = 0.11, % difference = 76, p = 0.011, 95% CI [0.03, 0.19]). There were no significant differences in lumbar-hip and hip-knee MARP and DP between the lower-disability CLBP and control groups. Lumbar-hip MARP was positively associated with ODI (R2 = 0.092, β = 0.30, p = 0.048). High-disability CLBP patients demonstrated decreased lumbar-hip movement coordination and stiffer hip-knee movement during lifting than low-disability CLBP patients and healthy controls.

N2  - There is evidence that patients with low back pain favor their trunk muscles when moving. However, it is unknown whether this maladaptive behavior is generalized across different functional tasks. This study analyzed the back muscle activity of patients with chronic low back pain compared to asymptomatic controls during five functional tasks. The secondary aim of this study was to test whether the electromyographic activity of patients’ back muscles was correlated with either the TAMPA scale score or the Örebro Questionnaire. Forty patients with chronic, non-specific low back pain and 40 asymptomatic participants were assessed on the electromyographic activity of the lumbar longissimus, ilio-costal and multifidus while picking up and placing an object on the ground, sitting down and standing up, and climbing stairs. There was statistical evidence of two-way interactions involving group by task (F4,308 = 7.921, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.049) and task by muscle (F18,1386 = 2.912, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.004), but not group by muscle (F7,539 = 1.104, p = 0.359, η2 = 0.004). Patients with chronic low back pain showed an increase in back muscle activity regardless of the type of functional task, except the left side of multifidus muscle during the picking up of a ball on the ground task. There was no correlation between the measure of kinesiophobia or the Örebro questionnaire score and the level of electromyographic activity.

N2  - Reduced postural control is thought to contribute to the development and persistence of chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP). It is therefore frequently assessed in affected patients and commonly reported as the average amount of postural sway while standing upright under a variety of sensory conditions. These averaged linear outcomes, such as mean centre of pressure (CP) displacement or mean CP surface areas, may not reflect the true postural status. Adding nonlinear outcomes and multi-segmental kinematic analysis has been reported to better reflect the complexity of postural control and may detect subtler postural differences. In this cross-sectional study, a combination of linear and nonlinear postural parameters were assessed in patients with CNLBP (n = 24, 24-75 years, 9 females) and compared to symptom-free controls (CG, n = 34, 22-67 years, 11 females). Primary outcome was postural control measured by variance of joint configurations (uncontrolled manifold index, UI), confidence ellipse surface areas (CEA) and approximate entropy (ApEn) of CP dispersion during the response phase of a perturbed postural control task on a swaying platform. Secondary outcomes were segment excursions and clinical outcome correlates for pain and function. Non-parametric tests for group comparison with P-adjustment for multiple comparisons were conducted. Principal component analysis was applied to identify patterns of segmental contribution in both groups. CNLBP and CG performed similarly with respect to the primary outcomes. Comparison of joint kinematics revealed significant differences of hip (P < .001) and neck (P < .025) angular excursion, representing medium to large group effects (r0s = .36 − .51). Significant (P0s < .05), but moderate correlations of ApEn (r = -.42) and UI (r = -.46) with the health-related outcomes were observed. These findings lend further support to the notion that averaged linear outcomes do not suffice to describe subtle postural differences in CNLBP patients with low to moderate pain status.

N2  - Surface electromyography (sEMG) studies have indicated that chronic low back pain (cLBP) involves altered electromyographic activity and morphological structure of the lumbar multifidus (LM) beyond pain perception; however, most studies have evaluated the superficial lumbar multifidus. It is difficult to record electromyography (EMG) signals from the deep multifidus (DM) to determine the neuromuscular activation patterns, making it difficult to determine the relationship between functional and structural changes in cLBP. We developed a novel method to record intramuscular EMG signals in the DM based on the sEMG system and fine-wire electrodes. We measured EMG signals of the DM in 24 cLBP patients and 26 pain-free healthy controls to identify changes in neuromuscular activation. We also used ultrasound to measure DM muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, and contraction activity to identify potential relationships between EMG activity and structural damage. cLBP patients had decreased average EMG and root mean square, but increased median frequency and mean power frequency. Average EMG was positively correlated with contractile activity, but not statistically correlated with noncontractile anatomical abnormalities. Our results suggest that cLBP alters the neuromuscular activation patterns and morphological structure of the contractile activity of the DM, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying pain perception.

N2  - Low back pain (LBP) remains one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders, while algorithms that able to recognise LBP patients from healthy population using balance performance data are rarely seen. In this study, human balance and body sway performance during standing trials were utilised to recognise chronic LBP populations using deep neural networks. To be specific, 44 chronic LBP and healthy individuals performed static standing tasks, while their spine kinematics and centre of pressure were recorded. A deep learning network with long short-term memory units was used for training, prediction and implementation. The performance of the model was evaluated by: (a) overall accuracy, (b) precision, (c) recall, (d) F1 measure, (e) receiver-operating characteristic and (f) area under the curve. Results indicated that deep neural networks could recognise LBP populations with precision up to 97.2% and recall up to 97.2%. Meanwhile, the results showed that the model with the C7 sensor output performed the best. Practitioner summary: Low back pain (LBP) remains the most common musculoskeletal disorder. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of applying artificial intelligent deep neural network in detecting LBP population from healthy controls with their kinematics data. Results showed a deep learning network can solve the above classification problem with both promising precision and recall performance.

N2  - Identification of kinetic variables in different masks of foot is important for the evaluation and treatment of chronic low back pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic idiopathic low back pain on kinetic variables of gait in different foot masks. 11 idiopathic chronic low back pain patients and 13 healthy matched controls participated in this study. Using Emed foot-scanner system, the ground reaction force and impulse were measured during barefoot normal walking. Then, the average footprints were divided into 10 masks using the Automask program and the data were extracted using Multimask Evaluation programs. The low back pain disability was measured by Quebec questionnaire. Our results revealed that the ground reaction force and impulse in medial and lateral midfoot and hallux masks of patients were significantly lower than controls. Furthermore, these patients demonstrated greater ground reaction force and impulse in 3–5th metatarsals mask than control group. There was a significant interaction between the low back pain and the foot masks factors. In conclusion, the ground reaction forces and impulses in different areas of foot are affected by low back pain. Therefore, the kinetic gait analysis should be considered as an appropriate tool in evaluation and prescribing proper treatment program in low back pain patients.

N2  - Background: Movement dysfunctions have been associated with persistent low back pain (LBP) but optimal treatment remains unclear. One possibility is that subgroups of persistent LBP patients have differing movement characteristics and therefore different responses to interventions. This study examined if there were patterns of flexion-related lumbo-pelvic kinematic and EMG parameters that might define subgroups of movement. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, observational study of 126 people without any history of significant LBP and 140 people with persistent LBP (n = 266). Wireless motion and surface EMG sensors collected lumbo-pelvic data on flexion parameters (range of motion (ROM) of trunk, lumbar, and pelvis), speed, sequence coordination and timing, and EMG extensor muscle activity in forward bending (flexion relaxation)), and sitting parameters (relative position, pelvic tilt range and tilt ratio). Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns in these parameters. Results: Four subgroups with high probabilities of membership were found (mean 94.9%, SD10.1%). Subgroup 1 (n = 133 people, 26% LBP) had the greatest range of trunk flexion, fastest movement, full flexion relaxation, and synchronous lumbar versus pelvic movement. Subgroup 2 (n = 73, 71% LBP) had the greatest lumbar ROM, less flexion relaxation, and a 0.9 s lag of pelvic movement. Subgroup 3 (n = 41, 83% LBP) had the smallest lumbar ROM, a 0.6 s delay of lumbar movement (compared to pelvic movement), and less flexion relaxation than subgroup 2. Subgroup 4 (n = 19 people, 100% LBP) had the least flexion relaxation, slowest movement, greatest delay of pelvic movement and the smallest pelvic ROM. These patterns could be described as standard (subgroup 1), lumbar dominant (subgroup 2), pelvic dominant (subgroup 3) and guarded (subgroup 4). Significant post-hoc differences were seen between subgroups for most lumbo-pelvic kinematic and EMG parameters. There was greater direction-specific pain and activity limitation scores for subgroup 4 compared to other groups, and a greater percentage of people with leg pain in subgroups 2 and 4. Conclusion: Four subgroups of lumbo-pelvic flexion kinematics were revealed with an unequal distribution among people with and without a history of persistent LBP. Such subgroups may have implications for which patients are likely to respond to movement-based interventions.

N2  - Background: Alterations in the activity of the lumbar erector spinae (LES) muscles on both sides of the spine have been inconsistently reported in patients with specific low back pain (sLBP) after measuring the muscular activity with surface electromyography (sEMG). It also remains unclear whether these alterations in LES activity can be related to the functional level of patients with sLBP. Research question: This study investigated the LES activity in patients with sLBP during activities of daily living (ADL) which included dynamic and static movement tasks. Moreover, the alterations in LES activity were correlated with the first seven questions of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ-SS). Methods: Thirty patients with specific LBP and twenty healthy subjects were recruited to perform five ADLs including 'static waist flexion’, 'sit to stand’,’ 30-seconds standing’, ‘6-minutes walking’ and ‘climbing stairs’. sEMG sensors were mounted on the left and right LES muscles. The integrated EMG (IEMG) was calculated from the preprocessed sEMG data as statistical comparison criteria. Results: LES activity was significantly higher in patients during 'sit to stand’,’ 30-seconds standing’ and ‘climbing stairs’ and significantly lower during 'static waist flexion’ compared to healthy controls. All tasks showed a significant correlation with the ZCQ-SS score except for ‘6-minutes walking’, whereby LES activity and ZCQ-SS score correspondingly increased during 'sit to stand’ and ‘climbing stairs’ and the LES activity decreased with an increasing ZCQ-SS score during 'static waist flexion’ and’ 30-seconds standing’. Significance: There was a high correlation between alterations in LES activity and the level of functionality in LBP patients. However, the LES activity showed an opposite behavior during static and dynamic movement tasks. The methodology presented can be a useful tool for quantifying improvements in functionality after rehabilitation processes.

N2  - Compensatory trunk and hip motions following slip perturbations may compromise the control of lumbopelvic movement. However, it is unclear how postural integration of the trunk and hips can be transferred to treadmill-induced slip perturbations in subjects with chronic low back pain (LBP). The purpose of this study was to investigate trunk reaction times and three-dimensional trunk-hip angle changes following a slip perturbation (duration: 0.12 sec, velocity: 1.37 m/sec, displacement: 8.22 cm) with a handheld task between subjects with and without chronic LBP. There were 23 subjects with LBP and 33 control subjects who participated in the study. The trunk reaction time was not significantly different between groups. However, the three-dimensional trunk-hip angle changes were significantly different following the perturbation. There were significant interactions between the body regions and three-dimensional angles between groups. There was a negative correlation between reaction time and trunk flexion in the LBP group. Overall, the LBP group demonstrated significantly reduced trunk flexion, which might be associated with reduced adaptability or a possible fear of avoidance strategy. Clinicians need to consider compensatory strategies to improve trunk flexibility following slip perturbations in subjects with chronic LBP. Mini abstract: Trunk reaction time and three-dimensional trunk-hip motions were compared between subjects with and without chronic low back pain (LBP). The control group demonstrated greater trunk flexion; however, the LBP group reduced trunk flexion to protect against further injuries following the novelty of the slip perturbation.

N2  - Background: Actigraphy is a quantitative method for the investigation of human physical activity and is normally based on accelerometric and/or kinematic data. Methods: A multichannel actigraphy system, able to record both acceleration and spine angles, was employed in this study to measure the quality of movement in 17 individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP) and 18 healthy individuals during unrestricted daily activities. An indication of movement complexity was computed by means of non-negative matrix factorization throughout the 24 hr period and in the 60 min of highest activity. Results: Movement complexity differed only when the 60 min of highest activity was taken into account, with the LBP group showing reduced complexity (e.g., for dimensionality = 8, over 90% of the comparisons showed a significant reduction in the LBP group). Conclusions: The results are compatible with the hypothesis that pain induces a reduction in the available kinematic trajectories and degrees of freedom during natural movements, which becomes more evident when more demanding tasks are performed. A reduced movement complexity suggests a persistent alteration of the descending neural pathways and/or a disrupted somatosensory information processing, which could be possibly contrasted by administering highly variable motor tasks. Significance: People with chronic pain move differently. Movement quality is difficult to evaluate during daily activities, yet it may prove more informative than quantitative measurements. We proposed a new approach for computing movement complexity and found out that patients’ movements get more stereotyped when higher spinal acceleration is required.

N2  - Objective: To investigate impairment in the activity pattern of some muscles involved in sit to stand (STD) and stand to sit (STS) among 2 low back pain (LBP) subgroups of the Movement System Impairment (MSI) model. Design: Case-control study. Setting: A university medical center. Participants: Fifteen women without chronic LBP and 22 women with chronic LBP (N=37) in 2 subgroups (15 into the lumbar extension rotation (LER) and 7 into lumbar flexion rotation [LFR]) voluntarily participated in this study. Interventions: Participants were asked to perform STD and STS at a preferred speed. Surface electromyography (EMG) were measured bilaterally from the internal oblique (IO), lumbar erector spine (ES), medial hamstring (MH), and lateral hamstring (LH) muscles. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in mean and maximum amplitude, time to peak amplitude, duration of muscle activity, and bilateral asymmetry of these variables. Results: During STD, bilateral asymmetry in mean amplitude of MH in the LER subgroup (P=.031) and bilateral asymmetry in duration of LH in the LFR subgroup (P=.026) were exhibited. Also, in this task reduced time to peak left MH activation were found in the LFR subgroup than 2 other groups (control; P=.028/LER; P=.004). During STS, increased left ES maximum amplitude were observed in the LFR subgroup than LER subgroup (P=.029). Also, reduced time to peak right ES (P=.035) and left LH (P=.038) activation in the LER subgroup than control subjects and reduced time to peak left LH activation in LFR subgroup than control subjects (P=.041) were observed during STS. Conclusions: The differences between the 2 LBP subgroups may be a result of impairment in the activity pattern of some muscles during functional activity.

N2  - Background: It has been found that alterations in passive muscle properties may be associated with low back pain, and these may be responsible for the altered gait parameters often observed in subjects with back pain. The purpose of the present study was to assess total hip and passive hip extensor moments in people with or without low back pain during the hip flexion component of walking. Methods: 52 subjects volunteered for this study (low back pain group, n = 25 (male n = 13, female n = 12), control group, n = 27 (male n = 15, female n = 12)). Passive hip moments were calculated using an adapted force transducer during supine testing. A biomechanical model and predictive equation were used to calculate passive hip moments during walking. Total hip moments were calculated with the use of a 9 camera, 3-D motion-capture system. Findings: Independent samples t-tests demonstrated no significant differences between groups for gait parameters or hip or knee angles. Results of the ANOVAs demonstrated significant differences in passive hip flexor moments during the second half of hip flexion (P < 0.05).There were also significant differences in hip power and work done during peaks of power absorption and the second peak of power generation (P < 0.05). Interpretation: The present data demonstrates that subjects with low back pain have altered passive hip extensor and total power and work done during walking compared with healthy controls. Biomechanical models should include individual measurements of passive joint moments.

N2  - Background: Spine posture, range of motion (ROM) and movement asymmetry can contribute to low back pain (LBP). These variables may have greater impact in populations required to perform repetitive spine movements, such as dancers; however, there is limited evidence to support this. Research question: What is the influence of dance and LBP on spinal kinematics? Methods: In this cross-sectional study, multi-segment spinal kinematics were examined in 60 female participants, including dancers (n = 21) and non-dancers (n = 39) with LBP (n = 33) and without LBP (n = 27). A nine-camera motion analysis system sampling at 100 Hz was used to assess standing posture, as well as ROM and movement asymmetry for side bend and trunk rotation tasks. A two-way ANOVA was performed for each of the outcome variables to detect any differences between dancers and non-dancers, or individuals with and without LBP. Results: Compared to non-dancers, dancers displayed a flatter upper lumbar angle when standing (p < 0.01, ηp 2 = 0.15), and achieved greater frontal plane ROM for the upper lumbar (p = 0.04, ηp 2 = 0.08) and lower thoracic (p = 0.02, ηp 2 = 0.09) segments. There were no differences between dancers and non-dancers for transverse plane ROM (p > 0.05) or movement asymmetry (p > 0.05). There was no main effect for LBP symptoms on any kinematic measures, and no interaction effect for dance group and LBP on spinal kinematics (p > 0.05). Significance: Female dancers displayed a flatter spine posture and increased spine ROM compared to non-dancers for a select number of spine segments and movement tasks. However, the overall number of differences was small, and no relationship was observed between LBP and spinal kinematics. This suggests that these simple, static posture, ROM, and asymmetry measures often used in clinical practice can provide only limited generalisable information about the impact of dance or LBP on spinal kinematics.

N2  - Background: Differences in movement variability may be related to a guarded response to pain or a less robust movement pattern, indicating a potential dysfunction in motor control. The study objective was to compare patterns of lumbo-pelvic coordinative variability, during repeated sit-to-stand-to-sit, in individuals with low back pain and healthy adults. Methods: Participants were adults with low back pain (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 21). Kinematics for the T12-L3, L3-S1, and hip segments were measured using electromagnetic motion capture during 10 sit-to-stand-to-sit trials. Continuous relative phase analysis using the Hilbert transform method determined coordination and variability of the Hip-L3S1, and L3S1-T12L3 segments, deconstructed into 4 periods (start/up/down/end). T-tests compared coordination and variability of the full task between groups, and a mixed ANOVA compared the effects of group and period for the two segments. Findings: Across the full task, the low back pain group demonstrated more variable (mean difference = −6.95, 95% CI = −12.3 to −1.59) and greater out-of-phase behavior (mean difference = −22.6, 95% CI = −39.1 to −6.03) in the LHip-L3S1 segment. Group-period interaction effects revealed greater variability in the start period (mean difference = −0.325, 95% CI = −0.493 to −0.156) and more out-of-phase behavior in the start (mean difference = −0.350, 95% CI = −0.549 to −0.150) and end (mean difference = −0.354, 95% CI = −0.602 to −0.105) periods for the LHip-L3S1 segment. Interpretation: Excessive variability may relate to reports of poor spinal proprioception in low back pain; however, based on our sample characteristics (low pain and disability) and lack of symptoms during the task, classifying our findings as dysfunctional may not be fully warranted.

N2  - Time to task failure (TTF) on the Sørensen test predicts low back pain (LBP), but mechanisms driving TTF may vary in those with and without recurrent LBP. To determine the physiological and psychological predictors of TTF, 48 sex, age, and BMI matched participants (24 Healthy, 24 LBP) completed psychological surveys, maximal strength assessments, and the Sørensen test. A two-way ANOVA revealed no significant effects of group (p = 0.75) or sex (p = 0.21) on TTF. In the full sample, linear regression analyses revealed that normalized Median Power Frequency (MPF) slope of the Erector Spinae (β = 0.350, p < 0.01), the Biceps Femoris (β = 0.375, p < 0.01), and self-efficacy (β = 0.437, p < 0.01) predicted TTF. In the Healthy group, normalized MPF slope of the Erector Spinae (β = 0.470, p < 0.01), the Biceps Femoris (β = 0.437, p < 0.01), and self-efficacy (β = 0.330, p = 0.02) predicted TTF. In the LBP group, trunk mass (β = −0.369, p = 0.04) and self-efficacy (β = 0.450, p = 0.02) predicted TTF. In sum, self-efficacy consistently predicts performance, while trunk mass appears to negatively influence TTF only for those with recurrent LBP.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN A controlled cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE To compare the kinematics of lumbar axial rotation while sitting in an upright and forward bending position in men suffering with and without nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Lumbar rotation while sitting is an important factor in the mechanism of low back pain. Nevertheless, its kinematics has scarcely been investigated. METHODS Range of motion (ROM in), average velocity (AV), maximum velocity (MV) and maximal acceleration (MA) of lumbar rotation while sitting in an upright (UP-sitting) and full forward bending position (FFB-sitting) were examined using an industrial lumbar motion monitor in 50 men (25 with NSCLBP and 25 controls). Pain level and the Rolland Morris questionnaire (RMQ) were also included. RESULTS All examined kinematical parameters were significantly lower in men with NSCLBP compared with the controls (↓ROM = 16%-29%; ↓AV = 35%-53%; ↓MV = 3%-46%; ↓MA = 7%-44%) and significantly decreased when moving from UP-sitting to FFB-sitting. In the UP-sitting, the ROM and AV in both groups and the right rotation-MV in the NSCLBP group were always greater during the right rotation compared to the left (NSCLBP = ROM: Δ3.92°, AV: Δ2.74°, MV:Δ3.61°; controls = ROM: Δ3.46°, AV: Δ1.72°). The left rotation-MV was significantly greater compared to the right only in FFB-sitting in the controls (Δ3.03°). In all kinematical parameters in the NSCLBP group, no correlations were found in the VAS levels (4.43 ± 1.47) or RMQ total score (12.32 ± 5.44). CONCLUSIONS The kinematic parameters of lumbar rotation were reduced in men with NSCLBP compared with controls both in an UP-sitting and FFB-sitting. In both groups, NSCLBP and controls, asymmetry in lumbar rotation kinematics, was indicated as well as a decrease when moving from UP-sitting to FFB-sitting. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 3.

N2  - Background: Lumbar flexion, coupled with rotation, is a dominant factor in the etiology and exacerbation of low back pain. Yet, no study has examined its kinematics in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). The aim of the study was to evaluate the lumbar rotation kinematics in neutral standing and with full flexion in men with NSCLBP. Methods: ROM, average velocity, maximum velocity and maximal acceleration of lumbar rotation in neutral standing and with full flexion were measured using an industrial lumbar motion monitor in 50 men (25 with NSCLBP and 25 controls). VAS and Rolland Morris questionnaire were also included. Findings: All examined kinematical parameters were significantly lower in men with NSCLBP compared with controls (↓ROM = 29%–45%; ↓AV = 40%–68%; ↓MV = 25%–50%; ↓MA = 20%–37%). Left rotation manifested smaller kinematic values (except for MA) than right rotation (Δ ROM = 35%; Δ AV = 66%; Δ MV = 19%) in NSCLBP. Most kinematical parameters significantly decreased from neutral standing to standing with flexion (right rotation: ↓ROM = 43%–45%, ↓AV = 38%–45%, ↓MV = 24%–27%, ↓MA for the NSCLBP group = 21%; left rotation: ↓ROM = 25%–38%, ↓AV in the control group: =34%, ↓MV in the control group: =23%, ↓MA in the control group = 25%). No correlations were found between all measured kinematical parameters, VAS and RMQ total score in the NSCLBP group. Interpretation: The kinematic parameters of lumbar rotation were reduced in men with NSCLBP compared with controls both in neutral standing and with fully forward bending. Most lumbar rotation kinematics decreased from neutral standing to standing with flexion.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that inherent differences in movement strategies exist between control subjects and those with a history of lower back pain (LBP). Previous motion analysis studies focus primarily on tracking spinal movements, neglecting the connection between the lower limbs and spinal function. Lack of knowledge surrounding the functional implications of LBP may explain the diversity in success from general treatments currently offered to LBP patients. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study evaluated the response of healthy controls and individuals with a history of LBP (hLBP) to a postural disturbance. METHODS: Volunteers (n = 26) were asked to maintain standing balance in response to repeated balance disturbances delivered via a perturbation platform while both kinematic and electromyographic data were recorded from the trunk, pelvis, and lower limb. RESULTS: The healthy cohort utilized an upper body-focused strategy for balance control, with substantial activation of the external oblique muscles. The hLBP cohort implemented a lower limb-focused strategy, relying on activation of the semitendinosus and soleus muscles. No significant differences in joint range of motion were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that particular reactive movement patterns may indicate muscular deficits in subjects with hLBP. Identification of these deficits may aid in developing specific rehabilitation programs to prevent future LBP recurrence.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain patients have been suggested to exhibit dysfunctional spinal movement patterns. However, there is a lack of clinically applicable but valid and reliable assessment tools, helping to discriminate normal and pathologically altered movement. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine whether kinematic parameters determined with an ultrasound-based motion analysis and thereof derived chromokinegraphical angle-time matrices (CATMAs) are able to discriminate between non-symptomatic and symptomatic movement behaviour in individuals with non-specific chronic (CLBP), specific low back pain (SLBP), and controls. METHODS: Thoracic and lumbar spine range of motion (ROM [â '']); angular velocity (V [â ''/sec]) and side-to-side differences [%] during a lateral flexion movement were assessed in 17 healthy participants, 16 individuals with CLBP and 11 SLBP patients. CATMAs ratings of two investigators (6-item Likert scale) were dichotomised, classifying the observed movement as physiological or non-physiological. Intrarater and interrater reliability were estimated using kappa statistics and Cronbach's Alpha. T-tests and a ROC analysis to determine optimal cut-offs for the separation of the collectives as well as contingency tables for selectivity of the cut-offs (motor outcomes) were calculated. RESULTS: CATMA ratings displayed partly moderate to good (rater B; i.e. CLBP vs. controls) and partly insufficient discriminant validity (rater A). Due to this, inter-rater reliability was poor (k= 0.061 to 0.135), while intra-rater-reliability was moderate to good for both raters (k= 0.329 to 0.625) except for SLBP vs. controls (rater A; k=-0.18). Regarding kinematics, group differences occurred neither in ROM nor in V (p> 0.05), but in terms of the relative side comparison between CLBP and controls (p<0.05). ROC analysis (CLBP vs. controls) revealed an optimal cut-off at side asymmetries of 16.9% (ROM) and 28.9% (V). Between SLBP patients and controls, no significant differences were observed neither in terms of the absolute values nor the relative side differences of both kinematic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Side asymmetries of V and ROM may be used to differentiate between controls and individuals with CLBP. CATMAs appear to be of limited diagnostic value for the identification of pathological spine movement.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic nonspecific low-back pain (CNSLBP) lack the flexion-relaxation phenomenon in full-trunk bending. This can be quantified by surface electromyography (SEMG) measurement of lumbar erector muscle. The study objective is to explore the clinical utility of the SEMG flexion-extension ratio (FER) in distinguishing patients with CNSLBP from painfree persons. METHODS: This was a comparative cross-sectional study. We adopted a balanced study design by recruiting 130 participants each for the CNSLBP and control arms. Each participant underwent dynamic SEMG measurement in full-trunk bending, which consisted of standing, flexion, relaxation, and extension. The FER ratio was the ratio of the maximum SEMG in flexion to the maximum SEMG during extension. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to identify optimal values of the FER and associated sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: The CNSLBP group and control group were generally comparable in terms of demographics and clinical profile. The CNSLBP group had higher SEMG amplitudes during flexion but lower SEMG during extension. The mean (SD) FER of the CNSLBP group was 0.90 (0.26), which was almost double that of controls 0.47 (0.14). The ROC curve identified an optimal FER cutoff of ≥ 0.692, for which sensitivity and specificity were 76.15% (95%confidence interval [CI], 68.14-82.66) and 98.46% (95%CI, 94.56-99.58). The diagnostic accuracy was 92.1% (95%CI, 88.70-95.54). CONCLUSION: The FER derived by lumbar muscle SEMG is able to distinguish patients with CNSLBP from pain-free people with excellent accuracy. This provides good evidence that a customized FER can be used in various clinical scenarios.

N2  - Background: Interventions for low back pain (LBP) commonly target 'dysfunctional' or atypical lumbo-pelvic kinematics in the belief that correcting aberrant movement improves patients' pain and activity outcomes. If atypical kinematic parameters and postures have a relationship to LBP, they could be expected to more prevalent in people with LBP compared to people without LBP (NoLBP). This exploratory study measured, defined and compared atypical kinematic parameters in people with and without LBP. Methods: Wireless inertial motion and EMG sensors were used to measure lumbo-pelvic kinematics during standing trunk flexion (range of motion (ROM), timing, sequence coordination, and extensor muscle activation) and in sitting (relative sitting position, pelvic tilt range) in a sample of 126 of adults without LBP and 140 chronic LBP subjects. Atypical movement was defined using the 10th/90th centiles of the NoLBP group. Mean differences and prevalence rates for atypical movement were calculated. Dichotomised pain scores for 'high-pain-on-bending' and 'high-pain-on-sitting' were tested for their association with atypical kinematic variables. Results: For standing flexion, significant mean differences, after adjusting for age and gender factors, were seen for the LBP group with (i) reduced ROM (trunk flexion (NoLBP 111 o , LBP 93 o , p <.0001), lumbar flexion (NoLBP 52 o , LBP 46 o , p <.0001), pelvic flexion (NoLBP 59 o , LBP 48 o , p <.0001), (ii) greater extensor muscle activation for the LBP group (NoLBP 0.012, LBP 0.25 p <.0001), (iii) a greater delay in pelvic motion at the onset of flexion (NoLBP - 0.21 s; LBP - 0.36 s, p = 0.023), (iv) and longer movement duration for the LBP group (NoLBP 2.28 s; LBP 3.18 s, p <.0001). Atypical movement was significantly more prevalent in the LBP group for small trunk (× 5.4), lumbar (× 3.0) and pelvic ROM (× 3.9), low FRR (× 4.9), delayed pelvic motion at 20 o flexion (× 2.9), and longer movement duration (× 4.7). No differences between groups were seen for any sitting parameters. High pain intensity was significantly associated with small lumbar ROM and pelvic ROM. Conclusion: Significant movement differences during flexion were seen in people with LBP, with a higher prevalence of small ROM, slower movement, delayed pelvic movement and greater lumbar extensor muscle activation but without differences for any sitting parameter.

N2  - Background: Altered spine kinematics are a common in people with LBP. This may be especially true for populations such as dancers, who are required to perform repetitive movements of the spine, although this remains unclear. Research question: Do dancers with recent LBP display altered spine kinematics compared to their asymptomatic counterparts? Methods: A cross-sectional study of multi-segment spine kinematics was performed. Forty-seven pre-professional and professional female dancers either with LBP in the past two months (n = 26) or no LBP in the past 12 months (n = 21) participated. Range of motion (ROM) during standing side bending, seated rotation, and walking gait were compared. Results: Female dancers with LBP displayed reduced upper lumbar transverse plane ROM in seated rotation (Effect Size (ES)= −0.61, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): −1.20, 0.02, p = 0.04), as well as reduced lower lumbar transverse plane ROM (ES=−0.65, 95% CI: −1.24, −0.06, p = 0.03) in gait. However, there was increased lower thoracic transverse plane ROM (ES = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.04, 1.21, p = 0.04) during gait. No differences in the frontal plane were observed. Significance: Altered transverse plane spine kinematics were evident in dancers with recent LBP for select segments and tasks. This may reflect a protective movement strategy. However, as the effect sizes of observed differences were moderate, and the total number of differences between groups was small, collectively, it seems only subtle differences in spine kinematics differentiate dancers with LBP to dancers without.

N2  - Background: Although delayed onset of the deep abdominal muscles activity in subjects with non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP) has been suggested to be related to trunk rotational torque, no study has examined the onsets associated with non-specific CLBP during a variety of tasks with different trunk rotational torque. The aim of this study is to compare the onsets of deep abdominal muscles activity among tasks with different trunk rotational torques in subjects with and without non-specific CLBP. Methods: Twelve subjects with non-specific CLBP and 13 control subjects were included. They performed 8 types of upper limb movements. The onsets of muscular activity of bilateral internal oblique-transversus abdominis (IO-TrA) and trunk rotational torque due to the upper limb movements were measured using a surface electromyography and a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results: In non-specific CLBP group, right IO-TrA activities were significantly delayed during tasks with left trunk rotational torque compared with the control (P < 0.05), while onsets of the left IO-TrA activities were significantly later than those of the control during tasks with right rotational torque of the trunk (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in onsets of both sides IO-TrA during tasks without trunk rotational torque between non-specific CLBP and control groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: The onsets of IO-TrA activities in subjects with non-specific CLBP were delayed during tasks with rotational torque of the trunk in the opposite direction, suggesting a possibility that delayed onset of the deep abdominal muscles during rotational torque of the trunk might be etiology of chronic low back pain.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the relationship between lumbar multifidus (LM) morphology, function, echo-intensity (EI) and body composition among a group of university level ice hockey players with and without low back pain (LBP). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University Research Centre. Participants: Thirty-two hockey players (18 females, 14 males) participated in this study. Main outcome measures: Resting LM cross-sectional area (CSA) was assessed bilaterally at the L5 level in prone and standing using ultrasound imaging. The LM thickness at rest and during contraction was evaluated in addition to LM EI. Body composition measures were acquired using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and LBP history was acquired using a self-reported questionnaire. Results: LM muscle CSA was significantly associated with body composition measurements. LM EI was strongly associated with total % body fat and significantly greater in females. Resting LM muscle CSA and thickness (prone) was significantly smaller in players with LBP 4-weeks prior. LM side-to-side asymmetry (standing) was also significantly greater in players with LBP 3-months prior. Conclusion: The results provide new insights with regards to LM morphology and activation in ice hockey players and revealed specific deficits in LM morphology in athletes with LBP. LM morphology was strongly associated with body composition measurements.

N2  - Repetitive lumbopelvic rotation (LPR) during active limb movements has been indicated as a factor that contributes to low back pain (LBP). Prior studies suggest that people with LBP demonstrate greater and earlier LPR during limb movements in prone. We examined timing and magnitude of LPR during sitting active knee extension in people with and without LBP. We also investigated differences of LPR during active and passive knee extension in LBP group. 38 men (mean age: 38.4)10.6) years) with chronic mechanical LBP and 38 matched healthy men (mean age: 36.6(8.4) years) were examined. Kinematic data were collected by motion capture system and analyzed using OpenSim software. The difference between the start time of knee extension and start time of LPR was calculated and was normalized to knee extension movement time. Maximum angular displacement for LPR was also calculated across time. People with LBP demonstrated earlier LPR during knee extension than healthy subjects (P < 0.01). There was, however, no difference in maximum LPR between groups. LBP group also demonstrated greater and earlier LPR during active than during passive knee extension (P < 0.01). Earlier LPR during limb movements in sitting may be related to LBP. Quadriceps muscle activity and inefficient trunk muscles activation may contribute to early LPR in LBP group. A greater understanding of the factors that may contribute to early LPR during daily activities can provide information to guide rehabilitation treatment for people with LBP.

N2  - Background: Impaired lumbar movement has cross-sectionally been associated with low back pain (LBP); however, the consequence of impaired movement on disability and pain in persons with LBP is poorly understood. Furthermore, fear-avoidance beliefs (FAB) may influence spinal movement, but the relation between fear-avoidance and kinematics is unclear. Objectives: To investigate the longitudinal associations of kinematics and FAB with disability, work ability and pain in patients with LBP. Further, to explore associations between FAB and kinematics. Design: Prospective observational study. Method: Kinematic measures were performed on 44 persons with LBP at baseline, three and nine months. Motion sensors identified range-of-motion and velocity during a spinal flexion/extension. FAB, disability, work ability and pain were reported at all time points using questionnaires. Results: Increased range-of-motion was weakly associated with less disability (−0.14 points, 95% CI -0.22 to −0.06). Velocity was not associated with disability, work ability or pain. Higher FAB of physical activity were associated with more disability (1.50 points, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.49) and pain (0.37 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62). Higher work-related FAB was associated with lower work ability (−0.37 points, 95% CI -0.68 to −0.05). Moreover, higher FAB showed weak associations with lower velocity in the initial movement phase (−3.3°/s, 95% CI -6.1 to −0.5). Conclusions: Of the kinematic measures, only range-of-motion was related to disability. Higher FAB was weakly associated with all self-reported outcomes and with lower velocity only at the initial flexion phase. However, the magnitude of these associations suggest marginal clinical importance.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to compare diaphragm thickness and excursion between athletes with and without lumbopelvic pain (LPP) by trans-costal and trans-hepatic rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI), respectively. Design: A case-control study. Setting: Amateur and semiprofessional athletes teams. Participants: Forty matched-paired athletes with LPP (n = 20; LPP case group) and without LPP (n = 20; Healthy control group) were recruited. Main outcome measures: Diaphragm thickness and excursion (cm) were assessed during relaxed respiratory activity (maximum inspiration–T ins , expiration–T exp and difference–T ins-exp ) by trans-costal and trans-hepatic rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI), respectively. Results: Statistically significant differences (P <.05) with an effect size from moderate to large (d = 0.63–1.07) were shown for bilateral diaphragm thickness reductions at T ins and thickness difference at T ins -T exp of the right hemi-diaphragm for athletes with LPP compared to healthy athletes. Conclusions: Athletes who suffered from LPP presented a reduced diaphragm thickness compared to healthy matched-paired athletes. Therefore, these novel findings may suggest that diaphragm reeducation could be a main focus of intervention related to athletic performance, prevention and rehabilitation. Nevertheless, these findings should be considered with caution due to the possible influence of the RUSI measurement errors of the diaphragm activation during normal breathing.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in passive muscular stiffness between the superficial multifidus (SM)and deep multifidus (DM), and to compare their passive and active stiffness in individuals with low back pain (LBP)and asymptomatic individuals. Fifteen LBP individuals and 15 asymptomatic individuals were recruited. Passive stiffness of the SM and DM was measured bilaterally using sheer wave elastography (SWE)with participants lying prone. Active stiffness was measured for the SM during trunk extension, and the contraction ratio was calculated. DM displayed higher passive muscular stiffness than SM in both the asymptomatic and LBP groups (14.41 ± 2.62 and 15.40 ± 2.77 kPa respectively; t = 7.765 and t = 3.864, p < 0.05). Individuals with LBP exhibited higher passive muscular stiffness of SM (LBP: 10.15 ± 4.21, asymptomatic: 6.84 ± 1.69 kPa; t = 3.002, p < 0.05)and a lower contraction ratio (LBP: 1.54 ± 0.47, asymptomatic: 2.65 ± 1.36 kPa; p < 0.05)compared to the asymptomatic group. The findings support a differentiation in passive muscular stiffness between SM and DM and provide evidence for an alteration in muscular stiffness at rest in individuals with LBP. The lower increase of muscular stiffness with contraction observed for those with LBP may reflect a deficit in activation of the multifidus.

N2  - Study Design.A cross-sectional comparative study.Objective.The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between the FR phenomenon asymmetry of lumbar muscles and trunk lateral range of motion (ROM) asymmetry in nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) patients.Summary of Background Data.Imbalance in trunk muscle activation between right and left sides can induce pain by loading the spine incorrectly, especially in patients with NSCLBP. A previous study reported a greater asymmetry in the FR phenomenon of the erector spinae in NSCLBP patients than in asymptomatic participants (APs). Imbalance of muscle properties, such as trunk ROM, has been suggested as a possible cause of this observed asymmetry.Methods.Twenty-eight NSCLBP patients and 22 AP performed 3 standing maximal trunk flexions. Surface electromyography was recorded bilaterally for erector spinae longissimus and lumbar multifidus. A FR ratio was calculated for each muscle. The fingertip-to-thigh test was performed to assess trunk lateral ROM. Each parameter's asymmetry was calculated as the absolute difference between right and left sides.Results.NSCLBP patients present a significantly lower trunk lateral ROM than AP. FR ratio asymmetry of the erector spinae was significantly greater in NSCLBP patients than in AP (P<0.05). FR ratio asymmetry of the multifidus and trunk lateral ROM asymmetry were not significantly different between groups. Significant correlation (r=0.49) between FR ratio asymmetry of erector spinae and trunk lateral ROM asymmetry was observed only for patients with NSCLBP.Conclusion.The present findings showed that FR ratio asymmetry of erector spinae longissimus is moderately correlated with trunk lateral ROM asymmetry. In addition, the results confirmed that patients with NSCLBP present a reduced trunk lateral ROM, a FR ratio asymmetry of the erector spinae which is correlated with trunk rotation. These findings suggested an imbalance spine loading which can contribute to the persistence of pain.Level of Evidence: 3.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of a history of low back pain (LBP) on pelvic and lumbar kinematics during baseball hitting. Twenty collegiate male baseball players (age, 21±1 years; height, 172.8±4.7 cm; weight, 72.7±6.2 kg; baseball experience, 13±1 years) performed 5 bat swings. Participants were categorized into the LBP group (n=10) or control group (n=10) based on having experienced lumbar spine pain due to bat swing that lasted more than 24 h within the last 12 months. Three-dimensional kinematic data of the pelvis and lumbar spine during bat swing were measured. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare pelvic and lumbar kinematics throughout the bat swing between groups, and independent t-tests were used to compare the other outcomes between groups. There was a significant main effect between groups in lumbar flexion angle throughout the bat swing (p=0.047). The mean lumbar flexion angle of the LBP group throughout the bat swing was less than that of the control group. Additionally, the peak angular velocity of lumbar flexion of the LBP group was significantly faster than that of control group (p=0.047). These results can be helpful for longitudinal studies that identify the risk factors of LBP due to bat swing.

N2  - Objective Low back pain is a pathology associated to a trunk extensors muscles weakness. Studies suggested that it could be associated with an inadequacy between oxygen demand and oxygen utilization by paraspinal muscles (Kell and Bhambhani, 2006). In contrast to chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients, judo athletes are characterized by a great trunk extensors muscles endurance, due to their intensive solicitation within sport practice. Our purpose was to compare aerobic metabolism in those muscles of CLBP patients with judo athletes. Patients and methods Ten judokas and 11 CLBP completed a submaximal isokinetic trunk extension exercise at 60°/s (70% of the maximal total work performed in Continuous Passive Motion mode during one repetition) during 5 min. The flexion at 30°/s was passive. Oxygenation and muscular blood volume (BVm) were evaluated by using near infrared spectroscopy. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured by using metabolic gaz analyser. Total work performed during exercise (TT) was measured by the dynamometer. Results TT and VO2 were lower in CLBP (P < 0.05), whereas the ratio VO2/TT was greater in CLBP (P < 0.05). BVm decreased significantly only for CLBP during exercise (P < 0.05). Muscular desoxygenation increased significantly only for the judokas group (P < 0.05). Discussion/Conclusion This study brings out the weakness of paraspinal muscle in CLPB, and the diminution of the motor efficiency during a submaximal exercise, compared to judo athletes. Our results suggest that it is associated to a diminution of BVm and a lower O2 extraction in paraspinal muscles. It could suggest a diminution of the paraspinal muscles aerobic fitness in CLBP patient.

N2  - The study design is a prospective, case-control. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable measurement technique for the assessment of lumbar spine kinematics using digital video fluoroscopy in a group of patients with low back pain (LBP) and a control group. Lumbar segmental instability (LSI) is one subgroup of nonspecific LBP the diagnosis of which has not been clarified. The diagnosis of LSI has traditionally relied on the use of lateral functional (flexion-extension) radiographs but use of this method has proven unsatisfactory. Fifteen patients with chronic low back pain suspected to have LSI and 15 matched healthy subjects were recruited. Pulsed digital videofluoroscopy was used to investigate kinematics of lumbar motion segments during flexion and extension movements in vivo. Intersegmental linear translation and angular displacement, and pathway of instantaneous center of rotation (PICR) were calculated for each lumbar motion segment. Movement pattern of lumbar spine between two groups and during the full sagittal plane range of motion were analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measures design. Intersegmental linear translation was significantly higher in patients during both flexion and extension movements at L5-S1 segment (p < 0.05). Arc length of PICR was significantly higher in patients for L1-L2 and L5-S1 motion segments during extension movement (p < 0.05). This study determined some kinematic differences between two groups during the full range of lumbar spine. Devices, such as digital videofluoroscopy can assist in identifying better criteria for diagnosis of LSI in otherwise nonspecific low back pain patients in hope of providing more specific treatment. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - This study investigated back muscle fatigability of the erector spinae (ES) muscles during submaximal contractions with the use of surface electromyography (sEMG). It was important to confirm the reliability of measurements for characterizing neuromuscular alterations by establishing the difference between the Shannon (information) entropy and the power spectrum analysis in subjects with low back pain (LBP). The data was collected on two different days, one week apart, and the between-days reliability of these measures was examined. Thirty-two gender-matched subjects completed the modified Sorenson test; 16 of the subjects were female while 16 were male. The entropy of the sEMG signal was more reliable than either the median frequency (MF) or the slope of the MF. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was higher for the entropy than for the MF slope. The ICC values of entropy for between-day measurements were higher (0.82-0.85) than MF (0.54-0.64) and MF slope (0.26-0.30). The standard errors of measurement (SEM) values for entropy were lower (0.04-0.05) than MF (3.10-3.60) and MF slope (0.03-0.04). The Pearson correlation coefficients of the entropy were significantly higher (0.75-0.77) than those of the MF (0.38-0.47) and the MF slope (0.15-0.18). Therefore, the results of this study indicated that the entropy analysis could provide a reliable measure of muscle fatigability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN. A cross-sectional comparative study between healthy controls and two subgroups of nonspecific chronic low back pain (LBP) patients. OBJECTIVES. To determine differences in trunk muscle activation during usual unsupported sitting. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Patients with LBP commonly report exacerbation of pain on sitting. Little evidence exists to confirm that subgroups of patients with nonspecific chronic LBP patients use different motor patterns in sitting than pain-free controls. METHODS. A total of 34 pain-free and 33 nonspecific chronic LBP subjects were recruited. Two blinded clinicians classified nonspecific chronic LBP patients into two subgroups (active extension pattern and flexion pattern). Surface electromyography (sEMG) was recorded from five trunk muscles during subjects' unsupported "usual" and "slumped" sitting. RESULTS. No differences in trunk muscle activity were observed between healthy controls and nonspecific chronic LBP groups for usual sitting. When the classification system was applied, differences were identified. Compared with no-LBP controls, the active extension pattern group presented with higher levels of cocontraction of superficial fibers of lumbar multifidus (12%), iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis (36%) and transverse fibers of internal oblique (43%). while the flexion pattern group showed a trend toward lower activation patterns (lumbar multifidus, -7%; iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis, -6%, and transverse fibers of internal oblique, -5%). The flexion relaxation ratio of the back muscles was lower for nonspecific chronic LBP (superficial lumbar multifidus: t = 4.5; P < 0.001 and iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis:t = 2.7; P < 0.001), suggesting a lack of flexion relaxation for the nonspecific chronic LBP. CONCLUSION. Subclassifying nonspecific chronic LBP patients revealed clear differences in sEMG activity during sitting between pain-free subjects and subgroups of nonspecific chronic LBP patients. ©2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - This investigation examined surface electromyography as an additional tool in the comprehensive clinical evaluation of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Electromyographic signals from electrodes placed in the lumbar area of 30 CLBP patients and 30 non-pain control subjects were compared. Patients and controls were matched for age, gender, and body mass index. Paired t test showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The muscle activity mean values were threefold higher in CLBP patients than in controls (P < 0.00001) in the static testing, and twofold higher in CLBP patients than in controls (P < 0.00001) in the dynamic testing. Our findings indicate that surface electromyography assessment of the paraspinal muscle activity may be a useful objective diagnostic tool in the comprehensive evaluation of CLBP.

N2  - Objective: To study the skin temperature disorders in low back pain (LBP) patients compared with reference persons without LBP and to evaluate the relationship between pain intensity and other clinical signs and temperature abnormalities. Methods: Sixty-five patients with unilateral chronic LBP with or without referred nonradicular leg pain (29 men and 36 women; age range, 30-51 years) and 20 reference persons without LBP (7 men and 13 women; age range, 30-49 years) participated in this study. The pain level was recorded by the use of a visual analog scale (0-100). Questionnaires and a series of spinal mobility tests (the modified Schober, straight leg-raising test, finger-floor distance, side bending) were used. Thermographic images of the low back area and legs (anterior, lateral, and posterior surfaces and the plantar surfaces of feet) were taken with an infrared video camera. Results: The temperature changes in the plantar surface correlated with LBP intensity. The pain levels differed in the groups with the different types of temperature changes. There were significant lower extremity regional skin temperature alterations (at least 1 regional interside difference more than 0.3°C) in most cases both in LBP patients and in reference persons, but plantar interside temperature difference was significantly higher in LBP patients. Conclusion: Temperature changes of the plantar surface seem to be connected with LBP intensity. Temperature measurements may be useful as an adjunctive physiological test in the evaluation and documentation of autonomic dysfunction in LBP patients. © 2006 National University of Health Sciences.

N2  - Objectives: To compare the relative thickness change of the transversal abdominal (TrA) and lumbar multifidus (LM) muscles during activation in individuals with and without low back pain (LBP), and to establish a relationship between surface electromyography (sEMG) signal amplitude and the relative thickness change of the corresponding muscle during clinically relevant activity, with preferential activation of TrA/LM. Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven pain-free participants and 36 LBP patients were assessed by ultrasound for thickness changes of TrA and LM and by sEMG for changes of electrical activity of the same muscles. sEMG is done with wireless LUMBIA system. The position of the sEMG sensors and activation maneuvers were chosen carefully. Results: Significant group effect was found for relative thickness change of TrA (F 1,142 =60.69, P<0.0001) and LM (F 1,142 =36.01, P<0.0001). We found significant correlations between relative thickness change of TrA and sEMG signal amplitude on both sides for LBP (r=0.46 to 0.63, P<0.05) and pain-free patients (r=0.43-0.47, P<0.05). The correlation between LM thickness change and sEMG was significant in pain-free participants for both sides (r=0.36 to 0.38 P<0.05), and right LM in LBP participants (r=0.43, P<0.05), but not for LM in LBP group (r=0.16, P=0.351). Discussion: US and sEMG measurements can be used for objective TrA/LM assessment. Correlation results suggest that the relative change of the muscle thickness could be used as the indicator of the muscle activity. Insight into the activity of TrA/LM in pain-free individuals and LBP patients during and after painful episodes may clarify the role of functional abnormalities of these muscles in LBP. ©

N2  - Objective: To analyze muscle activation patterns during various footplate perturbations, used as proprioceptive challenges in patients with low back pain (LBP) and in controls. Design: A prospective and controlled comparative study. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Twenty subjects with chronic LBP and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Interventions: The subjects underwent 5 sets of footplate perturbations in 3 directions with 16 perturbations for each set. Main Outcome Measures: Latency, frequency, and asymmetry of muscle activation of the erector spinae, rectus abdominus, anterior tibialis, and gastrocnemius muscles were measured bilaterally with surface electromyography. Results: In the toes-up movements, subjects with LBP were significantly less likely to activate their rectus abdominus muscles (P=.02), and they were more likely to exhibit asymmetric muscle activation in the smaller forward movements (odds ratio=4.1, P=.03). The latter result appears to be driven by asymmetric contraction of the erector spinae and rectus abdominus. Conclusions: Significantly more subjects with LBP than control subjects exhibited absent firing of trunk muscles during 2 of the 5 footplate perturbations. These results suggest an abnormality of the neuromuscular loop and may represent altered proprioception. © 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

N2  - Background context Alterations of the neuromuscular control of the lumbar spine have been reported in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP). During trunk flexion and extension tasks, the reduced myoelectric activity of the low back extensor musculature observed during full trunk flexion is typically absent in patients with chronic LBP. Purpose To determine whether pain expectations could modulate neuromuscular responses to experimental LBP to a higher extent in patients with chronic LBP compared with controls. Study design A cross-sectional, case-control study. Patient sample Twenty-two patients with nonspecific chronic LBP and 22 age- and sex-matched control participants. Methods Trunk flexion-extension tasks were performed under three experimental conditions: innocuous heat, noxious stimulation with low pain expectation, and noxious stimulation with high pain expectation. Noxious stimulations were delivered using a contact heat thermode applied on the skin of the lumbar region (L4-L5), whereas low or high pain expectations were induced by verbal and visual instructions. Outcome measures Surface electromyography of erector spinae at L2-L3 and L4-L5, as well as lumbopelvic kinematic variables were collected during the tasks. Pain was evaluated using a numerical rating scale. Pain catastrophizing, disability, anxiety, and fear-avoidance beliefs were measured using validated questionnaires. Results Two-way mixed analysis of variance revealed that pain was significantly different among the three experimental conditions (F2,84=317.5; p<.001). Increased myoelectric activity of the low back extensor musculature during full trunk flexion was observed in the high compared with low pain expectations condition at the L2-L3 level (F2,84=9.5; p<.001) and at the L4-L5 level (F2,84=3.7; p=.030). At the L4-L5 level, this effect was significantly more pronounced for the control participants compared with patients with chronic LBP (F2,84=3.4; p=.045). Pearson correlation analysis revealed that increased lumbar muscle activity in full flexion induced by expectations was associated with higher pain catastrophizing in patients with chronic LBP (r=0.54; p=.012). Conclusions Repeated exposure to pain appears to generate rigid and less variable patterns of muscle activation in patients with chronic LBP, which attenuate their response to pain expectations. Patients with high levels of pain catastrophizing show higher myoelectric activity of lumbar muscles in full flexion and exhibit greater neuromechanical changes when expecting strong pain. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: The aims of this study were to assess lumbar multifidus fatigue (LM) and transversus abdominis activation (TrA) in individuals with lumbar disc herniation associated with low back pain. Methods: Sixty individuals were divided into the lumbar herniation (LHG, n = 30) and control groups (CG, n = 30). Fatigue of the LM was assessed using surface electromyography during the Sorensen effort test, and activation of the TrA with a pressure biofeedback unit. Pain intensity was determined using a visual analog scale and the McGill pain questionnaire. The Oswestry disability questionnaire and the Borg scale for self-evaluating exertion were used to assess functional disability. Results: Fatigue was significantly more intense and the TrA activation was insufficient (p < 0.01) in individuals with disc herniation relative to the control group. The LHG had mild functional disability and moderate pain. There were differences in the initial exertion self-evaluation between groups, which were not observed in the final exertion evaluation. Conclusion: Individuals with lumbar disc herniation associated with low back pain have increased fatigue of the LM and decreased activation of the TrA, when compared to the control group.

N2  - Purpose: To identify and characterize trunk neuromuscular adaptations during muscle fatigue in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) and healthy participants.
Methods: Forty-six patients with non-specific chronic LBP and 23 healthy controls were asked to perform a trunk muscles fatigue protocol. Surface electromyography was recorded using two adhesive matrix of 64 electrodes applied bilaterally over the erector spinae. Pain score, kinesiophobia and physical disability were analyzed through different questionnaires. To characterize motor variability, dispersion of muscular activity center of gravity was computed. Motor variability between groups was compared using repeated-measures analyses of variance.
Results: Score of disability and kinesiophobia were significantly higher in patients with LBP. Results indicated a significant group effect characterized by an increased motor variability in the healthy group through the entire fatigue task on the left (p = 0.003) and right side (p = 0.048). Interestingly, increasing muscle fatigue led to increased motor variability in both groups (on both sides (p < 0.001) but with a greater increase in the healthy group.
Conclusion: Muscle recruitment is altered in patients with chronic LBP in the presence of muscle fatigue. Consequently, these patients exhibit changes in muscle recruitment pattern and intensity (lower levels of motor variability) during sustained isometric contraction that may be attributed to variation in the control of motor units within and between muscles. However, patients with LBP are able to increase their motor variability over time but with a lower increase compared to healthy participants.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare back muscle fatigue of younger and older participants with and without chronic low back pain (CLBP). Twenty participants without and 20 with nonspecific CLBP participated in this study. Each group contained 10 younger (50% males; mean age: 31 ± 6. yrs) and 10 older adults (50% males; age mean: 71 ± 7. yrs). Two isometric fatigue protocols were presented randomly: (1) to maintain the unsupported trunk at the horizontal position while on a 45° Roman chair for a minute, and (2) to maintain a 10% of body weight box close to the trunk in the upright position for a minute. Surface electromyography (EMG) signals from the back (multifidus and iliocostalis) and one hip (biceps femoris) muscles were recorded bilaterally, and the median frequency fatigue estimate from linear regression slopes of the EMG time-series was computed. There were no significant (P>. 0.05) age effects, and group-by-age interaction in both isometric and functional fatigue tasks. However, the CLBP groups (both younger and old) displayed more back fatigue than people without CLBP in both fatigue protocols (P< 0.01; effect size varying of d= 0.17-0.32). This study was sensitive to discriminate that individuals with CLBP did present significantly more pronounced EMG back fatigue than people without CLBP, in both younger and older adults. These results have significant clinical implications for low back pain rehabilitation programs with regard to endurance assessment in both younger and older.

N2  - Background: Trunk muscle fatigue has high relevance in human performance. Most authors agree that the use of the median frequency is preferred as a fatigue indicator. Most work has to date, been done on dynamic fatigue measurements, using the similarity index (SI). Objective: Repeated trunk flexion-extensions were measured using the B200 Isostation. Muscle activity was recorded by surface electromyography (EMG) in order to evaluate fatigue of trunk flexor and extensor muscles. Twenty male university students participated in this pilot study, including 6 apparently healthy subjects with a history of low back pain (LBP), and 14 healthy matched controls. All participants were instructed to perform repeated trunk flexion-extension against 50% of their back extensors maximal volutary contractions (MVCs) resistance until they could no longer perform the task. The SI was calculated from quantitative analysis of EMG data recording during dynamic trunk flexion extension task. Median frequency was also measured before and after fatiguing contractions. Results: The results of this study revealed a significant decrease in the SI and median frequency measurements following fatigue in both groups (p< 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that in both groups changes in SI measurements following fatigue are in agreement with the changes in median frequency measurements. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Movement control impairments (MCI) are often present in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (NS-CLBP). Therefore, movement control exercises are widely used to rehabilitate patients. However, the objective assessment remains difficult.The purpose of this study was to develop a statistical model, based on logistic regression analysis, to differentiate patients with NS-CLBP presenting a flexion-related MCI from healthy subjects. This model is based on trunk muscle activation patterns measured by surface electromyography (sEMG), during movement control exercises.Sixty-three healthy male subjects and 36 male patients with a flexion-related MCI participated in this study. Muscle activity of the internal obliques, the external obliques, the lumbar multifidus and the thoracic part of the iliocostalis was registered. Ratios of deep stabilizing to superficial torque producing muscle activity were calculated to examine trunk muscle recruitment patterns during 6 different exercises. Logistic regression analyses were performed (1) to define the ratios and exercises that were most discriminating between patients and non-patients, (2) to make a predictive model. K-Fold cross-validation was used to assess the performance of the predictive model.This study demonstrated that sEMG trunk muscle recruitment patterns during movement control tests, allows differentiating NSCLBP patients with a flexion-related MCI from healthy subjects.

N2  - Background context Nonsurgical rehabilitation therapy is a commonly used strategy to treat chronic low back pain (LBP). The selection of the most appropriate therapeutic options is still a big challenge in clinical practices. Surface electromyography (sEMG) topography has been proposed to be an objective assessment of LBP rehabilitation. The quantitative analysis of dynamic sEMG would provide an objective tool of prognosis for LBP rehabilitation. Purpose To evaluate the prognostic value of quantitative sEMG topographic analysis and to verify the accuracy of the performance of proposed time-varying topographic parameters for identifying the patients who have better response toward the rehabilitation program. Study design A retrospective study of consecutive patients. Patient sample Thirty-eight patients with chronic nonspecific LBP and 43 healthy subjects. Outcome measures The accuracy of the time-varying quantitative sEMG topographic analysis for monitoring LBP rehabilitation progress was determined by calculating the corresponding receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Physiologic measure was the sEMG during lumbar flexion and extension. Methods Patients who suffered from chronic nonspecific LBP without the history of back surgery and any medical conditions causing acute exacerbation of LBP during the clinical test were enlisted to perform the clinical test during the 12-week physiotherapy (PT) treatment. Low back pain patients were classified into two groups: "responding" and "nonresponding" based on the clinical assessment. The responding group referred to the LBP patients who began to recover after the PT treatment, whereas the nonresponding group referred to some LBP patients who did not recover or got worse after the treatment. The results of the time-varying analysis in the responding group were compared with those in the nonresponding group. In addition, the accuracy of the analysis was analyzed through ROC curves. Results The time-varying analysis showed discrepancies in the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) parameters between the responding and nonresponding groups. The relative area (RA) and relative width (RW) of RMSD at flexion and extension in the responding group were significantly lower than those in the nonresponding group (p<.05). The areas under the ROC curve of RA and RW of RMSD at flexion and extension were greater than 0.7 and were statistically significant. Conclusions The quantitative time-varying analysis of sEMG topography showed significant difference between the healthy and LBP groups. The discrepancies in quantitative dynamic sEMG topography of LBP group from normal group, in terms of RA and RW of RMSD at flexion and extension, were able to identify those LBP subjects who would respond to a conservative rehabilitation program focused on functional restoration of lumbar muscle. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: The present study aimed to compare the neuromuscular response under various mechanical stimulations of the lumbar spine in participants with and without chronic low back pain (cLBP). Methods: Four mechanical stimulations, characterized by forces ranging from 75 to 225 N, were delivered using a servo-controlled linear actuator motor to the L3 spinous process of 25 healthy participants and 26 participants with cLBP. Lumbar neuromuscular responses were recorded using 64-electrodes large surface electromyography arrays. Between-group differences in the dose-response relationship (neuromuscular response amplitude according to each force level) were assessed using mixed model ANOVAs. Results: No differences between groups were shown (all p values > .05). A significant linear relationship was observed between forces and neuromuscular response amplitudes (p < .001) indicating an increase in response amplitudes with increasing stimulation force. Responses were observed throughout the lumbar region with highest response amplitudes in the vicinity of the contacted vertebra. Conclusion: The neuromuscular response amplitude triggered by localized lumbar mechanical stimulations does not differ between participants with and without cLBP. Moreover, even though stimulations were delivered at specific spinal segment, a neuromuscular response, although rapidly decreasing, was observed in areas distant from the contact site.

N2  - Purpose: This systematic literature review aimed at examining the validity and applicability in everyday clinical rehabilitation practise of methods for the assessment of back muscle fatiguability in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP). Methods: Extensive research was performed in MEDLINE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases from their inception to September 2014. Potentially relevant articles were also manually looked for in the reference lists of the identified publications. Studies examining lumbar muscle fatigue in people with CNSLBP were selected. Two reviewers independently selected the articles, carried out the study quality assessment and extracted the results. A modified Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) scale was used to evaluate the scientific rigour of the selected works. Results: Twenty-four studies fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in the systematic review. We found conflicting data regarding the validity of methods used to examine back muscle fatigue. The Biering-Sorensen test, performed in conjunction with surface electromyography spectral analysis, turned out to be the most widely used and comparatively, the most optimal modality currently available to assess objective back muscle fatigue in daily clinical practise, even though critical limitations are discussed. Conclusions: Future research should address the identification of an advanced method for lower back fatigue assessment in patients with CNSLBP which, eventually, might provide physical therapists with an objective and reliable test usable in everyday clinical practise.Implications for Rehabilitation Despite its limitations, the Biering-Sorensen test is currently the most used, convenient and easily available fatiguing test for lumbar muscles. To increase validity and reliability of the Biering-Sorensen test, concomitant activation of synergistic muscles should be taken into account. Pooled mean frequency and half-width of the spectrum are currently the most valid electromyographic parameters to assess fatigue in chronic non-specific low back pain. Body mass index, grading of pain and level of disability of the study population should be reported to enhance research quality.

N2  - Background: The role played by the thoracolumbar fascia in chronic low back pain (LBP) is poorly understood. The thoracolumbar fascia is composed of dense connective tissue layers separated by layers of loose connective tissue that normally allow the dense layers to glide past one another during trunk motion. The goal of this study was to quantify shear plane motion within the thoracolumbar fascia using ultrasound elasticity imaging in human subjects with and without chronic low back pain (LBP). Methods. We tested 121 human subjects, 50 without LBP and 71 with LBP of greater than 12 months duration. In each subject, an ultrasound cine-recording was acquired on the right and left sides of the back during passive trunk flexion using a motorized articulated table with the hinge point of the table at L4-5 and the ultrasound probe located longitudinally 2 cm lateral to the midline at the level of the L2-3 interspace. Tissue displacement within the thoracolumbar fascia was calculated using cross correlation techniques and shear strain was derived from this displacement data. Additional measures included standard range of motion and physical performance evaluations as well as ultrasound measurement of perimuscular connective tissue thickness and echogenicity. Results: Thoracolumbar fascia shear strain was reduced in the LBP group compared with the No-LBP group (56.4% 3.1% vs. 70.2% 3.6% respectively, p <.01). There was no evidence that this difference was sex-specific (group by sex interaction p =.09), although overall, males had significantly lower shear strain than females (p =.02). Significant correlations were found in male subjects between thoracolumbar fascia shear strain and the following variables: perimuscular connective tissue thickness (r = -0.45, p <.001), echogenicity (r = -0.28, p <.05), trunk flexion range of motion (r = 0.36, p <.01), trunk extension range of motion (r = 0.41, p <.01), repeated forward bend task duration (r = -0.54, p <.0001) and repeated sit-to-stand task duration (r = -0.45, p <.001). Conclusion: Thoracolumbar fascia shear strain was ∼20% lower in human subjects with chronic low back pain. This reduction of shear plane motion may be due to abnormal trunk movement patterns and/or intrinsic connective tissue pathology. There appears to be some sex-related differences in thoracolumbar fascia shear strain that may also play a role in altered connective tissue function. © 2011Langevin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - This study sought to determine the effects of chronic low back pain (LBP) on the cortical evoked potentials, muscle activation, and kinematics of postural responses to perturbations of standing balance. Thirteen subjects with chronic, recurrent, non-specific LBP and 13 subjects without LBP participated. The subjects responded to unpredictably timed postural perturbations while standing on a platform that randomly rotated either “toes up” or “toes down”. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to calculate the negative peak (N1) and subsequent positive peak (P2) amplitudes of the perturbation-evoked cortical potentials. Passive-marker motion capture was used to calculate joint and center-of-mass (CoM) displacements. Surface electromyography was used to record muscle onset latencies. Questionnaires assessed pain, interference with activity, fear of activity, and pain catastrophizing. Results demonstrated that subjects with LBP exhibited significantly larger P2 potentials, delayed erector spinae, rectus abdominae, and external oblique onset latencies, as well as smaller trunk extension yet larger trunk flexion, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion displacements compared to subjects without LBP. For the subjects with LBP, CoM displacements significantly and positively correlated with knee displacements as well as activity interference and fear scores. The P2 potentials significantly and negatively correlated with CoM displacements as well as activity interference, catastrophizing, and fear scores. These results demonstrate that people with LBP exhibit altered late-phase cortical processing of postural perturbations concomitant with altered kinematic and muscle responses, and these cortical and postural response characteristics correlate with each other as well as with clinical reports of pain-related fears and activity interference.

N2  - Objective: To investigate impairment in the activity pattern of some muscles involved in sit to stand (STD) and stand to sit (STS) among 2 low back pain (LBP) subgroups of the Movement System Impairment (MSI) model. Design: Case-control study. Setting: A university medical center. Participants: Fifteen women without chronic LBP and 22 women with chronic LBP (N=37) in 2 subgroups (15 into the lumbar extension rotation (LER) and 7 into lumbar flexion rotation [LFR]) voluntarily participated in this study. Interventions: Participants were asked to perform STD and STS at a preferred speed. Surface electromyography (EMG) were measured bilaterally from the internal oblique (IO), lumbar erector spine (ES), medial hamstring (MH), and lateral hamstring (LH) muscles. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in mean and maximum amplitude, time to peak amplitude, duration of muscle activity, and bilateral asymmetry of these variables. Results: During STD, bilateral asymmetry in mean amplitude of MH in the LER subgroup (P=.031) and bilateral asymmetry in duration of LH in the LFR subgroup (P=.026) were exhibited. Also, in this task reduced time to peak left MH activation were found in the LFR subgroup than 2 other groups (control; P=.028/LER; P=.004). During STS, increased left ES maximum amplitude were observed in the LFR subgroup than LER subgroup (P=.029). Also, reduced time to peak right ES (P=.035) and left LH (P=.038) activation in the LER subgroup than control subjects and reduced time to peak left LH activation in LFR subgroup than control subjects (P=.041) were observed during STS. Conclusions: The differences between the 2 LBP subgroups may be a result of impairment in the activity pattern of some muscles during functional activity.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Incidence of Low Back Pain (LBP) in athletes is as high as 30%. Patients with LBP show altered postural and neuromuscular responses to various functional tasks. The objective of the study was to compare long latency reflex response (occurring between 40 to ∼ 100 ms duration) in athletes with chronic LBP with asymptomatic athletes. METHODS: Surface electromyography (EMG) of superficial trunk muscles-Rectus Abdominis (RA) and Erector Spinae (ES) were studied in athletes with chronic LBP (n=24) and asymptomatic athletes (n=25). Perturbations were introduced in standing both expectedly and unexpectedly. The latency of onset and the Root Mean Square (RMS) amplitudes within the reaction duration were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The latency of onset was delayed in Unexpected perturbations but no change was observed in Expected tasks. The mean RMS amplitudes were significantly lower in both tasks for RA and in the Expected task for ES (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Chronic LBP athletes exhibit a delay in onset latency to Unexpected perturbations and reduced long latency response amplitudes to perturbation tasks compared to asymptomatic athletes. These changes could predispose athletes to recurrent low back pain and further injury. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

N2  - Low back discomfort (LBD) is common in long-term standing work. The aim of this study was to investigate whether development of LBD during standing is related to lumbar muscle activity and pelvic movement. In a secondary analysis we investigated whether age, gender, and standing work habituation moderates the above-mentioned relationship. Sixty subjects (15 young females, 15 young males, 15 older males, and 15 young males habituated to standing work) were included and had to stand for 4.5 h over three periods with two seated breaks. Surface electromyography, a gravimetrical position sensor, and a numeric rating scale were used to assess lumbar muscle activity, pelvic movement, and LBD, respectively. 22 of 55 analyzed subjects (40%) reported LBD and were assigned to the discomfort developer (DD) group. The remaining subjects (non-discomfort developer: NoDD) showed a statistically significant increase of medio-lateral pelvic movement in the progression of the three standing periods. Almost no differences occurred in lumbar muscle activity (except for the 5th percentile of surface electromyography, which was higher in NoDD). No influence of age, gender, or standing habituation was found. Increased pelvic movement may protect from LBD development during prolonged standing, although differences are very small and clinical relevance is unclear.

N2  - Objectives: Despite the high prevalence of low back pain (LBP) in rowers, there are few studies investigating changes in lumbar muscle activation in rowers with a recent history of LBP. Such knowledge is relevant to understand potential mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and recurrence of LBP in rowers. For the first time, we evaluate the spatial distribution of erector spinae (ES) activity in rowers with and without a recent history of LBP, using a novel application of high-density surface electromyography (HDEMG). Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Asymptomatic rowers (N = 10) and rowers with a recent history of LBP (N = 8) performed 7 × 4-min exercise bouts (rowing ergometer) until volitional exhaustion. HDEMG signals were acquired bilaterally over the lumbar ES and the root mean square (RMS) amplitude and entropy were analyzed. In addition, the y-axis coordinate of the barycentre (RMS-map) was used to assess changes in ES spatial activation. Results: As the load increased, rowers with LBP showed higher amplitude (p < 0.01) and less complexity (entropy) of the HDEMG signals (p < 0.001). In addition, rowers with LBP showed opposite displacements of the barycentre, specifically showing a caudal shift of muscle activity at high intensities (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Both the magnitude of activation and distribution of ES activity were altered in rowers with a recent history of LBP. The lower complexity of signals together with the caudal displacements of the barycentre suggest an inefficient recruitment of the ES as the load progressed. Modification of the rowing technique in conjunction with feedback from HDEMG might prove useful in future studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Changes in the motor control of the spine were found in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Sudden loading of the spine is supposed to be the cause of about 12% of lower back injuries. However, some aspects of this problem, such as alterations in the sensory-motor control of the spine, remain questionable. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of familiarization with loading, weight and size of loading on neuromuscular responses during sudden upper limb loading in CLBP patients. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study surface electromyography of the erector spinae (ES) and transverses abdominis/internal oblique (TrA/IO) and external oblique (EOA) muscles were recorded in 7 men and 13 women with CLBP and 20 asymptomatic subjects (10 men and 10 women) aged 18-45 years from the general community familiarization. Moreover, investigating control of the posture measurements of the center of pressure (COP) and vertical ground reaction force (GRF) or Fz were recorded using a force plate. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test with the significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Data analyses were performed using SPSS version 18. Some electromyography and force plate variables were significantly different for different conditions in each group and between the asymptomatic and low back pain groups (≤ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Several motor control changes were observed in the CLBP patients. These patients showed decreased trunk muscle activity as well as too early and too delayed responses compared to asymptomatic subjects.

N2  - Previous studies have explored to saturation the efficacy of the conventional signal (such as electromyogram) for muscle function assessment and found its clinical impact limited. Increasing demand for reliable muscle function assessment modalities continues to prompt further investigation into other complementary alternatives. Application of mechanomyographic signal to quantify muscle performance has been proposed due to its inherent mechanical nature and ability to assess muscle function non-invasively while preserving muscular neurophysiologic information. Mechanomyogram is gaining accelerated applications in evaluating the properties of muscle under voluntary and evoked muscle contraction with prospects in clinical practices. As a complementary modality and the mechanical counterpart to electromyogram; mechanomyogram has gained significant acceptance in analysis of isometric and dynamic muscle actions. Substantial studies have also documented the effectiveness of mechanomyographic signal to assess muscle performance but none involved comprehensive appraisal of the state of the art applications with highlights on the future prospect and potential integration into the clinical practices. Motivated by the dearth of such critical review, we assessed the literature to investigate its principle of acquisition, current applications, challenges and future directions. Based on our findings, the importance of rigorous scientific and clinical validation of the signal is highlighted. It is also evident that as a robust complement to electromyogram, mechanomyographic signal may possess unprecedented potentials and further investigation will be enlightening. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: This study investigated whether laser displacement mechanomyography (MMG) could detect acute injury of low back muscles following strenuous eccentric exercise. Methods: Sixteen healthy adults (10 females, 6 males, mean ± standard deviation, age 21 ± 2.90 years, BMI 21.63 ± 1.99 kg/m 2 ), without low back pain or low back resistance training, were recruited. Strength [maximum voluntary isometric contraction force (MVC)], pain intensity [visual analogue scale (VAS)], biological markers of muscle injury (serum myoglobin and creatine kinase levels), and MMG-derived muscle contractile properties were measured at seven different time points. Pre-exercise ‘control’ measures were taken prior to a strenuous eccentric exercise task, followed by an immediate post-exercise measurement and further four consecutive daily measurements. A final post-exercise measurement was completed on day 12 post-exercise. Results: Compared to pre-exercise control, MVC was lower immediately post-exercise (day 1) and on days 2–3. VAS scores were higher post-exercise (day 1) and from days 2–5. Myoglobin was significantly higher on day 4, whilst creatine kinase was significantly higher on days 4–5. MMG-derived maximum muscle displacement (D max ) was significantly diminished post-exercise (day 1) at all vertebral segments (L1-MT), while contraction velocity (V c ) was significantly slower at all segments except sacral multifidus. V c recovered rapidly (by day 2), while mid-lumbar D max resolved on day 12. D max had moderate correlations with MVC (R = 0.61) and VAS (R = − 0.50), and low correlations with myoglobin (R = − 0.36). Conclusion: MMG appears capable of detecting changes in muscle contractile properties associated with an acute bout of low back pain.

N2  - This study aimed to investigate the spatial distribution and redistribution of lumbar erector spinae (ES) activity during a lumbar extension endurance task in pain-free participants and how this is modified in people with low back pain (LBP). High density surface electromyography (HDEMG) was recorded using 13 × 5 electrode grids placed over the lumbar ES in 13 LBP and 13 control participants while completing an Ito test to task failure. The root mean square of the HDEMG signals was computed, a topographical map of the EMG amplitude generated and the centre of the activity (centroid) determined throughout the task. The centroid of the EMG amplitude map was systematically more cranial (F = 6.09, P = 0.022) for the LBP participants compared with the control subjects. Regression analysis showed that the extent of redistribution of ES activity was associated with longer endurance. These results show that LBP participants utilised a different motor strategy to perform the endurance task, characterised by greater activation of more cranial regions of the ES and less redistribution of ES activity throughout the task. This study provides new insight into the functional activation of the lumbar ES and how it is modified when people have pain.

N2  - Background: The root mean square surface electromyographic activity of lumbar extensor muscles during dynamic trunk flexion and extension from standing has repeatedly been recommended to objectively assess muscle function in chronic low back pain patients. However, literature addressing older patients is sparse. This cross sectional study sought to examine differences in neuromuscular activation between age groups (>60 versus 40-60 versus <40 years) and sexes during a standardized trunk flexion-extension task. Methods: A total of 216 patients (62 older, 84 middle-aged, 70 younger) performed maximum trunk extensions followed by trunk flexion extension testing thereby holding static positions at standing, half, and full trunk flexion. The lumbar extensor muscle activity and 3d-accelerometric signals intended to monitor hip and trunk position angles were recorded from the L5 (multifidus) and T4 (semispinalis thoracis) levels. Permutation ANOVA with bootstrapped confidence intervals were performed to examine for age and gender related differences. Ridge-regressions investigated the impact of physical-functional and psychological variables to the half flexion relaxation ratio (i.e. muscle activity at the half divided by that in maximum flexion position). Results: Maximum back extension torque was slightly but significantly higher in youngest compared to oldest patients if male and females were pooled. Normalized RMS-SEMG revealed highest lumbar extensor muscle activity at standing in the oldest and the female groups. Patients over 60 years showed lowest activity changes from standing to half (increments) and from half to the maximum flexion position (decrements) leading to a significantly lower half flexion relaxation ratio compared to the youngest patients. These oldest patients demonstrated the highest hip and lowest lumbothoracic changes of position angles. Females had higher regional hip and gross trunk ranges of movement compared to males. Lumbothoracic flexion and the muscle activity at standing had a significant impact on the half flexion relaxation ratio. Conclusions: The neuromuscular activation pattern and the kinematics in this trunk flexion-extension task involving static half flexion position changed according to age and sex. The test has a good potential to discriminate between impaired and unimpaired neuromuscular regulation of back extensors in cLBP patients, thereby allowing the design of more individualized exercise programs.

N2  - Background: Postural control declines with age and can be affected by low back pain. Poor balance has been reported in people with chronic low back pain (CLBP), which in turn could be explained by the changes in trunk muscle activation. Research Question: Are there differences between younger and older adults with and without chronic low back pain (CLBP) on trunk muscle activity during one-legged stance task? Methods: Twenty (20) with, and 20 subjects without nonspecific CLBP participated in the study. Each group was comprised of 10 younger (50% males; mean age: 31 years) and 10 older adults (50% males; mean age: 71 years). Subjects performed 3 × 30-second trials of one-legged stance, with eyes open, on a force platform, while surface electromyography (EMG) measurements were obtained bilaterally on the multifidus at L5, iliocostalis lumborum at L3, rectus abdominis and biceps femoris muscles.EMG amplitude analysis was processed by the Root Mean Square (250 ms window epochs) and normalized by the peak of activation during the balance tasks, to determine the muscular activity of each muscle. Results: Participants with CLBP presented 15% lower lumbar muscle activation (p < 0.05), and 23% higher co-activation (ratio between rectus adominis by multifidus) than participants without CLBP, regardless of age. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between older and young groups were observed only for lower lumbar muscles (mean 24% lower in older than younger adults) and rectus adominis muscles (mean 17% lower in older than younger adults). Significance: CLBP individuals have different trunk muscle activity than those without CLBP, and older adults exhibit lower trunk activation during one-legged stance balance task. The use of the EMG in evaluation of trunk neuromuscular function during one-legged stance may thus be a valuable tool when assessing balance in CLBP and older people.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the chronic low back pain and coronary heart disease relationship, after adjusting for relevant confounders, including genetics. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, 2148 twins were recruited from the Murcia Twin Registry, Spain. The exposure was chronic LBP and the outcomes were myocardial infarction and other coronary heart diseases - lifetime and in the last 2 years-based on standardized health-related questionnaires. First, logistic regression analysis investigated associations of the total sample followed by a matched co-twin control analyses, with all complete twin pairs discordant for chronic LBP utilised, separated for zygosity - dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic (MZ) pairs, which adjusted for shared familial factors, including genetics. Results: Chronic LBP pain is associated with lifetime myocardial infarction [odds ratio (OR) = 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-5.36], other coronary heart diseases over a lifetime (OR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.69-3.93) and in the last two years (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.33-3.60), while there was a borderline association with myocardial infarction in the last 2 years (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 0.98-7.12). Although the magnitude of the association remained or increased in the co-twin control analyses, none reached statistical significance. Conclusion: Chronic LBP is associated with a higher prevalence of myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease. It is possible that this association remains even when controlling for genetics and early shared environment, although this should be investigated with larger samples of twins discordant for LBP.

N2  - Background: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) has been associated with altered trunk muscle responses as well as increased muscle fatigability. CLBP patients and fatigued healthy subjects could experience similar neuromuscular strategies to attempt to protect the spine. The current study examined muscle activation differences between healthy and CLBP subjects following a perturbation. In addition, the possible role of muscle fatigue was evaluated by investigating the healthy control subjects in a non-fatigued and a fatigued condition. Both experiments were combined to evaluate possible similar strategies between CLBP and fatigued samples. Methods: Cross-sectional study where 24 CLBP subjects and 26 healthy subjects were evaluated. Both groups (CLBP vs. healthy) and both conditions (non-fatigued and a fatigued condition) were evaluated while a weight was suddenly dropped on a held tray. Erector spinae, multifidus, obliques and biceps brachii were recorded using surface electromyography. Variables describing the bursts timing and variables describing the amount of muscle activity (number of bursts and amplitude increase) post impact were studied. The analysis between groups and conditions was carried out using ANOVAs with repeated measurements for the muscle factor. Results: CLBP subjects reacted similarly to healthy subjects regarding muscle activity post impact. However, the CLBP group showed temporal characteristics of muscle activity that were in between the fatigued and non-fatigued healthy group. Clear differences in muscle activity were displayed for healthy subjects. Fatigued healthy subjects presented more reduced activity after impact (upper limb and trunk muscles) than non-fatigued healthy subjects and different temporal characteristic in the same way than CLBP patients. This same temporal characteristic with CLBP and healthy fatigued people was a delay of the first burst of muscle activity after impact. Conclusion: Though similar muscle pattern existed between CLBP and healthy people, CLBP temporal characteristics of muscle activity showed a pattern in between healthy people and fatigued healthy people. While the temporal muscle pattern dysfunction used by CLBP subjects could be related to maladaptive patterns, temporal and muscle activity characteristics used by healthy fatigued people may lead to back injuries.

The abdominal strength and the strength of the spine extensor muscles were analyzed by an isometric test. Results: ThePearson correlation showed a highly significant negative correlation between the estradiol levels and the VAS (r =-0.725; p = 0.012). The cortisol presented a significant negative correlation with the strength scores of the spine extensors (r =-0.764; p = 0.006).The participants’ age presented significant correlation with cortisol (r =-0.668; p = 0.025) and with the lumbar score (r =-0.601; p = 0.051). No significant differences were found in RMQ, CK, and the abdominal score(p ≥ 0.05).Conclusions:Postmenopausal women with higher age tend to present higher serum cortisol levels and lower levels of lumbar strength.Moreover, greater levels of cortisol are related to smallerlevels of lumbar strength. Lower estradiol levels tend to represent higher pain perception in postmenopausal women withlow back pain.

N2  - Background: Low back pain and neck-shoulder pain are the most reported types of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, and performing heavy lifting at work and working with trunk rotation increase the risk of developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides information about the electrical activity of muscles. Thus it has the potential to retrieve indirect information about the physical exposure of specific muscles of workers during their actual work. This study aimed to investigate the inter-day reliability of absolute and normalized amplitude of sEMG measurements obtained during repeated standardized reference lifts. Methods: The inter-day reliability of sEMG of the erector spinae longissimus and trapezius descendens muscles was tested during standardized box lifts. The lifts were performed with loads of 3, 15 and 30 kg from floor to table and from table to table in three conditions, i.e., forearm length (short reaching distance), arm length (long reaching distance) and forearm length with trunk rotation. Absolute and normalized root mean square (absRMS and normRMS) values were extracted. In line with the guidelines for reporting reliability and agreement studies, we reported relative and absolute reliability estimated by intra class correlation (ICC3,K), standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change in percent (MDC). Results: The ICC3,K was higher for absRMS compared with normRMS while SEM and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) were similar. A total of 50 out of 56, i.e., 89%, and 41 out of 56, i.e., 73%, of the lifting situations were in the range from moderate to almost perfect for absRMS and normRMS, respectively. The SEM and MDC shoved more variation in the lifting situations performed from floor to table and in the trapezius descendens muscle than in the erector spinae longissimus muscle. Conclusion: This reliability study showed that maximum absRMS and normRMS were found to have a fair to substantial relative inter-day reliability for most lifts but were more reliable when lifting from table to table than from floor to table for both trapezius descendens and erector spinae muscles. The relative inter-day reliability was higher for absolute compared with normalized sEMG amplitudes while the absolute reliability was similar.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The optimum repetition number of standing back-extension exercise (SBEE) effective for the prevention and improvement of low back pain (LBP) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of physiotherapy on LBP by investigating the optimum repetition number of SBEE via optical analysis and electromyographic (EMG) examination of the multifidus muscles. METHODS: Hemodynamics and multifidus muscle activity were examined in 16 healthy adult men using near-infrared spectroscopy and surface EMG after performing repetitive SBEE. RESULTS: Oxidized hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) levels significantly increased in the second extension phase but decreased in the third and subsequent extension phases; deoxidized hemoglobin (deOxy-Hb) levels increased in the third and subsequent extension phases. In the standing phase, no significant difference was observed; in the third and subsequent phases, Oxy-Hb levels decreased and deOxy-Hb levels increased. Muscular activity significantly decreased in the second standing phase but increased in the third and subsequent phases. No significant difference was observed in the extension phase with respect to the number of SBEE repetitions performed. In healthy individuals, hemodynamics improved up to second repetition of SBEE; subsequent repetitions may decrease hemodynamics because of increased activity of the multifidus muscles. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy individuals, hemodynamics improved up to second repetition of SBEE.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Motor control dysfunction persisting during symptom remission in persons with recurrent low back pain (LBP) may contribute to the recurrence of pain. OBJECTIVES: To investigate trunk control in persons in remission from recurrent LBP and in back-healthy controls using a dynamic, internally driven balance task. No differences in task performance were expected between groups, but it was hypothesized that persons with recurrent LBP would exhibit greater trunk coupling, consistent with a trunk-stiffening strategy. METHODS: In this cross-sectional controlled laboratory study, persons with and without recurrent LBP (n = 19 per group) completed the balance-dexterity task, which involved balancing on one limb in standing while compressing an unstable spring with the other. Task performance measures included center-of-pressure velocity under the stance limb and vertical force variability under the spring. Trunk coupling was quantified with the coefficient of determination (R2) of an angle-angle plot of thorax-pelvis frontal plane motion. Fine-wire and surface electromyography captured activations of paraspinals and abdominals. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups for any task performance measure. The group in remission from recurrent LBP exhibited reduced trunk coupling, or more dissociated thorax and pelvis motion, compared to the healthy control group (P = .024). Trunk coupling in this group was associated moderately with the lumbar multifidusto-erector spinae activation ratio (r = 0.618, P = .006) and weakly with the internal oblique-toexternal oblique ratio (r = 0.476, P = .046). CONCLUSION: The balance-dexterity task is a submaximal, internally driven unstable balance task during which more dissociated trunk motion was observed in persons in remission from recurrent LBP. Findings underscore the task-dependent nature of trunk control research and assessment in persons with recurrent LBP.

N2  - Background - Low heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with a higher risk of death in patients with heart disease and in elderly subjects and with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the general population. Methods and Results - We studied the predictive value of HRV for CHD and death from several causes in a population study of 14672 men and women without CHD, aged 45 to 65, by using the case-cohort design. At baseline, in 1987 to 1989, 2-minute rhythm strips were recorded. Time-domain measures of HRV were determined in a random sample of 900 subjects, for all subjects with incident CHD (395 subjects), and for all deaths (443 subjects) that occurred through 1993. Relative rates of incident CHD and cause-specific death in tertiles of HRV were computed with Poisson regression for the case-cohort design. Subjects with low HRV had an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and an elevated risk of incident CHD and death. The increased risk of death could not be attributed to a specific cause and could not be explained by other risk factors. Conclusions - Low HRV was associated with increased risk of CHD and death from several causes. It is hypothesized that low HRV is a marker of less favorable heath.

N2  - Resting heart rate variability (HRV) is a potentially useful marker to consider for monitoring training status in athletes. However, traditional HRV data collection methodology requires a 5-min recording period preceded by a 5-min stabilization period. This lengthy process may limit HRV monitoring in the field due to time constraints and high compliance demands of athletes. Investigation into more practical methodology for HRV data acquisitions is required. The aim of this study was to determine the time course for stabilization of ECG-derived lnRMSSD from traditional HRV recordings. Ten-minute supine ECG measures were obtained in ten male and ten female collegiate cross-country athletes. The first 5 min for each ECG was separately analysed in successive 1-min intervals as follows: minutes 0–1 (lnRMSSD0–1), 1–2 (lnRMSSD1–2), 2–3 (lnRMSSD2–3), 3–4 (lnRMSSD3–4) and 4–5 (lnRMSSD4–5). Each 1-min lnRMSSD segment was then sequentially compared to lnRMSSD of the 5- to 10-min ECG segment, which was considered the criterion (lnRMSSDCriterion). There were no significant differences between each 1-min lnRMSSD segment and lnRMSSDCriterion, and the effect sizes were considered trivial (ES ranged from 0·07 to 0·12). In addition, the ICC for each 1-min segment compared to the criterion was near perfect (ICC values ranged from 0·92 to 0·97). The limits of agreement between the prerecording values and lnRMSSDCriterion ranged from ±0·28 to ±0·45 ms. These results lend support to shorter, more convenient ECG recording procedures for lnRMSSD assessment in athletes by reducing the prerecording stabilization period to 1 min.

N2  - Beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) dynamics were studied by plotting each R-R interval as a function of the previous R-R interval (Poincare plot) during incremental doses of atropine followed by exercise for 10 subjects and during exercise without autonomic blockade for 31 subjects. A quantitative two- dimensional vector analysis of a Poincare plot was used by measuring separately the standard deviation of instantaneous beat-to-beat R-R interval variability (SD1) and the standard deviation of continuous long-term R-R interval variability (SD2) as well as the SD1/SD2 ratio. Quantitative Poincare measures were compared with linear measures of HR variability (HRV) and with approximate entropy (ApEn) at rest and during exercise. A linear progressive reduction was observed in SD1 during atropine administration, and it remained almost at the zero level during exercise after a parasympathetic blockade. Atropine resulted in more variable changes in SD2 and the SD1/SD2 ratio, but during exercise after parasympathetic blockade, a progressive increase was observed in the SD1/SD2 ratio until the end of exercise. The SD1/SD2 ratio had no significant correlations with the frequency domain measures of HRV. However, the SD1/SD2 ratio had a modest correlation with ApEn at rest (r = -0.69, P < 0.001), but not during exercise (r = 0.27, P = NS). All measures of vagal modulation of HR decreased progressively until the ventilatory threshold level was reached, when sympathetic activation was reflected as changes in the SD1/SD2 ratio. These results show that quantitative two-dimensional vector analysis of a Poincare plot can provide useful information on vagal modulation of R-R interval dynamics during exercise that are not easily detected by linear summary measures of HRV or by ApEn.

N2  - Large individual differences in pain sensitivity present a challenge for medical diagnosis and may be of importance for the development of chronic pain. Variance in pain sensitivity is partially mediated by genetic factors, but the extent of this contribution is uncertain. We examined cold-pressor pain and contact heat pain in 53 identical (MZ) and 39 fraternal (DZ) twin pairs, and 4 single twins to determine the heritability of the two phenotypes, and the extent to which the same genetic and environmental factors affect both pain modalities. An estimated 60% of the variance in cold-pressor pain and 26% of the variance in heat pain was genetically mediated. Genetic and environmental factors were only moderately correlated across pain modalities. Genetic factors common to both modalities explained 7% of the variance in cold-pressor and 3% of the variance in heat pain. Environmental factors common to both modalities explained 5% of variance in cold-pressor and 8% of the variance in heat pain. The remaining variance was due to factors that were specific to each pain modality. These findings demonstrate that cold-pressor pain and contact heat pain are mainly distinct phenomena from both a genetic and an environmental standpoint. This may partly explain disparate results in genetic association studies and argues for caution in generalizing genetic findings from one pain modality to another. It also indicates that differences in pain scale usage account for a minor portion of the variance, providing strong support for the validity of subjective pain ratings as measures of experienced pain. © 2007 International Association for the Study of Pain.

N2  - Central sensitization (CS) is a proposed physiological phenomenon in which central nervous system neurons become hyperexcitable, resulting in hypersensitivity to both noxious and non-noxious stimuli. The term central sensitivity syndrome (CSS) describes a group of medically indistinct (or nonspecific) disorders, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome, for which CS may be a common etiology. In a previous study, the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) was introduced as a screening instrument for clinicians to help identify patients with a CSS. It was found to have high reliability and validity (test-retest reliability = .82; Cronbach's alpha = .88). The present study investigated a cohort of 121 patients who were referred to a multidisciplinary pain center, which specializes in the assessment and treatment of complex pain and psychophysiological disorders, including CSSs. A large percentage of patients (n = 89, 74%) met clinical criteria for one or more CSSs, and CSI scores were positively correlated with the number of diagnosed CSSs. A receiver operating characteristic analysis determined that a CSI score of 40 out of 100 best distinguished between the CSS patient group and a nonpatient comparison sample (N = 129) (area under the curve = .86, sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 75%). Perspective: The CSI is a new self-report screening instrument to help identify patients with CSSs, including fibromyalgia. The present study investigated CSI scores in a heterogeneous pain population with a large percentage of CSSs, and a normative nonclinical sample to determine a clinically relevant cutoff value. © 2013 by the American Pain Society.

N2  - Background: Algometry has been shown to be an effective way of quantifying pressure pain threshold (PPT), although its reliability in assessing spinal muscle pain (excluding trigger points) has not been robustly analysed. Objectives: Intra-rater PPT assessment by algometry over the belly of four pairs of spinal muscles (iliocostalis, multifidus, gluteus maximus and trapezius) in a healthy sample was analysed. Methods: Healthy subjects had their PPT measured twice (within 5 min) on three occasions (separated by a week). Intra-class correlation coefficients and the smallest detectable difference were calculated to analyse the reliability of the measurements and 95% limits of agreement plots were drawn to assess systematic difference. Results: Assessments revealed good within-session reliability (80 assessments) (ICC > 0.91) and good between-session reliability (ICC > 0.87), with a moderate measurement error (approximately 3 kg/cm2) and no systematic difference within-session or between-sessions. Conclusions: PPT assessment by algometry is a reliable, both within-session and between-sessions, measure of a subject's pain. This study provides further validity to the use of this measure as a suitable, convenient method of monitoring treatment effects. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The pressure pain threshold (PPT), i.e. the least stimulus intensity at which a subject perceives pain, was studied in 30 patients with chronic unilateral pain in the shoulder and arm region. Fourteen trigger points were investigated on both sides of the body using pressure algometry. Eight paravertebral points and six points in the shoulder and arm region were evaluated. Each location was examined twice. The patients were tested by one examiner. The intraobserver reliability of PPT measurements was considered to be good. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of reliability (ICC), based on two repeated PPT measurements varied between 0.64 and 0.96. The painful side of the body was found to be more sensitive than the non-painful side, although there was not always a significant difference at the 0.05 level. The PPT was found to be higher in males than in females (P < 0.05). Females demonstrated lower PPTs than males at each trigger point. It was established that pressure tenderness varies over individual trigger points. Significant regional differences in PPT values were observed (P < 0.05). PPT values decreased in a cranial direction in the spine and in a caudal direction in the upper limb. Although the authors expected to find segmentally reduced PPT values on the painful side of the body, a generalized reduction of PPT values was present at all peripheral and spinal segmental sites. Some correlations between segmentally related trigger points were found by factor analysis.

N2  - Pressure threshold is the minimal pressure (force) which induces pain. The pressure threshold meter (PTM) is a force gauge with a rubber disc of 1 cm2 surface. The instrument has been proven to be useful in clinical practice for quantification of deep muscle tenderness. Trigger points, fibrositis, myalgic spots, activity of arthritis as well as assessment of sensitivity to pain can be diagnosed by PTM. This study therefore established standards for pressure threshold as well as the reproducibility and validity of measurement in 24 male and 26 female normal volunteers at 9 sites. Muscles frequently afflicted by trigger points were examined. The deltoid was chosen as a reference since it is rarely a site for trigger points. Comparison of corresponding muscles on opposite sides failed to demonstrate significant differences (except for 1 muscle in females). These identical results obtained over muscles of opposite sides proved the excellent reproducibility and validity of pressure threshold measurement. Results serve as a reference for clinical diagnosis of abnormal tenderness and for documentation of treatment results. The sensitivity of individual muscles varies. Therefore the results presented should be kept in mind when diagnosis of pathological tenderness by palpation is attempted. © 1987.

N2  - Aims: To test in vitro and in vivo the reliability and accuracy of a new algometer, the pressure algometer for palpation (PAP), for measuring pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) and to compare its features with those of a commercially available pressure algometer. Methods: For in vitro accuracy testing, 6 repeated measurements were made at 8 defined test weights from 0.5 to 5 lb. In vivo validity testing compared the PAP to a standard instrument, the hand-held Somedic algometer, at 16 sites including the masticatory muscles, the temporomandibular joints, and the frontalis (as the control site) in 15 temporomandibular disorder (TMD) cases and 15 controls. Intraexaminer reliability was also assessed for both algometers. Results: In vitro reliability was high, with coefficients of variation of < 5% and a single-measurement standard deviation of 2.1 kPa. Accuracy was also high, with PAP measurements correlating with test weights at r = .99 (P < .001). Repeated measures reliability in vivo was high, with intraclass correlation estimates of 0.73 to 0.96 for the PAP and 0.78 to 0.99 for the Somedic algometer. PPT values correlated moderately between the 2 devices (r ranged from 0.38 to 0.66; P ≤.05) and were consistently higher for the PAP at all sites P < .001). Differences between controls and TMD cases were also significant for both algometers (P < .006). Conclusion: Both the PAP and the Somedic algometer showed high reliability. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by statistically significant correlations between the devices. Both showed equally high capacity for differentiating TMD cases from controls. The PAP yielded significantly higher PPTs than the Somedic algometer. J OROFAC PAIN 2007;21:29-38.

N2  - A systematic review was conducted to identify and summarize the available scientific literature addressing pressure pain threshold (PPT) values over the temporalis, masseter, and frontalis muscles in healthy humans, patients with tension-type headache (TTH), and those with migraine both in males and females. Six relevant medical databases for the literature search were included: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, CINAHL, BioMed Central, and Embase. The search strategy was performed applying 15 keywords (eg, pressure pain threshold, temporalis muscle, tension type headache, pressure algometer) and their combinations. A total of 156 articles were identified, and 40 relevant articles were included. The main outcomes of the systematic review were extracted, and it was demonstrated that the PPT values in general were lower in patients compared with healthy subjects, and this was especially noted for temporalis in both females (migraine: 231.2±38.3 kPa<TTH: 248.4±39.3 kPa < healthy: 282.1±70.8 kPa) and males (migraine: 225.5 ± 61.2 kPa < TTH: 264.2 ± 32.5 kPa < healthy: 314.8 ± 63.3 kPa). The masseter muscle seemed to be more sensitive than the other 2 muscles, in both females (healthy: masseter 194.1 ± 62.7 kPa < frontalis 277.5 ± 51.1 kPa < temporalis 282.1 ± 70.8 kPa) and males (healthy: masseter 248.2 ± 48.4 kPa < temporalis 314.8 ± 63.3 < frontalis 388 kPa). Females had lower PPT values than those of males in temporalis, masseter, and frontalis muscles. This work is the first to systematically review the scientific literature addressing PPT values over craniofacial muscles of healthy subjects, patients with TTH, and those with migraine to provide the PPT value ranges. Based on these findings, a set of guidelines was established to assist future studies including PPT assessments over craniofacial muscles.

N2  - Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances. Keywords:

N2  - Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is an instrument to assess positive and negative sensory signs, helping to identify mechanisms underlying pathologic pain conditions. In this study, we evaluated the test-retest reliability (TR-R) and the interobserver reliability (IO-R) of QST in patients with sensory disturbances of different etiologies. In 4 centres, 60 patients (37 male and 23 female, 56.4 ± 1.9 years) with lesions or diseases of the somatosensory system were included. QST comprised 13 parameters including detection and pain thresholds for thermal and mechanical stimuli. QST was performed in the clinically most affected test area and a less or unaffected control area in a morning and an afternoon session on 2 consecutive days by examiner pairs (4 QSTs/patient). For both, TR-R and IO-R, there were high correlations (r = 0.80-0.93) at the affected test area, except for wind-up ratio (TR-R: r = 0.67; IO-R: r = 0.56) and paradoxical heat sensations (TR-R: r = 0.35; IO-R: r = 0.44). Mean IO-R (r = 0.83, 31% unexplained variance) was slightly lower than TR-R (r = 0.86, 26% unexplained variance, P < .05); the difference in variance amounted to 5%. There were no differences between study centres. In a subgroup with an unaffected control area (n = 43), reliabilities were significantly better in the test area (TR-R: r = 0.86; IO-R: r = 0.83) than in the control area (TR-R: r = 0.79; IO-R: r = 0.71, each P < .01), suggesting that disease-related systematic variance enhances reliability of QST. We conclude that standardized QST performed by trained examiners is a valuable diagnostic instrument with good test-retest and interobserver reliability within 2 days. With standardized training, observer bias is much lower than random variance. Quantitative sensory testing performed by trained examiners is a valuable diagnostic instrument with good interobserver and test-retest reliability for use in patients with sensory disturbances of different etiologies to help identify mechanisms of neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain. © 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Degenerative changes are commonly found in spine imaging but often occur in pain-free individuals as well as those with back pain. We sought to estimate the prevalence, by age, of common degenerative spine conditions by performing a systematic review studying the prevalence of spine degeneration on imaging in asymptomatic individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of articles reporting the prevalence of imaging findings (CT or MR imaging) in asymptomatic individuals from published English literature through April 2014. Two reviewers evaluated each manuscript. We selected age groupings by decade (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years), determining age-specific prevalence estimates. For each imaging finding, we fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model for the age-specific prevalence estimate clustering in the study, adjusting for the midpoint of the reported age interval. RESULTS: Thirty-three articles reporting imaging findings for 3110 asymptomatic individuals met our study inclusion criteria. The prevalence of disk degeneration in asymptomatic individuals increased from 37% of 20-year-old individuals to 96% of 80-year-old individuals. Disk bulge prevalence increased from 30% of those 20 years of age to 84% of those 80 years of age. Disk protrusion prevalence increased from 29% of those 20 years of age to 43% of those 80 years of age. The prevalence of annular fissure increased from 19% of those 20 years of age to 29% of those 80 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging findings of spine degeneration are present in high proportions of asymptomatic individuals, increasing with age. Many imaging-based degenerative features are likely part of normal aging and unassociated with pain. These imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition.

N2  - Although self-report pain ratings are the gold standard in clinical pain assessment, they are inherently subjective in nature and significantly influenced by multidimensional contextual variables. Although objective biomarkers for pain could substantially aid pain diagnosis and development of novel therapies, reliable markers for clinical pain have been elusive. In this study, individualized physical maneuvers were used to exacerbate clinical pain in patients with chronic low back pain (N = 53), thereby experimentally producing lower and higher pain states. Multivariate machine-learning models were then built from brain imaging (resting-state blood-oxygenation-level-dependent and arterial spin labeling functional imaging) and autonomic activity (heart rate variability) features to predict within-patient clinical pain intensity states (ie, lower vs higher pain) and were then applied to predict between-patient clinical pain ratings with independent training and testing data sets. Within-patient classification between lower and higher clinical pain intensity states showed best performance (accuracy = 92.45%, area under the curve = 0.97) when all 3 multimodal parameters were combined. Between-patient prediction of clinical pain intensity using independent training and testing data sets also demonstrated significant prediction across pain ratings using the combined model (Pearson's r = 0.63). Classification of increased pain was weighted by elevated cerebral blood flow in the thalamus, and prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, and increased primary somatosensory connectivity to frontoinsular cortex. Our machine-learning approach introduces a model with putative biomarkers for clinical pain and multiple clinical applications alongside self-report, from pain assessment in noncommunicative patients to identification of objective pain endophenotypes that can be used in future longitudinal research aimed at discovery of new approaches to combat chronic pain.

N2  - Purpose Over 20 years ago the term non-specific low back pain became popular to convey the limitations of our knowledge of the pathological source of most people's low back pain. Knowledge of underlying pathology has advanced little since then, despite limited improvements in outcomes for patients with low back pain. Methods This paper discusses potential misunderstandings related to diagnostic studies in the field of low back pain and argues that future diagnostic studies should include and investigate pathological sources of low back pain. Results Six potential misunderstandings are discussed. (1) Until diagnosis is shown to improve outcomes it is not worth investigating; (2) without a gold standard it is not possible to investigate diagnosis of low back pain; (3) the presence of pathology in some people without low back pain means it is not important; (4) dismissal of the ability to diagnose low back pain in clinical guidelines is supported by the same level of evidence as recommendations for therapy; (5) suggesting use of a diagnostic test in research is misinterpreted as endorsing its use in current clinical practice; (6) we seem to have forgotten the 'bio' in biopsychosocial low back pain. Conclusions We believe the misunderstandings presented in this paper partly explain the lack of investigation into pathology as an important component of the low back pain experience. A better understanding of the biological component of low back pain in relation, and in addition, to psychosocial factors is important for a more rational approach to management of low back pain. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Back pain remains a challenge for primary care internationally. One model that has not been tested is stratification of the management according to the patient's prognosis (low, medium, or high risk). We compared the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stratified primary care (intervention) with non-stratified current best practice (control). 1573 adults (aged ≥18 years) with back pain (with or without radiculopathy) consultations at ten general practices in England responded to invitations to attend an assessment clinic. Eligible participants were randomly assigned by use of computer-generated stratified blocks with a 2:1 ratio to intervention or control group. Primary outcome was the effect of treatment on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at 12 months. In the economic evaluation, we focused on estimating incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health-care costs related to back pain. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN37113406. 851 patients were assigned to the intervention (n=568) and control groups (n=283). Overall, adjusted mean changes in RMDQ scores were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group at 4 months (4·7 [SD 5·9] vs 3·0 [5·9], between-group difference 1·81 [95 CI 1·06- 2·57]) and at 12 months (4·3 [6·4] vs 3·3 [6·2], 1·06 [0·25-1·86]), equating to effect sizes of 0·32 (0·19-0·45) and 0·19 (0·04- 0·33), respectively. At 12 months, stratified care was associated with a mean increase in generic health benefit (0·039 additional QALYs) and cost savings (£240·01 vs £274·40) compared with the control group. The results show that a stratified approach, by use of prognostic screening with matched pathways, will have important implications for the future management of back pain in primary care.

N2  - Background: Although low-back pain is a highly prevalent condition, its clinical course remains uncertain. Our main objective was to systematically review the literature on the clinical course of pain and disability in patients with acute and persistent low-back pain. Our secondary objective was to investigate whether pain and disability have similar courses. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of inception cohort studies. We identified eligible studies by searching MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. We included prospective studies that enrolled an episode-inception cohort of patients with acute or persistent low-back pain and that measured pain, disability or recovery. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodologic quality. We used mixed models to determine pooled estimates of pain and disability over time. Results: Data from 33 discrete cohorts (11 166 participants) were included in the review. The variance-weighted mean pain score (out of a maximum score of 100) was 52 (95% CI 48-57) at baseline, 23 (95% CI 21-25) at 6 weeks, 12 (95% CI 9-15) at 26 weeks and 6 (95% CI 3- 10) at 52 weeks after the onset of pain for cohorts with acute pain. Among cohorts with persistent pain, the variance-weighted mean pain score (out of 100) was 51 (95% CI 44-59) at baseline, 33 (95% CI 29-38) at 6 weeks, 26 (95% CI 20-33) at 26 weeks and 23 (95% CI 16-30) at 52 weeks after the onset of pain. The course of disability outcomes was similar to the time course of pain outcomes in the acute pain cohorts, but the pain outcomes were slightly worse than disability outcomes in the persistent pain cohorts. Interpretation: Patients who presented with acute or persistent low-back pain improved markedly in the first six weeks. After that time improvement slowed. Low to moderate levels of pain and disability were still present at one year, especially in the cohorts with persistent pain. © 2012 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.

N2  - Background: Placebo treatments have been reported to help patients with many diseases, but the quality of the evidence supporting this finding has not been rigorously evaluated. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials in which patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or no treatment. A placebo could be pharmacologic (e.g., a tablet), physical (e.g., a manipulation), or psychological (e.g., a conversation). Results: We identified 130 trials that met our inclusion criteria. After the exclusion of 16 trials without relevant data on outcomes, there were 32 with binary outcomes (involving 3795 patients, with a median of 51 patients per trial) and 82 with continuous outcomes (involving 4730 patients, with a median of 27 patients per trial). As compared with no treatment, placebo had no significant effect on binary outcomes, regardless of whether these outcomes were subjective or objective. For the trials with continuous outcomes, placebo had a beneficial effect, but the effect decreased with increasing sample size, indicating a possible bias related to the effects of small trials. The pooled standardized mean difference was significant for the trials with subjective outcomes but not for those with objective outcomes. In 27 trials involving the treatment of pain, placebo had a beneficial effect, as indicated by a reduction in the intensity of pain of 6.5 mm on a 100-mm visual-analogue scale. Conclusions: We found little evidence in general that placebos had powerful clinical effects. Although placebos had no significant effects on objective or binary outcomes, they had possible small benefits in studies with continuous subjective outcomes and for the treatment of pain. Outside the setting of clinical trials, there is no justification for the use of placebos. Copyright © 2001 Massachusetts Medical Society.

N2  - Background: Interventions for low back pain (LBP) commonly target 'dysfunctional' or atypical lumbo-pelvic kinematics in the belief that correcting aberrant movement improves patients' pain and activity outcomes. If atypical kinematic parameters and postures have a relationship to LBP, they could be expected to more prevalent in people with LBP compared to people without LBP (NoLBP). This exploratory study measured, defined and compared atypical kinematic parameters in people with and without LBP. Methods: Wireless inertial motion and EMG sensors were used to measure lumbo-pelvic kinematics during standing trunk flexion (range of motion (ROM), timing, sequence coordination, and extensor muscle activation) and in sitting (relative sitting position, pelvic tilt range) in a sample of 126 of adults without LBP and 140 chronic LBP subjects. Atypical movement was defined using the 10th/90th centiles of the NoLBP group. Mean differences and prevalence rates for atypical movement were calculated. Dichotomised pain scores for 'high-pain-on-bending' and 'high-pain-on-sitting' were tested for their association with atypical kinematic variables. Results: For standing flexion, significant mean differences, after adjusting for age and gender factors, were seen for the LBP group with (i) reduced ROM (trunk flexion (NoLBP 111 o , LBP 93 o , p <.0001), lumbar flexion (NoLBP 52 o , LBP 46 o , p <.0001), pelvic flexion (NoLBP 59 o , LBP 48 o , p <.0001), (ii) greater extensor muscle activation for the LBP group (NoLBP 0.012, LBP 0.25 p <.0001), (iii) a greater delay in pelvic motion at the onset of flexion (NoLBP - 0.21 s; LBP - 0.36 s, p = 0.023), (iv) and longer movement duration for the LBP group (NoLBP 2.28 s; LBP 3.18 s, p <.0001). Atypical movement was significantly more prevalent in the LBP group for small trunk (× 5.4), lumbar (× 3.0) and pelvic ROM (× 3.9), low FRR (× 4.9), delayed pelvic motion at 20 o flexion (× 2.9), and longer movement duration (× 4.7). No differences between groups were seen for any sitting parameters. High pain intensity was significantly associated with small lumbar ROM and pelvic ROM. Conclusion: Significant movement differences during flexion were seen in people with LBP, with a higher prevalence of small ROM, slower movement, delayed pelvic movement and greater lumbar extensor muscle activation but without differences for any sitting parameter.

N2  - Low back pain is a very common symptom. It occurs in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries and all age groups from children to the elderly population. Globally, years lived with disability caused by low back pain increased by 54% between 1990 and 2015, mainly because of population increase and ageing, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. Low back pain is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. For nearly all people with low back pain, it is not possible to identify a specific nociceptive cause. Only a small proportion of people have a well understood pathological cause—eg, a vertebral fracture, malignancy, or infection. People with physically demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at greatest risk of reporting low back pain. Disabling low back pain is over-represented among people with low socioeconomic status. Most people with new episodes of low back pain recover quickly; however, recurrence is common and in a small proportion of people, low back pain becomes persistent and disabling. Initial high pain intensity, psychological distress, and accompanying pain at multiple body sites increases the risk of persistent disabling low back pain. Increasing evidence shows that central pain-modulating mechanisms and pain cognitions have important roles in the development of persistent disabling low back pain. Cost, health-care use, and disability from low back pain vary substantially between countries and are influenced by local culture and social systems, as well as by beliefs about cause and effect. Disability and costs attributed to low back pain are projected to increase in coming decades, in particular in low-income and middle-income countries, where health and other systems are often fragile and not equipped to cope with this growing burden. Intensified research efforts and global initiatives are clearly needed to address the burden of low back pain as a public health problem.

N2  - Background: This study aimed to quantify the effect of spinal manipulative treatment (SMT) from an analysis of baroreflex, systolic blood pressure and heart rate variability (HRV) on patients with acute back pain. It was hypothesized that SMT would increase the parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic control. Methods: Twenty-two patients with acute back pain were randomly divided into two groups: one receiving sham treatment (Sham) and the other receiving SMT. Recordings were completed during the first day and the seventh day, immediately before and after treatment on both days. ECG and systolic blood pressure were continuously recorded to compute cardiovascular variability and baroreflex sensitivity components. The perceived level of pain was measured with the numeric pain scale (NPS) 48 h before, just before and just after each treatment. The NPS ranged from 0 to 100% (peak of pain before treatment). ECG and systolic blood pressure recordings were analyzed in time frequency domain using the Smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution. Results: Root mean square of the successive differences, high frequency power of the heart rate variability high frequency baroreflex sensitivity differences between post and pre tests were higher in the SMT group than in the Sham group (p < 0.01), whereas no differences were observed with the other heart rate variability components. Also, no differences were observed with the systolic blood pressure components. Although the estimated pain scale values decreased over time, no difference was observed between the SMT and Sham groups. Conclusions: This seems to be the first study to assess the effect of SMT on both heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity in patients with acute back pain. SMT can be seen to provoke an increase in parasympathetic control known to relate to a person's healthy state. Thus, cardiovascular variability analysis may be a useful tool for clinicians to quantify and objectify the beneficial effects of spinal manipulation treatment.

N2  - Pain is conventionally viewed as a pattern of convergent activity within the somatosensory system that represents the exteroceptive sense of touch. Accumulating functional, anatomical and imaging findings indicate that pain is generated by specific sensory channels that ascend in a central homeostatic afferent pathway. Phylogenetically new thalamocortical projections in primates provide a sensory image of the physiological condition of the body and, in addition, direct activation of limbic motor cortex. These findings indicate that the human feeling of pain is both a distinct sensation and a motivation - that is, a specific emotion that reflects homeostatic behavioral drive, similar to temperature, itch, hunger and thirst.

N2  - Study Design.Systematic review.Objective.To summarize the evidence of neurophysiological effects of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) with a high velocity low amplitude thrust (HVLA-SMT) in asymptomatic and symptomatic humans.Summary of Background Data.HVLA-SMT is effective in reducing back pain, but its mode of action is not fully understood.Methods.A systematic literature search (until July 2018) was conducted by a professional librarian in seven databases (Medline (OvidSP), Premedline (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, PEDro, and Scopus). Two authors selected the studies according to the a priori described criteria and scored study quality. Only controlled studies of at least moderate quality were included. Effects of HVLA-SMT on a particular outcome measure were defined as more than one study showing a significantly greater effect of HVLA-SMT compared with the control intervention.Results.From the 18 studies included (932 participants in total), there was evidence only for an association between HVLA-SMT and changes in the autonomic nervous system, reflected in changes in heart rate variability and skin conductance. Most studies focused on healthy volunteers and none related neurophysiologic changes to pain reduction.Conclusion.This systematic review points to HVLA-SMT affecting the autonomic nervous system. The effects seem to depend on the spinal level of HVLA-SMT application and might differ between healthy volunteers and pain patients. There is a need for high-quality studies that include patients, well characterized for pain duration and outcome measure baseline values, and address the relation between changes in neurophysiology and pain.Level of Evidence: 2.

N2  - Background: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is characterized by an alteration in pain processing by the central nervous system that may affect autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance. Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic ANS activation. In particular, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) solely reflects parasympathetic input and is reduced in CLBP patients. Yet, it remains unknown if non-invasive brain stimulation can alter ANS balance in CLBP patients. Objective: To evaluate if non-invasive brain stimulation modulates the ANS, we analyzed HRV metrics collected in a previously published study of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) for the modulation of CLBP through enhancing alpha oscillations. We hypothesized that tACS would increase RSA. Methods: A randomized, crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study was conducted to investigate the effects of 10Hz-tACS on metrics of ANS balance calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG data were collected for 2 mins before and after 40 mins of 10Hz-tACS or sham stimulation. Results: There were no significant changes in RSA or other frequency-domain HRV components from 10Hz-tACS. However, exploratory time-domain HRV analyses revealed a significant increase in the standard deviation of normal intervals between R-peaks (SDNN), a measure of ANS balance, for 10Hz-tACS relative to sham. Conclusion: Although tACS did not significantly increase RSA, we found in an exploratory analysis that tACS modulated an integrated HRV measure of both ANS branches. These findings support the further study of how the ANS and alpha oscillations interact and are modulated by tACS.

N2  - Chromosome 15q11q13 is among the least stable regions in the genome due to its highly complex genomic architecture. Low copy repeat elements at 15q13.3 facilitate recurrent copy number variants (CNVs), with deletions established as pathogenic and CHRN CHRN A7 implicated as a candidate gene. However, the pathogenicity of duplications of A7 is unclear, as they are also found in reportedly healthy parents and unaffected control individuals. We evaluated 18 children with microduplications involving CHRN A7 identified by clinical chromosome microarray analysis (CMA). Comprehensive phenotyping revealed high prevalence of developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. As duplications are the most common CNVs identified by clinical CMA, this study provides CHRN A7 anticipatory guidance for those involved with care of affected individuals. Keywords

N2  - Despite ‘abnormal’ motion being considered a risk factor for low back injury, the current understanding of ‘normal’ spine motion is limited. Identifying normal motion within an individual is complicated by the considerable variation in movement patterns amongst healthy individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize sources of variation in spine motion among a sample of healthy participants. The second objective of this study was to develop a multivariate model capable of predicting an expected movement pattern for an individual. The kinematic shape of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine was recorded during a constrained dynamic trunk flexion movement; as this is not a normal everyday movement task, movements are considered ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ for this task rather than ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’. Variations in neutral standing posture accounted for 85% of the variation in spine motion throughout the task. Differences in total spine range of flexion and a regional re-weighting of range of motion between lower thoracic and lumbar regions explained a further 9% of the variance among individuals. The analysis also highlighted a difference in temporal sequencing of motion between lower thoracic and lumbar regions which explained 2% of the total movement variation. These identified sources of variation were used to select independent variables for a multivariate linear model capable of predicting an individuals’ expected movement pattern. This was done as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how the error between predicted and observed motion patterns could be used to differentiate between ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ movement strategies.

N2  - The aims of the study were to evaluate the relative and absolute variability of upper (T11-L2) and lower (L2-S2) lumbar spinal alignment in power- and weightlifters during the deadlift and back squat exercises, and to compare this alignment between the two lifting groups. Twenty-four competitive powerlifters (n = 14) and weightlifters (n = 10) performed three repetitions of the deadlift and the back squat exercises using a load equivalent to 70% of their respective one-repetition maximum. The main outcome measures were the three-dimensional lumbar spinal alignment for start position, minimum and maximum angle of their spinal alignment, and range of motion measured using inertial measurement units. Relative intra-trial reliability was calculated using the two-way random model intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and absolute reliability with minimal detectable change (MDC). The ICC ranged between 0.69 and 0.99 and the MDC between 1°-8° for the deadlift. Corresponding figures for the squat were 0.78–0.99 and 1°-6°. In all participants during both exercises, spinal adjustments were made in both thoracolumbar and lumbopelvic areas in all three dimensions. In conclusion, when performing three repetitions of the deadlift and the squat, lumbar spinal alignment of the lifters did not change much between repetitions and did not differ significantly between power- and weightlifters.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment contained in current clinical practice guidelines for patients with non-specific low back pain in primary care. We also aimed to examine how recommendations have changed since our last overview in 2010. Method: The searches for clinical practice guidelines were performed for the period from 2008 to 2017 in electronic databases. Guidelines including information regarding either the diagnosis or treatment of non-specific low back pain, and targeted at a multidisciplinary audience in the primary care setting, were considered eligible. We extracted data regarding recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, and methods for development of guidelines. Results: We identified 15 clinical practice guidelines for the management of low back pain in primary care. For diagnosis of patients with non-specific low back pain, the clinical practice guidelines recommend history taking and physical examination to identify red flags, neurological testing to identify radicular syndrome, use of imaging if serious pathology is suspected (but discourage routine use), and assessment of psychosocial factors. For treatment of patients with acute low back pain, the guidelines recommend reassurance on the favourable prognosis and advice on returning to normal activities, avoiding bed rest, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and weak opioids for short periods. For treatment of patients with chronic low back pain, the guidelines recommend the use of NSAIDs and antidepressants, exercise therapy, and psychosocial interventions. In addition, referral to a specialist is recommended in case of suspicion of specific pathologies or radiculopathy or if there is no improvement after 4 weeks. While there were a few discrepancies across the current clinical practice guidelines, a substantial proportion of recommendations was consistently endorsed. In the current review, we identified some differences compared to the previous overview regarding the recommendations for assessment of psychosocial factors, the use of some medications (e.g., paracetamol) as well as an increasing amount of information regarding the types of exercise, mode of delivery, acupuncture, herbal medicines, and invasive treatments.

N2  - Background Context: Low back pain (LBP) is a multifactorial problem with complex interactions among many biological, psychological and social factors. It is difficult to fully appreciate this complexity because the knowledge necessary to do so is distributed over many areas of expertise that span the biopsychosocial domains. Purpose: This study describes the collaborative modeling process, undertaken among a group of participants with diverse expertise in LBP, to build a model to enhance understanding and communicate the complexity of the LBP problem. Study Design: The study involved generating individual models that represented participants’ understanding of the LBP problem using fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), and 4 subsequent phases of consultation and consensus with the participants to characterize and refine the interpretation of the FCMs. Methods: The phases consisted of: proposal of Categories for clustering of model Components; preliminary evaluation of structure, composition and focal areas of participant's FCMs; refinement of Categories and Components with consensus meeting; generation of final structure and composition of individual participant's FCMs. Descriptive statistics were applied to the structural and composition metrics of individual FCMs to aid interpretation. Results: From 38 invited contributors, 29 (76%) agreed to participate. They represented 9 disciplines and 8 countries. Participants’ models included 729 Components, with an average of 25 (SD = 7) per model. After the final FCM refinement process (Components from separate FCMs that used similar terms were combined, and Components from an FCM that included multiple terms were separated), there were 147 Components allocated to ten Categories. Although individual models varied in their structure and composition, a common opinion emerged that psychological factors are particularly important in the presentation of LBP. Collectively, Components allocated to the “Psychology” Category were the most central in almost half (14/29) of the individual models. Conclusions: The collaborative modeling process outlined in this paper provides a foundation upon which to build a greater understanding and to communicate the complexity of the LBP problem. The next step is to aggregate individual FCMs into a metamodel and begin disentangling the interactions among its Components. This will lead to an improved understanding of the complexity of LBP, and hopefully to improved outcomes for those suffering from this condition.

N2  - Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) is a major and highly prevalent health problem. Given the high number of papers available, clinicians might be overwhelmed by the evidence on CLBP management. Taking into account the scale and costs of CLBP, it is imperative that healthcare professionals have access to up-to-date, evidence-based information to assist them in treatment decision-making. Therefore, this paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of the best evidence non-invasive rehabilitation for CLBP. Taking together up-to-date evidence from systematic reviews, meta-analysis and available treatment guidelines, most physically inactive therapies should not be considered for CLBP management, except for pain neuroscience education and spinal manipulative therapy if combined with exercise therapy, with or without psychological therapy. Regarding active therapy, back schools, sensory discrimination training, proprioceptive exercises, and sling exercises should not be considered due to low-quality and/or conflicting evidence. Exercise interventions on the other hand are recommended, but while all exercise modalities appear effective compared to minimal/passive/conservative/no intervention, there is no evidence that some specific types of exercises are superior to others. Therefore, we recommend choosing exercises in line with the patient’s preferences and abilities. When exercise interventions are combined with a psychological component, effects are better and maintain longer over time.

N2  - Pain is a key component of most rheumatologic diseases. In fibromyalgia, the importance of central nervous system pain mechanisms (for example, loss of descending analgesic activity and central sensitization) is well documented. A few studies have also noted alterations in central pain processing in osteoarthritis, and some data, including the observation of widespread pain sensitivity, suggest that central pain-processing defects may alter the pain response in rheumatoid arthritis patients. When central pain is identified, different classes of analgesics (for example, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, α2δ ligands) may be more effective than drugs that treat peripheral or nociceptive pain (for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids). © 2011 BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Study Design. A comparative study of trunk muscle recruitment patterns in healthy control subjects and patients with chronic low back pain was conducted. Objective. To assess trunk muscle recruitment in patients with low back pain. Summary of Background Data. Conflicting evidence has been reported on the level and pattern of trunk muscle recruitment in patients with low back pain. The disparities can be explained partly by methodologic differences. It was hypothesized that trunk muscle recruitment patterns may be altered in patients with low back pain to compensate for reduced spinal stability. Methods. For this study, 16 patients with low back pain and 16 matched control subjects performed slow trunk motions about the neutral posture and isometric ramp contractions while seated upright. Ratios of electromyographic amplitudes and estimated moment contributions of antagonist over agonist muscles and of segmentally inserting muscles over muscles inserting on the thorax and pelvis only were calculated. In addition, model simulations were performed to assess the effect of changes in muscle recruitment on spinal stability. Results. The ratios of antagonist over agonist, and of lumbar over thoracic erector spinae electromyographic amplitude and estimated moment contributions were greater in the patients than in the control subjects. The simulation model predicted that these changes would effectively increase spinal stability. Conclusions. Trunk muscle recruitment patterns in patients with low back pain are different from those in healthy control subjects. The differences are likely to be functional with respect to enhancement of spinal stability in the patients.

N2  - People with a history of low back pain (LBP) are at high risk to encounter additional LBP episodes. During LBP remission, altered trunk muscle control has been suggested to negatively impact spinal health. As sudden LBP onset is commonly reported during trunk flexion, the aim of the current study is to investigate whether dynamic trunk muscle recruitment is altered in LBP remission. Eleven people in remission of recurrent LBP and 14 pain free controls performed cued trunk flexion during a loaded and unloaded condition. Electromyographic activity was recorded from paraspinal (lumbar and thoracic erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, deep and superficial multifidus) and abdominal muscles (obliquus internus, externus and rectus abdominis) with surface and fine-wire electrodes. LBP participants exhibited higher levels of co-contraction of flexor/extensor muscles, lower agonistic abdominal and higher antagonistic paraspinal muscle activity than controls, both when data were analyzed in grouped and individual muscle behavior. A sub-analysis in people with unilateral LBP (n=.6) pointed to opposing changes in deep and superficial multifidus in relation to the pain side. These results suggest that dynamic trunk muscle control is modified during LBP remission, and might possibly increase spinal load and result in earlier muscle fatigue due to intensified muscle usage. These negative consequences for spinal health could possibly contribute to recurrence of LBP. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Study Design. Prospective case series with historical controls (normative data). Objectives. To compare the aerobic fitness level of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) with healthy controls matched for gender, age, and level of sport activity and to evaluate the association of the difference in aerobic fitness level with pain intensity, duration and degree of disability, fear of injury, and level of activity during work, including household and leisure time. Summary and Background Data. Controversy exists whether patients with CLBP have a lower level of aerobic fitness and whether this level may partly depend on the patients' activity level. Methods. A total of 108 CLBP patients completed questionnaires regarding pain, disability, fear of injury, and activity level and performed a modified Åstrand submaximal cycling test. The maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) was calculated and compared with normative data. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed with the difference of the level of aerobic fitness as dependent variable. Results. VO2max could be calculated in 78% of the patients. Both men and women with CLBP had significant lower VO2max than the healthy referents (10 mL/kg LBM· min-1 and 5.6 mL/kg LBM·min-1 respectively, P < 0.001), and this difference was significantly greater in men (P = 0.03). Multiple regression analysis showed that the level of aerobic fitness was not associated with the presumed variables. The patients who stopped the test prematurely were older (P = 0.02) and more disabled (P = 0.01). Conclusion. CLBP patients, especially men, seem to have a reduced aerobic fitness level compared with the normative population. No explanatory factor for that loss could be identified. ©2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Question: Is there a difference in the level and pattern of free-living physical activity between individuals with chronic low back pain and matched controls? Design: Observational, cross-sectional study. Participants: Fifteen individuals with chronic low back pain and fifteen healthy controls matched for age, gender, and occupation. Outcome measures: Participants wore an activity monitor for seven days. Level of physical activity was measured as time standing and walking, and number of steps averaged over a 24-hour day (midnight to midnight), day time (9.00 am - 4.00 pm), and evening time (6.00 pm - 10.00 pm), and work days versus non-work days. Pattern of physical activity was measured as number of steps and cadence during short (< 20 continuous steps), moderate (20-100 continuous steps), long (> 100-499 continuous steps), and extra long walks (≥ 500 continuous steps). Results: Over an average 24-hour day, the chronic low back pain group spent 0.7 fewer hours (95% CI 0.3 to 1.1) walking, and took 3480 fewer steps (95% CI 1754 to 5207) than the healthy controls. They took 793 fewer steps/day (95% CI -4 to 1591) during moderate walks, and 1214 fewer steps/day (95% CI 425 to 2003) during long walks, and 11 fewer steps/min (95% CI 4 to 17) during extra long walks than the healthy controls. Conclusion: Individuals with chronic low back pain have a lower level, and an altered pattern, of physical activity compared with matched controls. © Australian Physiotherapy Association 2009.

N2  - Different neuroplastic processes can occur along the nociceptive pathways and may be important in the transition from acute to chronic pain and for diagnosis and development of optimal management strategies. The neuroplastic processes may result in gain (sensitisation) or loss (desensitisation) of function in relation to the incoming nociceptive signals. Such processes play important roles in chronic pain, and although the clinical manifestations differ across condition processes, they share some common mechanistic features. The fundamental understanding and quantitative assessment of particularly some of the central sensitisation mechanisms can be translated from preclinical studies into the clinic. The clinical perspectives are implementation of such novel information into diagnostics, mechanistic phenotyping, prevention, personalised treatment, and drug development. The aims of this paper are to introduce and discuss (1) some common fundamental central pain mechanisms, (2) how they may translate into the clinical signs and symptoms across different chronic pain conditions, (3) how to evaluate gain and loss of function using quantitative pain assessment tools, and (4) the implications for optimising prevention and management of pain. The chronic pain conditions selected for the paper are neuropathic pain in general, musculoskeletal pain (chronic low back pain and osteoarthritic pain in particular), and visceral pain (irritable bowel syndrome in particular). The translational mechanisms addressed are local and widespread sensitisation, central summation, and descending pain modulation. Significance: Central sensitisation is an important manifestation involved in many different chronic pain conditions. Central sensitisation can be different to assess and evaluate as the manifestations vary from pain condition to pain condition. Understanding central sensitisation may promote better profiling and diagnosis of pain patients and development of new regimes for mechanism based therapy. Some of the mechanisms underlying central sensitisation can be translated from animals to humans providing new options in development of therapies and profiling drugs under development.

N2  - There are numerous factors that recommend the use of biomarkers in drug development including the ability to provide a rational basis for selection of lead compounds, as an aid in determining or refining mechanism of action or pathophysiology, and the ability to work towards qualification and use of a biomarker as a surrogate endpoint. Examples of biomarkers come from many different means of clinical and laboratory measurement. Total cholesterol is an example of a clinically useful biomarker that was successfully qualified for use as a surrogate endpoint. Biomarkers require validation in most circumstances. Validation of biomarker assays is a necessary component to delivery of high-quality research data necessary for effective use of biomarkers. Qualification is necessary for use of a biomarker as a surrogate endpoint. Putative biomarkers are typically identified because of a relationship to known or hypothetical steps in a pathophysiologic cascade. Biomarker discovery can also be effected by expression profiling experiment using a variety of array technologies and related methods. For example, expression profiling experiments enabled the discovery of adipocyte related complement protein of 30 kD (Acrp30 or adiponectin) as a biomarker for in vivo activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) γ activity.

N2  - Various pain conditions may result in altered autonomic nervous system regulation. We evaluated whether autonomic regulation, analyzed with short-term heart rate variability (HRV), differs between low back pain (LBP) patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we tested if short-term HRV recordings are feasible and informative in planning home monitoring of LBP patients. The study population consisted of 16 volunteers (8 LBP patients and 8 healthy subjects) (age 42±10 years, body mass index 26±4 kg/m2, 7 men and 9 women). Usually 3- to 5-minute R-R interval recordings have been used as short-term recordings of HRV, but recent evidence supports even shorter R-R interval recording procedure for short-term HRV assessment. We collected R-R interval data for 1 minute in sitting, standing and bending down tasks. Mean heart rate (HR) and vagally mediated beat-to-beat variability (SD1 and rMSSD) were analyzed. The results showed that autonomic nervous system function assessed with the short-term measurement HRV method differentiates LBP patients from healthy controls in sitting and standing. Vagally mediated SD1 and rMSSD were significantly lower and the HR was higher among the patients compared to the controls. A novel finding was also the feasibility of 1-minute measurement of HRV, which may open entirely new opportunities to assess accurately concomitant changes in autonomic nervous system function and self-reported individual pain experience. This could lead to a more personalized pain treatment and more efficient health care resource allocation as the new measurement methods is more suitable for home monitoring than the previously used ones.

N2  - Introduction A relevant subsample of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) have manifested augmented central pain processing, central sensitisation (CS). Patients with CLBP have limited functioning and participation. Theoretically, physical functioning in patients with CLBP can plausibly be linked to CS; however, evidence to explain such association is scarce. Moreover, there is no gold standard for CS diagnosis. The objectives of the study are: (1) to analyse the association between instruments assessing reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS; (2) to analyse whether reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS are associated with functioning measurement outcomes; and (3) to analyse whether changes (between baseline and discharge) in reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS are related to changes in each of the functioning measurement outcomes. Methods and analysis A cross-sectional and longitudinal observational study is performed with measurements taken at baseline and discharge of an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme. A sample size of 110 adult patients with CLBP has been calculated for the study. CS measurements are: Central Sensitisation Inventory, quantitative sensory testing and heart rate variability. Functioning measurements are: lifting capacity, maximal aerobic capacity, accelerometry and reported functioning. Statistical analyses to be performed are: (1) correlation between CS measurements, (2) multiple regression between functioning (dependent variable) and CS measurements (independent variable), and (3) multiple regression between changes in scores of functioning (dependent variable) and CS measurements (independent variable), and corrected for sex and age. Ethics and dissemination The study obtained the clearance to its implementation from the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen in July 2017. The results will be disseminated through scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at relevant conferences, and reports to stakeholders. Trial registration number NTR7167/NL6980.

N2  - Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is considered a multifactorial disease that is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. The last two decades of research strongly demonstrate that genetic factors contribute about 75% of the IVDD etiology. Recent total genome sequencing studies have shed light on the various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with IVDD. Aim: This review presents comprehensive and updated information about the diversity of genetic factors in the inflammatory, degradative, homeostatic, and structural systems involved in the IVDD. An organized collection of information is provided regarding genetic polymorphisms that have been identified to influence the risk of developing IVDD. Understanding the proteins and signaling systems involved in IVDD can lead to improved understanding and targeting of therapeutics. Materials and methods: An electronic literature search was performed using the National Library of Medicine for publications using the keywords genetics of IVDD, lumbar disc degeneration, degenerative disc disease, polymorphisms, SNPs, and disc disease. The articles were then screened based on inclusion criteria that included topics that covered the correlation of SNPs with developing IVDD. Sixty-five articles were identified as containing relevant information. Articles were excluded if they investigated lower back pain or just disc herniation without an analysis of disc degeneration. This study focuses on the chronic degeneration of IVDs. Results: Various genes were identified to contain SNPs that influenced the risk of developing IVDD. Among these are genes contributing to structural proteins, such as COL1A1, COL9A3, COL9A3, COL11A1, and COL11A2, ACAN, and CHST3. Furthermore, various SNPs found in the vitamin-D receptor gene are also associated with IVDD. SNPs related to inflammatory cytokine imbalance are associated with IVDD, although some effects are limited by sex and certain populations. SNPs in genes that code for extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, such as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-14, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 are also associated with IVDD. Apoptosis-mediating genes, such as caspase 9 gene (CASP9), TRAIL, and death receptor 4 (DR4), as well as those for growth factors, such as growth differentiation factor 5 and VEGF, are identified to have polymorphisms that influence the risk of developing IVDD. Conclusion: Within the last 10 years, countless new SNPs have been identified in genes previously unknown to be associated with IVDD. Furthermore, the last decade has also revealed new SNPs identified in genes already known to be involved with increased risk of developing IVDD. Improved understanding of the numerous genetic variants behind various pathophysiological elements of IVDD could help advance personalized care and pharmacotherapeutic strategies for patients suffering from IVDD in the future.

N2  - Clinical reports and research studies have documented the behavior of chronic low back and neck pain patients. A few hypotheses have attempted to explain these varied clinical and research findings. A new hypothesis, based upon the concept that subfailure injuries of ligaments (spinal ligaments, disc annulus and facet capsules) may cause chronic back pain due to muscle control dysfunction, is presented. The hypothesis has the following sequential steps. Single trauma or cumulative microtrauma causes subfailure injuries of the ligaments and embedded mechanoreceptors. The injured mechanoreceptors generate corrupted transducer signals, which lead to corrupted muscle response pattern produced by the neuromuscular control unit. Muscle coordination and individual muscle force characteristics, i.e. onset, magnitude, and shut-off, are disrupted. This results in abnormal stresses and strains in the ligaments, mechanoreceptors and muscles, and excessive loading of the facet joints. Due to inherently poor healing of spinal ligaments, accelerated degeneration of disc and facet joints may occur. The abnormal conditions may persist, and, over time, may lead to chronic back pain via inflammation of neural tissues. The hypothesis explains many of the clinical observations and research findings about the back pain patients. The hypothesis may help in a better understanding of chronic low back and neck pain patients, and in improved clinical management. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

N2  - Despite ‘abnormal’ motion being considered a risk factor for low back injury, the current understanding of ‘normal’ spine motion is limited. Identifying normal motion within an individual is complicated by the considerable variation in movement patterns amongst healthy individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize sources of variation in spine motion among a sample of healthy participants. The second objective of this study was to develop a multivariate model capable of predicting an expected movement pattern for an individual. The kinematic shape of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine was recorded during a constrained dynamic trunk flexion movement; as this is not a normal everyday movement task, movements are considered ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ for this task rather than ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’. Variations in neutral standing posture accounted for 85% of the variation in spine motion throughout the task. Differences in total spine range of flexion and a regional re-weighting of range of motion between lower thoracic and lumbar regions explained a further 9% of the variance among individuals. The analysis also highlighted a difference in temporal sequencing of motion between lower thoracic and lumbar regions which explained 2% of the total movement variation. These identified sources of variation were used to select independent variables for a multivariate linear model capable of predicting an individuals’ expected movement pattern. This was done as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how the error between predicted and observed motion patterns could be used to differentiate between ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ movement strategies.

N2  - The study investigated the potential for obtaining more accurate spine joint reaction force (JRF) estimates from musculoskeletal models by incorporating dynamic stereo X-ray imaging (DSX)-based in vivo lumbar vertebral rotational and translational kinematics compared to generic, rhythm (RHY)-based kinematics, while also observing the influence of accompanying inputs: intervertebral segment stiffness and neutral state. A full-body OpenSim® musculoskeletal model, constructed by combining existing lower- and upper-body models, was driven based on one volunteer's (female; age 25; 60.8 kg; 176 cm) anthropometrics and kinematics from a series of upright standing and straight-legged dynamic lifting tasks. The lumbar spine portion was modified in a step-wise manner to observe effects of: (1) RHY vs. DSX lumbar kinematics; (2) No disc (bushing) stiffness (NBS); generic, linear bushing stiffness (LBS); subject-specific nonlinear bushing stiffness (NLBS); (3) Upright standing (UP) vs. Supine (SUP) neutral state; (4) Weight lifted: 4.5 kg vs. 13.6 kg. L4L5 JRF from 24 model variations based on combinations of aforementioned parameters were compared. Rhythm-based kinematics without translational components tends to over-predict JRF (31% and 39% for compression and shear, respectively) compared to DSX-based kinematics. Additionally, differences due to accompanying passive stiffness and neutral state choice combinations were even larger (>50%), indicating heightened demand on the quality of these accompanying inputs. The study not only highlights model sensitivity to choices made regarding the three primary inputs—kinematics, passive stiffness and neutral state— separately, but also how interactions between these choices can result in significant variability in joint loading estimates.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN. A longitudinal assessment of the association between pain-related fear and joint motions in 36 participants with subacute low back pain. OBJECTIVES. To determine how the psychologic construct of pain-related fear maps to motor behavior in standardized reaching tasks. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Pain-related fear is a significant predictor of avoidance behavior and occupational disability in individuals with low back pain. However, it is not currently known how pain-related fear maps to motor behavior. METHODS. Participants with an episode of subacute LBP were tested at 3, 6, and 12 weeks following pain onset. Participants performed reaching tasks at comfortable and fast-paced movement speeds to 3 targets (high, middle, low) located in a midsagittal plane. Three-dimensional joint motions of the thoracic spine, lumbar spine, and hip were recorded using an electromagnetic tracking device. Group differences in joint excursions were assessed using 2 groups (high pain-related fear, low pain-related fear) × 3 times (3, 6, 12 weeks) × 2 movement speeds (comfortable, fast paced) × 3 target heights (high, middle, low) MANOVAs. RESULTS. Individuals with high pain-related fear had smaller excursions of the lumbar spine for reaches to all targets at 3 and 6 weeks, but not at 12 weeks following pain onset. CONCLUSION. Individuals with high pain-related fear adopt alternative movement strategies and avoid motion of the lumbar spine when performing a common reaching movement. Identifying how pain-related fear maps to actual motor behavior (i.e., alternative movement strategies) is a crucial first step in determining how pain-related fear and motor behavior interact to promote or delay recovery from acute low back pain. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Study Design. A nonlinear fi nite element study of a lumbar spine with different patternsa' of multilevel intervertebral disc degeneration. Objective. To determine how different patterns of multilevel disc degeneration influence the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine. Summary of Background Data. Because of the complex etiology of low back pain, it is often diffi cult to identify the specifi c factors that contribute to the symptoms of a particular patient. Disc degeneration is associated with the development of low back pain, but its presence is not always synonymous with symptoms. However, studies have suggested that patternsa of disc degeneration may provide insight into such pain generation rather than the overall presence of degenerative changes. Specifi cally, individuals with contiguous multilevel disc degeneration have been shown to exhibit higher presence and severity of low back pain than patients with skipped-level disc degeneration ( i.e. , healthy discs located in between degenerated discs). Methods. In this study, the biomechanical differences between these patterns were analyzed using a nonlinear fi nite element model of the lumbar spine. Thirteen separate patternsa of disc degeneration were evaluated using the model and simulated under normal physiological loading conditions in each of the primary modes of spinal motion. Results. The results showed that stresses and forces of the surrounding ligaments, facets, and pedicles at certain vertebral levels of the spine were generally lower in skipped-level disc degeneration cases than in the contiguous multilevel disc degenerations cases even when the skipped level contained more degenerated discs. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the fi rst study to illustrate the biomechanics of specifi c patterns of disc degeneration of the lumbar spine. Using a multilevel disc degeneration model, our study provides insights as to why various patterns of disc degeneration throughout the lumbar spine may affect motion and soft tissue structures as well that may have bearing in the clinical pathway of pain generation.

N2  - There are bi-directional interactions between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and pain. This is likely underpinned by a substantial overlap between brain areas of the central autonomic network and areas involved in pain processing and modulation. To date, however, relatively little is known about the neuronal substrates of the ANS-pain association. Here, we acquired resting state fMRI scans in 21 healthy subjects at rest and during tonic noxious cold stimulation. As indicators of autonomic function, we examined how heart rate variability (HRV) frequency measures were influenced by tonic noxious stimulation and how these variables related to participants' pain perception and to brain functional connectivity in regions known to play a role in both ANS regulation and pain perception, namely the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Our findings support a role of the cardiac ANS in brain connectivity during pain, linking functional connections of the dACC and PAG with measurements of low frequency (LF)-HRV. In particular, we identified a three-way relationship between the ANS, cortical brain networks known to underpin pain processing, and participants' subjectively reported pain experiences. LF-HRV both at rest and during pain correlated with functional connectivity between the seed regions and other cortical areas including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left anterior insula (AI), and the precuneus. Our findings link cardiovascular autonomic parameters to brain activity changes involved in the elaboration of nociceptive information, thus beginning to elucidate underlying brain mechanisms associated with the reciprocal relationship between autonomic and pain-related systems.

N2  - Objectives: To assess the interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM), using power spectrum analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, we explored the association between HRV, measures of tenderness, FM symptoms, physical function, psychological well being and quality of life. Methods: We studied 22 women with FM and 22 age-matched healthy women. Twenty-minute electrocardiogram recordings were obtained in a supine position during complete rest. Spectral analysis of R-R intervals was done by the fast- Fourier transform algorithm. Results: Heart rate was significantly higher in FM patients compared with controls (P < .006). FM patients had significantly lower HRV compared with controls (P = .001), and higher low-frequency (LF) and lower high-frequency (HF) components of PSA than controls (P < .001). Quality of life, physical function, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress were moderately to highly correlated with LF, HF (in normalized units), and LF/HF. No association was observed between HRV parameters and measures of tenderness and FM symptoms. Conclusions: The basal autonomic state of patients with FM is characterized by increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic tones. Autonomic dysregulation may have implications regarding the symptomatology, physical and psychological aspects of health status. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B. Saunders Company.

N2  - Endogenous pain regulatory system dysfunction appears to play a role in the maintenance of chronic pain. An important component of the pain regulatory process is the functional interaction between the cardiovascular and pain regulatory systems, which results in an association between elevated resting blood pressure (BP) and diminished acute pain sensitivity. This BP/pain sensitivity relationship is proposed to reflect a homeostatic feedback loop helping restore arousal levels in the presence of painful stimuli. Evidence is emerging that this normally adaptive BP/pain sensitivity relationship is significantly altered in chronic pain conditions, affecting responsiveness to both acute and chronic pain stimuli. Several mechanisms that may underlie this adaptive relationship in healthy individuals are overviewed, including endogenous opioid, noradrenergic, and baroreceptor-related mechanisms. Theoretical models are presented regarding how chronic pain-related alterations in the mechanisms above and increased pain facilatory system activity (central sensitization) may contribute to altered BP/pain sensitivity interactions in chronic pain. Clinical implications are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective To assess the evidence of association between atherosclerosis and low back pain (LBP). Type Focused systematic review. Literature Survey PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched for original research articles, not limited by language, from January 1, 1990, to October 31, 2016. Methodology Titles and then abstracts were identified using predefined search terms and excluded based on lack of relevancy. This was followed by full-text reviews. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality based on Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Synthesis A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the studies was low to moderate. There was significant heterogeneity across articles with respect to methodology. There was insufficient evidence to support an association between ischemia and low back pain. Conclusions The cause of LBP remains poorly understood. Better insight into how intervertebral disk changes relate to LBP is needed to guide future research. High-quality prospective studies are needed to answer the question of whether atherosclerosis is a risk factor for LBP. Level of Evidence II

N2  - Background: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) interests many chiropractors and manual therapists, because joint manipulative techniques (JMT), e.g. high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) manipulations and mobilizations, appear to produce acute changes in ANS mediated physiology. The complexity of this issue justifies a systematic critical literature review. Objective: To review the literature comparing the acute changes in markers of ANS activity between JMT applied on spinal or peripheral joints and a sham procedure in healthy or symptomatic subjects. Method: We searched PsycINFO, PEDro, PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, and Medline up to December 2017. We updated the search with PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, and Medline including July 2018. Inclusion criteria were: randomized sham-controlled trials assessing the effect of JMT on markers of ANS activity; manually applied JMT, regardless of technique, applied on either healthy or symptomatic humans; outcome measurements recorded at baseline and repeated during and/or after interventions. Selection of articles and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. The quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane 'risk of bias' tool and a technical check-list. Results were reported narratively with some meta-analyses. The Cochrane GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Results: Twenty-nine of 2267 studies were included in the synthesis. Mobilizations (oscillatory technique) probably produce an immediate and short-term, bilateral increase in skin sympathetic nerve activity (reflected by an increase in skin conductance) regardless of the area treated (moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether the sympathetic arousal also explains an increase in respiratory rate (very low-certainty evidence). Our evaluation of the literature suggests that spinal sustained apophyseal glides (SNAGs) mobilization and HVLA manipulation of the spine may have no acute effect on the studied markers of ANS activity (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Conclusion: Some types of mobilizations probably produce an immediate and short-term, statistically significant increase in skin sympathetic nerve activity when compared to a sham procedure, whereas spinal SNAGs and spinal HVLA techniques may have no acute effect on the studied markers of ANS activity. No region-specific results were noted. The literature suffers from several shortcomings, for which reason we strongly suggest further research.

N2  - Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances. Keywords:

N2  - Study Design. Longitudinal cohort study of twins representative of the general population. Objective. To assess the relationship between Modic change (MC) and severe, disabling low back pain (LBP), features of intervertebral disc degeneration (DD) and incident MC during 10-year follow-up. Summary of Background Data. MC describes vertebral endplate and bone marrow lesions visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MC has been associated with DD. It remains unclear whether MC causes LBP independently or through association with DD. Moreover, association of MC with severe, disabling LBP is uncertain. Methods. Volunteers were recruited from the TwinsUK register to MRI and interview between 1996 and 2000 with a subset attending for follow-up a decade later. MC, DD (evaluated by loss of disc height and signal intensity, presence of disc bulge and anterior osteophytes) and Schmorl's nodes (SN) were determined on T2- weighted lumbar MR scans. Results. Complete data were available for 823 subjects at baseline and 429 at follow-up. Mean age at baseline was 54.0 years (range 32â€"70) with 96% females. The prevalence of MC was 32.2% at baseline and 48.7% at follow-up. Subjects with MC were older ( P < 0.001) and more overweight (BMI: P = 0.026, weight: P < 0.001). At both baseline and follow-up, more subjects reporting severe LBP demonstrated MC (subjects with MC vs . without MC: 35.0% vs . 16.4% respectively, P < 0.001 at baseline; and 35.1% vs . 20.0% respectively, P < 0.001 at follow-up). In multivariable analyses, MC remained signifi cantly associated with episodes of severe, disabling LBP (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.04â€"2.41) after adjustment for age, BMI, DD, and SN at baseline. Loss of disc height and disc signal intensity were independently associated with prevalent MC at baseline, and disc height and disc bulge with incident MC during follow-up. Conclusion. MC is an independent risk factor for episodes of severe and disabling LBP in middle-aged women. These observations support further work aimed at identifying the precise histology underlying MC.

N2  - Valid and reliable biomarkers can play an important role in clinical trials as indicators of biological or pathogenic processes or as a signal of treatment response. Currently, there are no biomarkers for pain qualified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency for use in clinical trials. This article summarizes an Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials meeting in which 3 potential biomarkers were discussed for use in the development of analgesic treatments: 1) sensory testing, 2) skin punch biopsy, and 3) brain imaging. The empirical evidence supporting the use of these tests is described within the context of the 4 categories of biomarkers: 1) diagnostic, 2) prognostic, 3) predictive, and 4) pharmacodynamic. Although sensory testing, skin punch biopsy, and brain imaging are promising tools for pain in clinical trials, additional evidence is needed to further support and standardize these tests for use as biomarkers in pain clinical trials. Perspective The applicability of sensory testing, skin biopsy, and brain imaging as diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for use in analgesic treatment trials is considered. Evidence in support of their use and outlining problems is presented, as well as a call for further standardization and demonstrations of validity and reliability.

N2  - This book provides up-to-date information on all aspects of orofacial pain biomarkers. It opens by presenting background information on clinical phenotypes and the neurobiological substrates underlying chronic orofacial pain and by explaining the potential role of biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and treatment of orofacial pain. The main section of the book examines the contribution of human and animal studies to the field of biomarkers for orofacial pain and discusses biomarkers for masticatory muscle pain, temporomandibular joint pain, neuropathic face pain, and autonomic nervous system involvement in trigeminal facial pain. The potential impacts of the immune system on orofacial pain biomarkers and candidate gene phenotypes with possible links to chronic orofacial pain conditions are also addressed, and differences and similarities between saliva and serum biomarkers for pain are explained as well. The final section covers research-related issues in assessment methods and statistical analyses used in evaluating biomarkers, identifies future challenges and suggests new directions in the field.

N2  - Objective This study systematically summarizes biochemical biomarker research in non-traumatic musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Two research questions guided the review: (i) Are there biochemical markers associated with neck and upper-extremity MSD? and (ii) Are there biochemical markers associated with the severity of neck and upper-extremity MSD? Methods A literature search was conducted in PubMed and SCOPUS, and 87 studies met primary inclusion criteria. Following a quality screen, data were extracted from 44 articles of sufficient quality. Results Most of the 87 studies were cross-sectional and utilized convenience samples of patients as both cases and controls. A response rate was explicitly stated in only 11 (13%) studies. Less than half of the studies controlled for potential confounding through restriction or in the analysis. Most sufficient-quality studies were conducted in older populations (mean age in one or more analysis group >50 years). In sufficient-quality articles, 82% demonstrated at least one statistically significant association between the MSD and biomarker(s) studied. Evidence suggested that: (i) the collagen-repair marker TIMP-1 is decreased in fibroproliferative disorders, (ii) 5-HT (serotonin) is increased in trapezius myalgia, and (iii) triglycerides are increased in a variety of MSD. Only 5 studies showed an association between a biochemical marker and MSD severity. Conclusion While some MSD biomarkers were identified, limitations in the articles examined included possible selection bias, confounding, spectrum effect (potentially heterogeneous biomarker associations in populations according to symptom severity or duration), and insufficient attention to comorbid conditions. A list of recommendations for future studies is provided.

N2  - Biomarkers are important in stress biology in relation to assessing individual and population health. They facilitate tapping meaningfully into the complex, non-linear interactions that affect the brain and multiple systems of the body and promote adaptation or, when dysregulated, they can accelerate disease processes. This has demanded a multifactorial approach to the choice of biomarkers. This is necessary in order to adequately describe and predict how an individual embedded in a particular social and physical environment, and with a unique genotype and set of lifetime experiences, will fare in terms of health and disease risk, as well as how that individual will respond to an intervention. Yet, at the same time, single biomarkers can have a predictive or diagnostic value when combined with carefully designed longitudinal assessment of behavior and disease related to stress. Moreover, the methods of brain imaging, themselves the reflection of the complexity of brain functional architecture, have provided new ways of diagnosing, and possibly differentiating, subtypes of depressive illness and anxiety disorders that are precipitated or exacerbated by stress. Furthermore, postmortem assessment of brain biomarkers provides important clues about individual vulnerability for suicide related to depression and this may lead to predictive biomarkers to better treat individuals with suicidal depression. Once biomarkers are available, approaches to prevention and treatment should take advantage of the emerging evidence that activating brain plasticity together with targeted behavioral interventions is a promising strategy.

N2  - Biomarkers are critical to the rational development of medical therapeutics, but significant confusion persists regarding fundamental definitions and concepts involved in their use in research and clinical practice, particularly in the fields of chronic disease and nutrition. Clarification of the definitions of different biomarkers and a better understanding of their appropriate application could result in substantial benefits. This review examines biomarker definitions recently established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health as part of their joint Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools (BEST) resource. These definitions are placed in context of their respective uses in patient care, clinical research, or therapeutic development. We explore the distinctions between biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments and discuss the specific definitions and applications of diagnostic, monitoring, pharmacodynamic/response, predictive, prognostic, safety, and susceptibility/risk biomarkers. We also explore the implications of current biomarker development trends, including complex composite biomarkers and digital biomarkers derived from sensors and mobile technologies. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential benefits of biomarker-driven predictive toxicology and systems pharmacology, the need to ensure quality and reproducibility of the science underlying biomarker development, and the importance of fostering collaboration across the entire ecosystem of medical product development. Impact statement: Biomarkers are critical to the rational development of medical diagnostics and therapeutics, but significant confusion persists regarding fundamental definitions and concepts involved in their use in research and clinical practice. Clarification of the definitions of different biomarker classes and a better understanding of their appropriate application could yield substantial benefits. Biomarker definitions recently established in a joint FDA-NIH resource place different classes of biomarkers in the context of their respective uses in patient care, clinical research, or therapeutic development. Complex composite biomarkers and digital biomarkers derived from sensors and mobile technologies, together with biomarker-driven predictive toxicology and systems pharmacology, are reshaping development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. An approach to biomarker development that prioritizes the quality and reproducibility of the science underlying biomarker development and incorporates collaborative regulatory science involving multiple disciplines will lead to rational, evidence-based biomarker development that keeps pace with scientific and clinical need.

N2  - The normal intervertebral disc (IVD) is a poorly innervated organ supplied only by sensory (mainly nociceptive) and postganglionic sympathetic (vasomotor efferents) nerve fibers. Interestingly, upon degeneration, the IVD becomes densely innervated even in regions that in normal conditions lack innervation. This increased innervation has been associated with pain of IVD origin. The mechanisms responsible for nerve growth and hyperinnervation of pathological IVDs have not been fully elucidated. Among the molecules that are presumably involved in this process are some members of the family of neurotrophins (NTs), which are known to have both neurotrophic and neurotropic properties and regulate the density and distribution of nerve fibers in peripheral tissues. NTs and their receptors are expressed in healthy IVDs but much higher levels have been observed in pathological IVDs, thus suggesting a correlation between levels of expression of NTs and density of innervation in IVDs. In addition, NTs also play a role in inflammatory responses and pain transmission by increasing the expression of pain-related peptides and modulating synapses of nociceptive neurons at the spinal cord. This article reviews current knowledge about the innervation of IVDs, NTs and NT receptors, expression of NTs and their receptors in IVDs as well as in the sensory neurons innervating the IVDs, the proinflammatory role of NTs, NTs as nociception regulators, and the potential network of discogenic pain involving NTs. © 2010 The Authors.

N2  - Background. Several studies have investigated differences in paraspinal muscle morphology between patients with low back pain (LBP) and control patients. However, inconsistencies in the results of some of these studies may limit generalizations. Objective. The purpose of this study was to systematically review studies evaluating paraspinal muscle morphology in patients with LBP and control patients, with a focus on the effects of blinding. Data Sources. An electronic search was performed with the use of relevant databases. Study quality was evaluated by means of the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Study Selection. Case-control studies investigating paraspinal muscle size between patients with LBP and control patients who were healthy were included. Studies that compared paraspinal muscle size between symptomatic and asymptomatic sides of patients with unilateral LBP also were included. Data Extraction. Studies investigating the same outcome-at the same spinal level and for the same muscle and population-were pooled. Mean differences with 95% confidence interval were calculated for each study. Data Synthesis. Eleven studies were included. With 1 exception, all pooled results were significantly different statistically between groups, suggesting that para-spinal muscles are smaller in patients with chronic LBP than in control patients and on the symptomatic side of patients with chronic unilateral LBP. In patients with acute unilateral LBP, there was no significant difference between sides. A qualitative examination demonstrated a trend toward an increased effect size when outcome assessors were unblinded. Limitations. Limitations of this review include the small number of studies included and their small sample size. Misclassification of blinding status may have occurred when the study did not report blinding status. Conclusions. Evidence suggests that paraspinal muscles are significantly smaller in patients with chronic LBP than in control patients. Although no definite conclusion could be taken as to the effects of blinding, future imaging studies should consider the use of blinded outcome assessors. © 2013 American Physical Therapy Association.

N2  - Microneurographic measurements of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) have suggested that, during static exercise, central command is much less important than skeletal muscle afferents in causing sympathetic neural activation. The possibility remains, however, that the sympathetic discharge produced by central command is targeted mainly to tissues other than skeletal muscle. To examine this possibility, we recorded SNA with microelectrodes placed selectively in skin, as well as in muscle, nerve fascicles of the peroneal nerve during static handgrip maneuvers designed to separate the effects of central command from those of muscle afferents. To study the relative effects of cutaneous sympathetic activation on sudomotor versus vasomoter function, we simultaneously estimated changes in skin blood flow (laser Doppler velocimetry) and in sudomotor (electrodermal) activation in the region of skin innervated by the impaled nerve fascicle. Two minutes of static handgrip at 10%, 20%, and 30% of maximal voluntary contraction caused large and intensity-dependent increases in skin SNA. These increases in SNA immediately preceded the onset of muscle tension, accelerated progressively during sustained handgrip, and resolved promptly with the cessation of motor effort. The handgrip-induced increases in skin SNA were not maintained when handgrip was followed by arrest of the forearm circulation, a maneuver that maintains the stimulation of chemically sensitive muscle afferents while eliminating the influences of central command and mechanically sensitive muscle afferents. During normothermia, static handgrip at 30% maximal voluntary contraction caused sustained increases in skin SNA (+400 ± 83%, mean ± SEM, p < 0.05) and in electrodermal activity (+276 ± 56%, p < 0.05) but only transient increases in estimated skin vascular resistance (+11 ± 2%, p < 0.05). When skin temperature was increased or decreased to a new stable baseline level, subsequent increases in skin SNA during handgrip were accompanied by sustained but directionally opposite changes in estimated skin vascular resistance, with exercise-induced vasodilation during hyperthermia but exercise-induced vasoconstriction during hypothermia. From these observations, we conclude the following: 1) static exercise markedly increases sympathetic outflow to skin as well as to skeletal muscle; 2) the increases in skin SNA, unlike muscle SNA, appear to be caused mainly by central command rather than by muscle afferent reflexes; and 3) this cutaneous sympathetic activation appears to be targeted both to sweat glands and to vascular smooth muscle, with the relative targeting being temperature dependent. These findings provide neurophysiological evidence in humans to support the hypothesis that central command can be a potent stimulus to sympathetic outflow, and they emphasize the marked heterogeneity in the regulation of regional sympathetic discharge during exercise by central neural and peripheral reflex mechanisms.

N2  - Previous reports showed that sympathetic stimulation affects the activity of muscle spindle afferents (MSAs). The aim of the present work is to study the characteristics of sympathetic modulation of MSA response to stretch: (i) on the dynamic and static components of the stretch response, and (ii) on group Ia and II MSAs to evaluate potentially different effects. In anaesthetised rabbits, the peripheral stump of the cervical sympathetic nerve (CSN) was stimulated at 10 impulses s-1 for 45-90 s. The responses of single MSAs to trapezoidal displacement of the mandible were recorded from the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. The following characteristic parameters were determined from averaged trapezoidal responses: initial frequency (IF), peak frequency at the end of the ramp (PF) and static index (SI). From these, other parameters were derived: dynamic index (DI = PF - SI), dynamic difference (DD = PF - IF) and static difference (SD = SI - IF). The effects of CSN stimulation were also evaluated during changes in the state of intrafusal muscle fibre contraction induced by succinylcholine and curare. In a population of 124 MSAs, 106 units (85.4 %) were affected by sympathetic stimulation. In general, while changes in resting discharge varied among different units (Ia vs. II) and experimental conditions (curarised vs. non-curarised), ranging from enhancement to strong depression of firing, the amplitude of the response to muscle stretches consistently decreased. This was confirmed and detailed in a quantitative analysis performed on 49 muscle spindle afferents. In both the non-curarised (23 units) and curarised (26 units) condition, stimulation of the CSN reduced the response amplitude in terms of DD and SD, but hardly affected DI. The effects were equally present in both Ia and II units; they were shown to be independent from gamma drive and intrafusal muscle tone and not secondary to muscle hypoxia. Sympathetic action on the resting discharge (IF) was less consistent. In the noncurarised condition, IF decreased in most Ia units, while in II units decreases and increases occurred equally often. In the curarised condition, IF in group II units mostly increased. The results have important functional implications on the control of motor function in a state of 'high' sympathetic activity, like excessive stress, as well as in certain pathological conditions such as sympathetically maintained pain.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of sympathetic innervation in human muscle spindles, using antibodies against neuropeptide Y (NPY), NPY receptors and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). A total of 232 muscle spindles were immunohistochemically examined. NPY and NPY receptors were found on the intrafusal fibers, on the blood vessels supplying muscle spindles and on free nerve endings in the periaxial space. TH-immunoreactivity was present mainly in the spindle nerve and vessel. This is, to our knowledge, the first morphological study concerning the sympathetic innervation of the human muscle spindles. The results provide anatomical evidence for direct sympathetic innervation of the intrafusal fibers and show that sympathetic innervation is not restricted to the blood vessels supplying spindles. Knowledge about direct sympathetic innervation of the muscle spindle might expand our understanding of motor and proprioceptive dysfunction under stress conditions, for example, chronic muscle pain syndromes.

N2  - Nonspecific chronic spinal pain (NSCSP) is highly disabling. Current conservative rehabilitation commonly includes physical and behavioral interventions, or a combination of these approaches. Physical interventions aim to enhance physical capacity by using methods such as exercise, manual therapy, and ergonomics. Behavioral/psychologically informed interventions aim to enhance behaviors, cognitions, or mood by using methods such as relaxation and cognitive behavioral therapy. Combined interventions aim to target physical and also behavioral/psychological factors contributing to patients' pain by using methods such as multidisciplinary pain management programs. Because it remains unclear whether any of these approaches are superior, this review aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of physical, behavioral/psychologically informed, and combined interventions on pain and disability in patients with NSCSP. Ten electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including participants reporting NSCSP. Studies were required to have an "active" conservative treatment control group for comparison. Studies were not eligible if the interventions were from the same domain (eg, if the study compared 2 physical interventions). Study quality was assessed used the Cochrane Back Review Group risk of bias criteria. The treatment effects of physical, behavioral/psychologically informed, and combined interventions were assessed using meta-analyses. Twenty-four studies were included. No clinically significant differences were found for pain and disability between physical, behavioral/psychologically informed, and combined interventions. The simple categorization of interventions into physical, behavioral/psychologically informed, and combined could be considered a limitation of this review, because these interventions may not be easily differentiated to allow accurate comparisons to be made. Further work should consider investigating whether tailoring rehabilitation to individual patients and their perceived risk of chronicity, as seen in recent RCTs for low back pain, can enhance outcomes in NSCSP. Perspective In this systematic review of RCTs in NSCSP, only small differences in pain or disability were observed between physical, behavioral/psychologically informed, and combined interventions.

N2  - Many clinical practice guidelines recommend similar approaches for the assessment and management of low back pain. Recommendations include use of a biopsychosocial framework to guide management with initial non-pharmacological treatment, including education that supports self-management and resumption of normal activities and exercise, and psychological programmes for those with persistent symptoms. Guidelines recommend prudent use of medication, imaging, and surgery. The recommendations are based on trials almost exclusively from high-income countries, focused mainly on treatments rather than on prevention, with limited data for cost-effectiveness. However, globally, gaps between evidence and practice exist, with limited use of recommended first-line treatments and inappropriately high use of imaging, rest, opioids, spinal injections, and surgery. Doing more of the same will not reduce back-related disability or its long-term consequences. The advances with the greatest potential are arguably those that align practice with the evidence, reduce the focus on spinal abnormalities, and ensure promotion of activity and function, including work participation. We have identified effective, promising, or emerging solutions that could offer new directions, but that need greater attention and further research to determine if they are appropriate for large-scale implementation. These potential solutions include focused strategies to implement best practice, the redesign of clinical pathways, integrated health and occupational interventions to reduce work disability, changes in compensation and disability claims policies, and public health and prevention strategies.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Back pain treatment is costly and frequently includes overuse of treatments that are unsupported by clinical guidelines. Few studies have evaluated recent national trends in guideline adherence of spine-related care. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the treatment of back pain from January 1, 1999, through December 26, 2010. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Using nationally representative data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, we studied outpatient visits with a chief symptom and/or primary diagnosis of back or neck pain, as well as those with secondary symptoms and diagnoses of back or neck pain.We excluded visits with concomitant "red flags," including fever, neurologic symptoms, or cancer. Results were analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for patient and health care professional characteristics and weighted to reflect national estimates.We also present adjusted results stratified by symptom duration and whether the health care professional was the primary care physician (PCP). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed imaging, narcotics, and referrals to physicians (guideline discordant indicators). In addition, we evaluated use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen and referrals to physical therapy (guideline concordant indicators). RESULTS: We identified 23 918 visits for spine problems, representing an estimated 440 million visits. Approximately 58%of patients were female. Mean age increased from 49 to 53 years (P < .001) during the study period. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or acetaminophen use per visit decreased from 36.9%in 1999-2000 to 24.5%in 2009-2010 (unadjusted P < .001). In contrast, narcotic use increased from 19.3%to 29.1% (P < .001). Although physical therapy referrals remained unchanged at approximately 20%, physician referrals increased from 6.8%to 14.0%(P < .001). The number of radiographs remained stable at approximately 17%, whereas the number of computed tomograms or magnetic resonance images increased from 7.2%to 11.3%during the study period (P < .001). These trends were similar after stratifying by short-term vs long-term presentations, visits to PCPs vs non-PCPs, and adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, PCP status, symptom duration, region, and metropolitan location. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite numerous published clinical guidelines, management of back pain has relied increasingly on guideline discordant care. Improvements in the management of spine-related disease represent an area of potential cost savings for the health care system with the potential for improving the quality of care.

N2  - Background: Scoping reviews are a relatively new approach to evidence synthesis and currently there exists little guidance regarding the decision to choose between a systematic review or scoping review approach when synthesising evidence. The purpose of this article is to clearly describe the differences in indications between scoping reviews and systematic reviews and to provide guidance for when a scoping review is (and is not) appropriate. Results: Researchers may conduct scoping reviews instead of systematic reviews where the purpose of the review is to identify knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify concepts or to investigate research conduct. While useful in their own right, scoping reviews may also be helpful precursors to systematic reviews and can be used to confirm the relevance of inclusion criteria and potential questions. Conclusions: Scoping reviews are a useful tool in the ever increasing arsenal of evidence synthesis approaches. Although conducted for different purposes compared to systematic reviews, scoping reviews still require rigorous and transparent methods in their conduct to ensure that the results are trustworthy. Our hope is that with clear guidance available regarding whether to conduct a scoping review or a systematic review, there will be less scoping reviews being performed for inappropriate indications better served by a systematic review, and vice-versa.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN Descriptive method guidelines. OBJECTIVES To help reviewers design, conduct, and report reviews of trials in the field of back and neck pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA In 1997, the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group published method guidelines for systematic reviews. Since its publication, new methodologic evidence emerged and more experience was acquired in conducting reviews. METHODS All reviews and protocols of the Back Review Group were assessed for compliance with the 1997 method guidelines. Also, the most recent version of the Cochrane Handbook (4.1) was checked for new recommendations. In addition, some important topics that were not addressed in the 1997 method guidelines were included (e.g., methods for qualitative analysis, reporting of conclusions, and discussion of clinical relevance of the results). In May 2002, preliminary results were presented and discussed in a workshop. In two rounds, a list of all possible recommendations and the final draft were circulated for comments among the editors of the Back Review Group. RESULTS The recommendations are divided in five categories: literature search, inclusion criteria, methodologic quality assessment, data extraction, and data analysis. Each recommendation is classified in minimum criteria and further guidance. Additional recommendations are included regarding assessment of clinical relevance, and reporting of results and conclusions. CONCLUSIONS Systematic reviews need to be conducted as carefully as the trials they report and, to achieve full impact, systematic reviews need to meet high methodologic standards.

N2  - Introduction: In individuals having low back pain, the application of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) has been shown to reduce spinal stiffness in those who report improvements in post-SMT disability. The underlying mechanism for this rapid change in stiffness is not understood presently. As clinicians and patients may benefit from a better understanding of this mechanism in terms of optimizing care delivery, the objective of this scoping review of current literature was to identify if potential mechanisms that explain this clinical response have been previously described or could be elucidated from existing data. Methods: Three literature databases were systematically searched (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PubMed). Our search terms included subject headings and keywords relevant to SMT, spinal stiffness, lumbar spine, and mechanism. Inclusion criteria for candidate studies were publication in English, quantification of lumbar spinal stiffness before and after SMT, and publication between January 2000 and June 2019. Results: The search identified 1931 articles. Of these studies, 10 were included following the application of the inclusion criteria. From these articles, 7 themes were identified with respect to potential mechanisms described or derived from data: 1) change in muscle activity; 2) increase in mobility; 3) decrease in pain; 4) increase in pressure pain threshold; 5) change in spinal tissue behavior; 6) change in the central nervous system or reflex pathways; and 7) correction of a vertebral dysfunction. Conclusions: This scoping review identified 7 themes put forward by authors to explain changes in spinal stiffness following SMT. Unfortunately, none of the studies provided data which would support the promotion of one theme over another. As a result, this review suggests a need to develop a theoretical framework to explain rapid biomechanical changes following SMT to guide and prioritize future investigations in this important clinical area.

N2  - The presence of an evaluative audience can alter skilled motor performance through changes in force output. To investigate how this is mediated within the brain, we emulated real-time social monitoring of participants performance of a fine grip task during functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging. We observed an increase in force output during social evaluation that was accompanied by focal reductions in activity within bilateral inferior parietal cortex. Moreover, deactivation of the left inferior parietal cortex predicted both inter-and intra-individual differences in socially-induced change in grip force. Social evaluation also enhanced activation within the posterior superior temporal sulcus, which conveys visual information about others (tm) actions to the inferior parietal cortex. Interestingly, functional connectivity between these two regions was attenuated by social evaluation. Our data suggest that social evaluation can vary force output through the altered engagement of inferior parietal cortex; a region implicated in sensorimotor integration necessary for object manipulation, and a component of the action-observation network which integrates and facilitates performance of observed actions. Social-evaluative situations may induce high-level representational incoherence between one's own intentioned action and the perceived intention of others which, by uncoupling the dynamics of sensorimotor facilitation, could ultimately perturbe motor output.

N2  - Background: In our Dynamic Pathways, account, we hypothesized that childhood stuttering reflects an impairment in speech sensorimotor control that is conditioned by cognitive, linguistic, and emotional factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential differences in levels of sympathetic arousal during performance of speech and non-speech tasks between children who do and do not stutter. Methods: Seventy-two preschool-aged children participated in the study, 47 children who stutter (CWS; 38 boys) and 25 children who do not stutter (CWNS; 18 boys). We recorded skin conductance and blood pulse volume (BPV) signals, indices of sympathetic arousal, during higher/lower load speech tasks (structured sentence production and picture description) and non-speech tasks (jaw wagging and forceful blowing). We included a measure that reflects children’s attitudes about their communication skills and a parent-report assessment of temperament. Results: We found no significant differences between preschool CWS and CWNS in phasic skin conductance response amplitude or frequency, BPV, and pulse rate for any of the experimental tasks. However, compared to CWNS, CWS had, on average, significantly higher skin conductance levels (SCL), indexing slowly changing tonic sympathetic activity, across both speech and non-speech experimental conditions. We found distinctive task-related profiles of sympathetic arousal in both groups of preschool children. Most children produced the highest levels of sympathetic arousal in the physically demanding blowing task rather than in speech, as seen in previous studies of adults. We did not find differences in temperament between the two groups of preschool children nor a relationship among behavioral indices of temperament and communication attitude and physiological measures of sympathetic arousal. Conclusion: We did not find that atypically high, speech-related sympathetic arousal is a significant factor in early childhood stuttering. Rather, CWS had higher, on average, task-related tonic SCLs across speech and non-speech tasks. A relationship among behavioral measures of temperament and physiological measures of sympathetic arousal was not confirmed. Key questions for future experiments are how the typical coupling of sympathetic and speech sensorimotor systems develops over childhood and adolescence and whether task related developmental profiles follow a different course in children who continue to stutter.

N2  - The Central Sensitization (CSI) Inventory was introduced in 2012. It was initially intended as a screener to help identify when presenting symptoms may be related to central sensitization or indicate the presence of a central sensitivity syndrome. It has now been translated and validated in a number of European, Asian, and South American languages. This article provides an overview of CSI rationale, development, recommended uses, and research results, including evidence of validity and reliability, in clinical and non-clinical subject samples.

N2  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain (LBP) in Western Europe was classified as having the highest disability and overall burden among 291 studied conditions. For an extensive period of time, evidence related to morphological changes (eg, atrophy and fat infiltration) of the paraspinal muscles in persons with LBP has accumulated. Despite this evidence, there is limited knowledge on muscle fiber type composition of these muscles, and their relation to LBP. PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to investigate differences in muscle fiber type composition between persons with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) and healthy controls for the lumbar erector spinae (ES) and multifidus (MF) muscle. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study took place in the REVAL Rehabilitation Research Center, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty persons with NSCLBP (age: 44.5±7.42) and 18 healthy controls (age: 39.89±7.90) participated in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was paraspinal muscle fiber type composition. Secondary outcomes consisted of physiologic measures (maximal aerobic capacity and back muscle strength) and functional measures (activity level). METHODS: Biopsy samples were taken from the lumbar ES and MF muscle at the L4 spinal level. These samples were stained using immunofluorescent antibodies against myosin heavy chains. In each sample, number and size (CSA) of type I, I/IIa, IIa, IIa/x, and IIx muscle fibers were quantified. From these data the relative cross-sectional fiber areas (RCSA) were calculated. To analyze differences in fiber type composition between healthy persons and persons with NSCLBP, a repeated measurements analysis of variance was used. Secondary outcome measures were analyzed using a Student's t test, and Wilcoxon test. This study was supported by the research fund of Hasselt University without potential conflict of interest. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between both groups regarding anthropometric data. There were no significant between group differences for CSA in the ES. Persons with NSCLBP displayed a nonsignificant (p=.0978) increase in the number of type I muscle fibers, and a significant decrease (p=.0019) in the number of type IIx muscle fibers in the ES muscle. Persons with NSCLBP also displayed a trend toward a higher (p=.0596) RCSA for type I fibers and a significantly lower RCSA for type IIx fibers (p=.0411). There were no significant between group differences within the MF. Regarding the secondary outcome measures, there was a significant between group difference in activity level (p=.0004) and isokinetic back muscle strength (p=.0342). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine muscle fiber type characteristics in both the ES and MF muscle of persons with NSCLBP. Based on muscle fiber characteristics, the paraspinal muscles of persons with NSCLBP seems to display a larger oxidative potential based on an increase of the number type I fibers at the expense of type IIx glycolytic fibers.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: The lumbar paraspinal muscles, including the erector spinae and multifidus, play an important role in movement and control of the spine. However, our understanding of their contribution to low back pain and disability is unclear. Systematic reviews have reported conflicting evidence for an association between paraspinal muscle size and low back pain, and a paucity of data examining muscle cross-sectional area (CSA)and low back disability. PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between paraspinal muscle CSA and both low back pain intensity and disability. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: One-year longitudinal cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Participants were selected from the SpineData Registry (Denmark), which enrolls people with low back pain of 2 to 12 months duration without radiculopathy and a satisfactory response to primary intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Current, typical, and worst pain in the prior 2 weeks were assessed by 11-point numeric rating scales and an average pain score was calculated, and disability was measured using the 23-item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. CSA (cm 2 )of the lumbar paraspinal muscles was measured at levels L3–L5 from magnetic resonance images. METHODS: Participants completed the study questionnaires and underwent the lumbar spine magnetic resonance images at baseline and were followed up 12 months later to repeat the questionnaires. Statistical analyses involved multivariable linear regression (cross-sectional analysis)and linear mixed-models (longitudinal analysis)with adjustment for confounders. Multiple imputation was conducted to account for missing data. RESULTS: A total of 962 participants were included and 588 (65.8%)were followed up at 12-months. Multivariable analysis showed that greater paraspinal muscle CSA was associated with lower levels of disability, after adjusting for confounders (right mean CSA: baseline beta −0.16, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.06, p<.01; longitudinal beta −0.11, 95% CI −0.21 to −0.01, p=.03). This was evident at all levels, except L5 which was marginal at baseline (beta −0.08, 95% CI −0.15 to −0.001, p=.045)and not significant longitudinally (beta −0.05, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.02, p=.18). However, there were no associations between muscle CSA and pain intensity (baseline beta −0.02, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.02, p=.29; longitudinal beta −0.02, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.02, p=.34). Results were similar for both complete case and multiple imputation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study found an inverse relationship between lumbar paraspinal muscle CSA and low back disability, but not pain intensity. While further investigation is needed, these findings suggest that treatment strategies directed at increasing paraspinal muscle size may be effective in reducing low back disability.

N2  - Background: Sensitivity-related trait characteristics involving physical and emotional sensitivities and high trait anxiety personality types have been observed in individuals with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). High trait sensitivity to sensory stimulation combined with interpretation biases based on personality type may contribute to the development of central sensitization (CS) symptoms. To date, there is limited research that has considered both sensitivity levels and personality type in NSCLBP with CS. The purpose of this study was to investigate (1) relationships between trait sensory profiles, trait anxiety, and CS symptoms, and (2) the predictive capacity of sensory profiles, trait anxiety, and personality types on CS symptoms in people with NSCLBP. Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study using 4 self-report measures on adults (N = 165, mean age = 45 ± 12 [standard deviation] years) from physiotherapy clinics in England, Ireland, and New Zealand. Inclusion: NSCLBP > 6 months, age 18 to 64 years, predominant CS pain presentation, no other pathology. Parametric and nonparametric correlation statistics and regression analyses were used. Results: Positive correlations were found between central sensitization inventory (CSI) scores and sensory hypersensitivity profiles and trait anxiety. CSI score increases could be predicted by sensory-sensitive, low-registration profiles; trait anxiety scores; and extreme defensive high anxious personality type. Conclusions: Trait sensory hyper- and/or hyposensitivity and high trait anxiety–related personality type characteristics predict the extent of CS symptoms in people with NSCLBP. Further investigation is required to establish causality between these characteristics and CS symptoms.

N2  - The brain and body respond to potential and actual stressful events by activating hormonal and neural mediators and modifying behaviors to adapt. Such responses help maintain physiological stability (" allostasis" ). When behavioral or physiological stressors are frequent and/or severe, allostatic responses can become dysregulated and maladaptive (" allostatic load" ). Allostatic load may alter brain networks both functionally and structurally. As a result, the brain's responses to continued/subsequent stressors are abnormal, and behavior and systemic physiology are altered in ways that can, in a vicious cycle, lead to further allostatic load. Migraine patients are continually exposed to such stressors, resulting in changes to central and peripheral physiology and function. Here we review how changes in brain states that occur as a result of repeated migraines may be explained by a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model and how understanding migraine within the context of allostatic load model suggests alternative treatments for this often-debilitating disease. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Pain and stress share significant conceptual and physiological overlaps. Both phenomena challenge the body's homeostasis and necessitate decision-making to help animals adapt to their environment. In addition, chronic stress and chronic pain share a common behavioral model of failure to extinguish negative memories. Yet, they also have discrepancies such that the final brain endophenotype of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and chronic pain appears to be different among the three conditions, and the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis remains unclear in the physiology of pain. Persistence of either stress or pain is maladaptive and could lead to compromised well-being. In this brief review, we highlight the commonalities and differences between chronic stress and chronic pain, while focusing particularly on the central role of the limbic brain. We assess the current attempts in the field to conceptualize and understand chronic pain, within the context of knowledge gained from the stress literature. The limbic brain-including hippocampus, amygdala, and ventromedial pre-frontal cortex-plays a critical role in learning. These brain areas integrate incoming nociceptive or stress signals with internal state, and generate learning signals necessary for decision-making. Therefore, the physiological and structural remodeling of this learning circuitry is observed in conditions such as chronic pain, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder, and is also linked to the risk of onset of these conditions.

N2  - THE ELECTRODERMAL SYSTEM Overview Electrodermal activity (EDA), formerly called the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), has been one of the most widely used response systems in the history of psychophysiology. Research involving EDA has been reported in practically all areas of psychology, psychiatry, and psychophysiology. EDA measures have been applied to a wide variety of topics ranging from basic research examining attention, information processing, and emotion, to more applied clinical research examining predictors and/or correlates of normal and abnormal behavior. The application of EDA measures to a wide variety of issues is due in large part to its low cost, relative ease of measurement and quantification, combined with its sensitivity to psychological states and processes. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a tutorial overview of EDA for interested students, researchers, and practitioners who are not specialists in this particular system. We begin with a historical description of different methods of measuring EDA, and then discuss the physical, inferential, psychological, and social aspects of EDA. Historical Background and Measurement of EDA Exosomatic method There are two fundamentally different methods of measuring EDA: (1) the “exosomatic method” which relies on the application of a small external electrical current across the skin and (2) the “endosomatic method” which measures internally generated electrical skin potentials without application of an external event. Both types of measure were first found to be sensitive to psychological changes in the later part of the nineteenth century. The effect of psychological variables on the exosomatic measure of human EDA was demonstrated in the laboratory of Jean Charcot, the French neurologist famous for his work on hysteria and hypnosis (for interesting details see Neumann & Blanton, 1970; Bloch, 1993). Vigouroux (1879, 1888), a collaborator of Charcot, measured tonic skin resistance levels as a clinical diagnostic sign in patients with hysteria by passing a small electrical current across two electrodes placed on the surface of the skin. He reported that the skin resistance level changed from side to side of the body with changes in the side of the hysterical anesthesia. In the same laboratory, Féré (1888) found that skin resistance would momentarily decrease in response to a variety of discrete sensory stimuli (visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, etc.).

N2  - The basic underpinnings of homeostatic behavior include interacting with positive items and avoiding negative ones. As the planning aspects of goal-directed actions can be inferred from their movement features, we investigated the kinematics of interacting with emotion-laden stimuli. Participants were instructed to grasp emotion-laden stimuli and bring them toward their bodies while the kinematics of their wrist movement was measured. The results showed that the time to peak velocity increased for bringing pleasant stimuli towards the body compared to unpleasant and neutral ones, suggesting higher easiness in undertaking the task with pleasant stimuli. Furthermore, bringing unpleasant stimuli towards the body increased movement time in comparison with both pleasant and neutral ones while the time to peak velocity for unpleasant stimuli was the same as for that of neutral stimuli. There was no change in the trajectory length among emotional categories. We conclude that during the "reach-to-grasp" and "bring-to-the-body" movements, the valence of the stimuli affects the temporal but not the spatial kinematic features of motion. To the best of our knowledge, we show for the first time that the kinematic features of a goal-directed action are tuned by the emotional valence of the stimuli.

N2  - Emotions can evoke strong reactions that have profound influences, from gross changes in our internal environment to small fluctuations in facial muscles, and reveal our feelings overtly. Muscles contain proprioceptive afferents, informing us about our movements and regulating motor activities. Their firing reflects changes in muscle length, yet their sensitivity can be modified by the fusimotor system, as found in animals. In humans, the sensitivity of muscle afferents is modulated by cognitive processes, such as attention; however, it is unknown if emotional processes can modulate muscle feedback. Presently, we explored whether muscle afferent sensitivity adapts to the emotional situation. We recorded from single muscle afferents in the leg, using microneurography, and moved the ankle joint of participants, while they listened to evocative classical music to induce sad, neutral, or happy emotions, or sat passively (no music). We further monitored their physiological responses using skin conductance, heart rate, and electromyography measures. We found that muscle afferent firing was modified by the emotional context, especially for sad emotions, where the muscle spindle dynamic response increased. We suggest that this allows us to prime movements, where the emotional state prepares the body for consequent behaviour-appropriate reactions.

N2  - Background. In recent years, several published articles have demonstrated that quantitative sensory testing (QST) is useful in the analysis of musculoskeletal pain disorders. Based on the evidence from these studies, it is assumed that QST might be a useful tool in the analysis of the pathogenesis, classification, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Objectives. The objective of this paper is to discuss measurement properties of QSTand potentials research and clinical applications in musculoskeletal pain. Methods. This is a review of the current knowledge base on QST as it relates to musculoskeletal pain disorders. We based our summary on articles retrieved from Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to present) including EMBASE, AMED, and PsycINFO databases to search for all published literature focused on QST and musculoskeletal pain. Results. QST has been shown to be related to neural sensitivity in musculoskeletal pain. QST measurement properties have been evaluated for multiple sensory evaluation modalities and protocols with no clear superior instrument or test protocol. The research evidence is incomplete, but suggests potential clinical benefits for predicting outcomes and subtyping pain. Threshold detection testing is commonly used to quantify sensory loss or gain, in current practice and has shown moderate reliability. Intensity/magnitude rating can be assessed on a wide range of rating scales and may be more useful for pain rating in a clinical context. Threshold detection-based testing and intensity/magnitude rating-based testing can be combined to determine pain threshold in clinical evaluation. Conclusions. Musculoskeletal pain management may benefit from treatment algorithms that consider mechanism, pain quality, or neurophysiological correlates. Non-invasive QST may be helpful to find sensory array of altered nociceptive process. Due to the diverse etiopathogenetic basis of musculoskeletal pain disorders, a broad range of reliable and valid QST tests may be needed to analyze the various disease entities.

N2  - Low back pain (LBP) has been inconsistently associated with enhanced pronociceptive and impaired antinociceptive mechanisms. It remains unknown whether alterations are causal, consequential, or coincidental to pain presence. This study investigated pronociceptive and antinociceptive mechanisms in recurrent LBP (RLBP) patients across painful and pain-free periods, compared with age/sex-matched asymptomatic controls. During a painful episode (day 0) and when pain-free (day 28), 30 RLBP patients were assessed and compared with 30 controls over the same timeframe. Pressure pain thresholds were recorded bilaterally on the arm, back, and leg. Cuff algometry was used to assess cuff pressure pain detection threshold and cuff pain tolerance threshold on the lower legs, as well as temporal summation of pain (10 repeated painful cuff test stimuli on the dominant leg scored on a visual analogue scale) and conditioned pain modulation ([CPM]: cuff pain detection/tolerance threshold on dominant leg, before vs during painful cuff conditioning on the contralateral leg). Recurrent LBP patients displayed reduced pressure pain thresholds at the arm and back on day 0 compared with day 28 (P < 0.047) and with controls on day 0 (P < 0.049). Cuff pain detection threshold was reduced, and ratings of suprathreshold test stimuli were increased in RLBP patients on day 0 compared with day 28 (P < 0.02). Temporal summation of pain magnitude (increase in visual analogue scale scores) was enhanced in RLBP participants on day 0 compared with day 28 (P = 0.027) and with controls on day 0 (P = 0.039). Conditioned pain modulation magnitude (increased threshold during conditioning) was lower overall in RLBP participants than in controls (P = 0.021). Enhanced pronociceptive mechanisms were observed in RLBP patients. When pain-free, measures returned to similar levels as controls, except for CPM, which remained impaired.

N2  - Purpose: Evidence of intervertebral mechanical markers in chronic, non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) is lacking. This research used dynamic fluoroscopic studies to compare intervertebral angular motion sharing inequality and variability (MSI and MSV) during continuous lumbar motion in CNSLBP patients and controls. Passive recumbent and active standing protocols were used and the relationships of these variables to age and disc degeneration were assessed. Methods: Twenty patients with CNSLBP and 20 matched controls received quantitative fluoroscopic lumbar spine examinations using a standardised protocol for data collection and image analysis. Composite disc degeneration (CDD) scores comprising the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grades from L2–S1 were obtained. Indices of intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI) and variability (MSV) were derived and expressed in units of proportion of lumbar range of motion from outward and return motion sequences during lying (passive) and standing (active) lumbar bending and compared between patients and controls. Relationships between MSI, MSV, age and CDD were assessed by linear correlation. Results: MSI was significantly greater in the patients throughout the intervertebral motion sequences of recumbent flexion (0.29 vs. 0.22, p = 0.02) and when flexion, extension, left and right motion were combined to give a composite measure (1.40 vs. 0.92, p = 0.04). MSI correlated substantially with age (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) and CDD (R = 0.70, p = 0.03) in lying passive investigations in patients and not in controls. There were also substantial correlations between MSV and age (R = 0.77, p = 0.01) and CDD (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) in standing flexion in patients and not in controls. Conclusion: Greater inequality and variability of motion sharing was found in patients with CNSLBP than in controls, confirming previous studies and suggesting a biomechanical marker for the disorder at intervertebral level. The relationship between disc degeneration and MSI was augmented in patients, but not in controls during passive motion and similarly for MSV during active motion, suggesting links between in vivo disc mechanics and pain generation.

N2  - Introduction: Women with fibromyalgia (FM) have symptoms of increased muscular fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, which may be associated with alterations in muscle microcirculation and oxygen metabolism. This study used near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopies to noninvasively evaluate muscle blood flow, blood oxygenation and oxygen metabolism during leg fatiguing exercise and during arm arterial cuff occlusion in post-menopausal women with and without FM.Methods: Fourteen women with FM and twenty-three well-matched healthy controls participated in this study. For the fatiguing exercise protocol, the subject was instructed to perform 6 sets of 12 isometric contractions of knee extensor muscles with intensity steadily increasing from 20 to 70% maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). For the cuff occlusion protocol, forearm arterial blood flow was occluded via a tourniquet on the upper arm for 3 minutes. Leg or arm muscle hemodynamics, including relative blood flow (rBF), oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([HbO2] and [Hb]), total hemoglobin concentration (THC) and blood oxygen saturation (StO2), were continuously monitored throughout protocols using a custom-built hybrid diffuse optical instrument that combined a commercial near-infrared oximeter for tissue oxygenation measurements and a custom-designed diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) flowmeter for tissue blood flow measurements. Relative oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) and oxygen consumption rate (rVO2) were calculated from the measured blood flow and oxygenation data. Post-manipulation (fatiguing exercise or cuff occlusion) recovery in muscle hemodynamics was characterized by the recovery half-time, a time interval from the end of manipulation to the time that tissue hemodynamics reached a half-maximal value.Results: Subjects with FM had similar hemodynamic and metabolic response/recovery patterns as healthy controls during exercise and during arterial occlusion. However, tissue rOEF during exercise in subjects with FM was significantly lower than in healthy controls, and the half-times of oxygenation recovery (Δ[HbO2] and Δ[Hb]) were significantly longer following fatiguing exercise and cuff occlusion.Conclusions: Our results suggest an alteration of muscle oxygen utilization in the FM population. This study demonstrates the potential of using combined diffuse optical spectroscopies (i.e., NIRS/DCS) to comprehensively evaluate tissue oxygen and flow kinetics in skeletal muscle. © 2012 Shang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: Deep tissue hypoxia has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS 1) for some patients. The purpose of this study was to determine if near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) could detect differences in deep tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and microcirculatory function in the hands of patients with CRPS 1. Methods: Tissue oxygen saturation was evaluated at baseline and during an ischemia reperfusion challenge using vascular occlusion testing (VOT) in affected vs unaffected hands of patients with unilateral upper limb CRPS 1. A non-randomized experimental study design was used with baseline StO2 as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were occlusion and reperfusion slopes from VOT. Values were compared with the unaffected, contralateral hand and with the dominant and non-dominant hands of sex and age-matched volunteers. Correlations between values derived from NIRS and measures of pain and function from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires were explored. Results: Independent of handedness, the baseline StO2 of the affected hands of ten CRPS 1 patients was significantly lower than that of their unaffected hands (-5.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.6 to -1.0; P = 0.02). The baseline StO2 of affected CRPS 1 hands was also significantly lower than the non-dominant hands of ten volunteers (-7.3%; 95% CI -12.4 to -2.3; P = 0.007). Differences in VOT occlusion and reperfusion slopes did not reveal changes that could be uniquely attributed to CRPS 1. No significant correlations were detected between values derived from VOT and values for pain and function obtained from BPI and DASH questionnaires for patients with CRPS 1. Conclusions: Hands of patients affected by CRPS 1 of the upper limb showed significantly lower StO2 compared with their unaffected contralateral hand as well as the hands of control subjects.

N2  - We tested hypotheses of (a) reduced oxygen usage, oxygen recovery, blood flow and oxygen consumption; and (b) increased muscle activity for patients diagnosed with work-related muscle pain (WRMP) in comparison to healthy controls. Oxygenation was measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and muscle activity with EMG for the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and trapezius descendens (TD) muscles. Eighteen patients with diffuse neck-shoulder-arm pain and 17 controls (matched in age and sex) were equipped with NIRS and EMG probes. After determining an individual's maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force, short-term (20 s) isometric contractions for the ECR and TD of 10, 30, 50 and 70 % MVC generated †StO2 and StO2% recovery (Rslope) from NIRS, and RMS%max from EMG signals. In addition, upper arm venous (VO) and arterial (AO) occlusions generated slopes of total hemoglobin (HbTslope) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHbslope) for the resting ECR as surrogates of blood flow and oxygen consumption, respectively. Mixed model analyses, t tests, and Mann-Whitney test were used to assess differences between groups. There was no significant difference in MVC between groups for either muscle. Also, †StO2%, Rslope for either muscle, and ECR-HbTslope were not different between groups, thus our hypotheses of reduced oxygen use, recovery, and blood flow for patients were not confirmed. However, patients had a significantly lower ECR-HHbslope confirming our hypothesis of reduced consumption. Further, there was no difference in RMS%max during contractions meaning that the hypothesis of increased activity for patients was not confirmed. When taking into account the number of NIRS variables studied, differences we found between our patient group and healthy controls (i.e., in forearm oxygen consumption and shoulder oxygen saturation level) may be considered modest. Overall our findings may have been impacted by the fact that our patients and controls were similar in muscle strength, which is in contrast to previous studies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The present study was designed to examine (1) whether there are vasodilator fibres in the masseter muscle, and (2) if there are, to establish the neural pathways mediating these responses in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the lingual nerve (LN) elicited intensity- and frequency-dependent increases of the blood flow in the masseter muscle (MBF) and lower lip (LBF). Increases in both the MBF and LBF evoked by the LN stimulation were reduced by hexamethonium in a dose-dependent manner (1-10 mg kg-1). Pretreatment with phentolamine or propranolol at a dose of 100 μg kg-1 had no effect on the increases in either MBF or LBF evoked by LN stimulation. Pretreatment with atropine (100 μg kg-1) significantly reduced the MBF increase induced by LN stimulation, but not that in the LBF. The sectioning of the superior cervical sympathetic trunk did not affect the responses. MBF increases occurred with electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion, and these increases were significantly reduced by the administration of hexamethonium and atropine. Lidocaine microinjection into the trigeminal spinal nucleus or salivatory nuclei caused a significant attenuation of the LN-induced MBF increases. When wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into the masseter muscle, labelled neurones were abundantly observed in the otic ganglion. The present study indicates that there are parasympathetic cholinergic and noncholinergic vasodilator fibres originating from cell bodies in the otic ganglion in the rat masseter muscle. The MBF increase evoked by activation of the parasympathetic fibres occurred via the trigeminal mediated reflex, suggesting that the novel parasympathetic vasodilator response may play an important role in the regulation of the haemodynamics of jaw muscles. © The Physiological Society 2005.

N2  - The present study was designed to examine the effect of sympathetic tonic activity on parasympathetic vasodilation evoked by the trigeminal-mediated reflex in the masseter muscle in urethane-anesthetized rats. Sectioning of the superior cervical sympathetic trunk (CST) ipsilaterally increased the basal level of blood flow in the masseter muscle (MBF). Electrical stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the CST for 2 min using 2-ms pulses ipsilaterally decreased in a dependent manner the intensity (0.5-10 V) and frequency (0.1-5 Hz) of the MBF. The CST stimulation for 2 min at <0.5 Hz with 5 V using 2-ms pulses seems to be comparable with the spontaneous activity in the CST fibers innervating the masseter vasculature, because this stimulation restored the basal level of the MBF to the presectioned values. Parasympathetic vasodilation evoked by electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the lingual nerve in the masseter muscle was markedly reduced by CST stimulation for 2 min with 5 V using 2-ms pulses in a frequency-dependent manner (0.5-5 Hz). Intravenous administration of phentolamine significantly reduced the vasoconstriction induced by CST stimulation in a dosedependent manner (0.1-1 mg/kg), but pretreatment with either phentolamine or propranolol failed to affect the sympathetic inhibition of the parasympathetic vasodilation. Our results suggest that 1) excess sympathetic activity inhibits parasympathetic vasodilation in the masseter muscle, and 2) α- and β-adrenoceptors do not contribute to sympathetic inhibition of parasympathetic vasodilation, and thus some other types of receptors must be involved in this response.

N2  - Patients suffering from work-related muscle pain (WRMP) fatigue earlier during exercise than healthy controls. Inadequate oxygen consumption and/or inadequate blood supply can influence the ability of the muscles to withstand fatigue. However, it remains unknown if oxygenation and hemodynamics are associated with early fatigue in muscles of WRMP patients. In the present study we applied near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and trapezius (TD) muscles of patients with WRMP (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 17). Our objective was to determine if there were group differences in endurance times for a low-level contraction of 15% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) - sustained for 12-13 min, and to see if these differences were associated with differences in muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics. At baseline, oxygen saturation (StO2%) was similar between groups for the ECR, but StO2% was significantly lower for TD for the WRMP patients (76%) compared to controls (85%) (P<0.01). Also, baseline ECR blood flow was similar in the two groups. For both muscles there were a larger number of patients, compared to controls, that did not maintain the 15% MVC for the allotted time. Consequently, the endurance times were significantly shorter for the WRMP patients than controls (medians, ECR: 347 s vs. 582 s; TD: 430 s vs. 723 s respectively). Responses in StO2% during the contractions were not significantly different between groups for either muscle, i.e. no apparent difference in oxygen consumption. Overall, we interpret our findings to indicate that the early fatigue for our WRMP patients was not associated with muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics. © 2014 Elcadi et al.

N2  - Background: Objective measures of pain severity remain ill defined, although its accurate measurement is critical. Reciprocal baroreflex mechanisms of blood pressure (BP) control were found to impact differently on pain regulation, and thus their asymmetry was hypothesized to also connect to chronic pain duration and severity. Methods: Seventy-eight female patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 27 healthy women were assessed for IBS severity and chronicity, negative affect, and various measures of resting autonomic function including BP, heart rate and its variability (HRV), baroreceptor-sensitivity to activations and inhibitions, gains of brady- and tachy-cardiac baro-responses, gains of BP falls/rises, and BP start points for these spontaneous baroreflexes. Key Results: IBS directly and indirectly (through increased negative affect) was associated with asymmetry between baroreceptor activations/inhibitions compared to symmetrical baroreflex reciprocity in the healthy women. In the IBS group, independently of specific IBS symptoms, pain chronicity was associated with (i) decreased BP falls coupled with either (a) decreased tachycardia associated with lower disease severity (earlier “pain resilience” mechanism), or (b) decreased bradycardia associated with higher disease severity (later “pain decompensation” mechanism), or (ii) increased BP start point for baroreceptor activations coupled with either (a) BP increase (delayed “pain adaptation” mechanism) or (b) affect-related HRV decrease (delayed “pain aggravation” mechanism). Conclusion and Inferences: We anticipate the findings to be a starting point for validating these autonomic metrics of pain suffering and pain coping mechanisms in other chronic pain syndromes to suggest them as biomarkers of its severity and duration for profiling and correct management of chronic pain patients.

N2  - The nociceptive and the autonomic nervous systems interact at the levels of the periphery, spinal cord, brainstem, and forebrain. Spinal and visceral afferents provide converging information to spinothalamic neurons in the dorsal horn and to neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius and parabrachial nuclei. These structures project to areas involved in reflex, homeostatic and behavioral control of autonomic outflow and nociception. Clinical and experimental observations on migraine suggest that a general hyperexcitability could develop along nociceptive trigeminal neurons allowing the activation of descending pathways that facilitate pain processing or the suppression of pathways that slow down pain transmission. Slowly progressive dysfunction of central pain systems secondary to the repetition of attacks of the originating headache has been implicated in transforming the process from an episodic to a chronic condition. This concept of an irritable focus in the central nervous system is currently known as "central sensitization" and is a characteristic feature of visceral pain. Considering primary headache as the result of the interactions between the nociceptive and autonomic systems (visceral pain) can help us to understand the complex pathophysiology of these disorders and to explore new treatments.

N2  - Acute pain triggers adaptive physiological responses that serve as protective mechanisms that prevent continuing damage to tissues and cause the individual to react to remove or escape the painful stimulus. However, an extension of the pain response beyond signaling tissue damage and healing, such as in chronic pain states, serves no particular biological function; it is maladaptive. The increasing number of chronic pain sufferers is concerning, and the associated disease burden is putting healthcare systems around the world under significant pressure. The incapacitating effects of long-lasting pain are not just psychological - reflexes driven by nociceptors during the establishment of chronic pain may cause serious physiological consequences on regulation of other body systems. The sympathetic nervous system is inherently involved in a host of physiological responses evoked by noxious stimulation. Experimental animal and human models demonstrate a diverse array of heterogeneous reactions to nociception. The purpose of this review is to understand how pain affects the sympathetic nervous system by investigating the reflex cardiovascular and neural responses to acute pain and the long-lasting physiological responses to prolonged (tonic) pain. By observing the sympathetic responses to long-lasting pain, we can begin to understand the physiological consequences of long-term pain on cardiovascular regulation.

N2  - Background: Recent preclinical work strongly suggests that vagus nerve stimulation efficiently modulates nociception and pain processing in humans. Most recently, a medical device has offered a transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (t-VNS) without any surgery. Objective: Our study investigates whether t-VNS may have the potential to alter pain processing using a controlled design. Methods: Different submodalities of the somatosensory system were assessed with quantitative sensory testing (QST) including a tonic heat pain paradigm in 48 healthy volunteers. Each subject participated in two experimental sessions with active t-VNS (stimulation) or sham t-VNS (no stimulation) on different days in a randomized order (crossed-over). One session consisted of two QST measurements on the ipsi- and contralateral hand, each before and during 1 h of a continuous t-VNS on the left ear using rectangular pulses (250 μS, 25 Hz). Results: We found an increase of mechanical and pressure pain threshold and a reduction of mechanical pain sensitivity. Moreover, active t-VNS significantly reduced pain ratings during sustained application of painful heat for 5 min compared to sham condition. No relevant alterations of cardiac or breathing activity or clinical relevant side effects were observed during t-VNS. Conclusions: Our findings of a reduced sensitivity of mechanically evoked pain and an inhibition of temporal summation of noxious tonic heat in healthy volunteers may pave the way for future studies on patients with chronic pain addressing the potential analgesic effects of t-VNS under clinical conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Owing to the recent interest in torso stabilization exercises together with many questions regarding the duration of prolonged isometric holds in occupational settings, the authors attempted to assess the level of back muscle oxygenation during prolonged isometric contractions. Specifically, this study recorded relative oxygen saturation of haemoglobin/myoglobin using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in the L3 erector mass during prolonged isometric contractions at intensities from 2 to 30% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). It was hypothesized that available oxygen to these muscles is severely compromised even at moderate levels of activation observed in occupational work. Eight volunteers without a history of lower back pain or injury participated in this study. The exercise task involved isometric contraction of the lower erector spinae at five different levels of each subject's maximal voluntary contraction: 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30% MVC, presented in random order. Subjects were placed in a sitting position, with a curved plastic plate secured horizontally to the pelvis to minimize movement at the hip joint. During extensor exertions, they were restrained with a harness that was attached at chest level to a load cell. Each isometric contraction was performed for 30 s followed by 1 min of rest. All levels of contraction demonstrated reduction in oxygen. Given the concern for motion artefact on the NIRS signal, sham trials were conducted where the subjects went through the procedure of attaching the pulling cable but no active pull was performed. These trials showed no change in the NIRS signal. At this time NIRS appears to be the only non-invasive instrumentation available to indicate total available muscle oxygen during low level, prolonged work. Although the specific tissue volume sampled by NIRS cannot be positively identified, it appears that tissue oxygenation in the lumbar extensor musculature is reduced as a function of contraction intensity, even at levels as low as 2% of MVC. These data have implications for prolonged work where postures requiring isometric contractions are sometimes held for hours, and where musculoskeletal illness has been linked to prolonged contraction levels above 2% MVC—these data suggest a possible biological pathway. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - The purposes of this study were to: (1) compare the muscle blood volume (Mbv) and oxygenation (Mox) responses on the right and left side erector spinae during the Biering-Sorensen muscle endurance (BSME) test between healthy, low back pain active (LBP-A) and LBP-sedentary (LBP-S) subjects using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and (2) determine the relationships between the BSME time and Mbv and Mox. Informed consent was obtained from 30 healthy and 30 chronic LBP subjects. The latter group was subdivided into an active (LBP-A; n=18) and sedentary (LBP-S; n=12) subgroups based on physical activity patterns. The groups were age and sex matched. The NIRS probes were placed bilaterally on the erector spinae muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae. The testing protocol was: 2-min resting baseline, BSME to voluntary fatigue, and 4-min recovery. During the BSME Mbv immediately increased for ∼30 - 60 s, then showed an asymptote, and a steady decline towards the baseline at termination. Mox demonstrated either an initial increase followed by a systematic decrease until the termination of the BSME, or a systematic decrease throughout the BSME until termination. The LBP-S subjects showed a reduced Mox-range and slower Mox recovery time on the left side suggesting a reduced aerobic capacity of the erector spinae muscle in this group. Significant correlations were noted between BSME time and the pooled values of Mox-delta and-range only in the LBP-A group. These observations suggest that factors other than erector spinae aerobic capacity can influence BSME performance. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

N2  - Work-related physical activity (PA), in terms of peak loads and sustained and/or repetitive contractions, presents risk factors for the development of muscular pain and disorders. However, PA as a training tailored to the employee's work exposure, health, and physical capacity offers prevention and rehabilitation. We suggest the concept of "Intelligent Physical Exercise Training" relying on evidence-based sports science training principles.

N2  - The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess changes in myalgic trapezius activation, muscle oxygenation, and pain intensity during repetitive and stressful work tasks in response to 10 weeks of training. In total, 39 women with a clinical diagnosis of trapezius myalgia were randomly assigned to: (1) general fitness training performed as leg-bicycling (GFT); (2) specific strength training of the neck/shoulder muscles (SST) or (3) reference intervention without physical exercise. Electromyographic activity (EMG), tissue oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy), and pain intensity were measured in trapezius during pegboard and stress tasks before and after the intervention period. During the pegboard task, GFT improved trapezius oxygenation from a relative decrease of -0.83 ± 1.48 μM to an increase of 0.05 ± 1.32 μM, and decreased pain development by 43%, but did not affect resting levels of pain. SST lowered the relative EMG amplitude by 36%, and decreased pain during resting and working conditions by 52 and 38%, respectively, without affecting trapezius oxygenation. In conclusion, GFT performed as leg-bicycling decreased pain development during repetitive work tasks, possibly due to improved oxygenation of the painful muscles. SST lowered the overall level of pain both during rest and work, possibly due to a lowered relative exposure as evidenced by a lowered relative EMG. The results demonstrate differential adaptive mechanisms of contrasting physical exercise interventions on chronic muscle pain at rest and during repetitive work tasks. © 2011 The Author(s).

N2  - The aim of this investigation was to study female workers active in the labour market for differences between those with trapezius myalgia (MYA) and without (CON) during repetitive pegboard (PEG) and stress (STR) tasks regarding (1) relative muscle load, (2) trapezius muscle blood flow, (3) metabolite accumulation, (4) oxygenation, and (5) pain development. Among 812 female employees (age 30-60 years) at 7 companies with high prevalence of neck/shoulder complaints, clinical examination identified 43 MYA and 19 CON. At rest, during PEG, and STR the trapezius muscle was measured using (1) EMG and MMG, (2) microdialysis, and (3) NIRS. Further, subjective pain ratings were scored (VAS). EMGrms in %MVE (Maximal Voluntary EMG-activity), was significantly higher among MYA than CON during PEG (11.74 ± 9.09 vs. 7.42 ± 5.56%MVE) and STR (5.47 ± 5.00 vs. 3.28 ± 1.94%MVE). MANOVA showed a group and time effect regarding data from the microdialysis: for MYA versus CON group differences demonstrated lower muscle blood flow and higher lactate and pyruvate concentrations. Potassium and glucose only showed time effects. NIRS showed similar initial decreases in oxygenation with PEG in both groups, but only in CON a significant increase back to baseline during PEG. VAS score at rest was highest among MYA and increased during PEG, but not for CON. The results showed significant differences between CON and MYA regarding muscle metabolism at rest and with PEG and STR. Higher relative muscle load during PEG and STR, insufficient muscle blood flow and oxygenation may account for the higher lactate, pyruvate and pain responses among MYA versus CON. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Purpose: Exposure to additional environmental stress during computer work, such as visual and psychological demands, is associated with increased eye and neck discomfort, altered moods, and reduced well-being. The aim of this study is to elucidate further how subjective responses in healthy, young females with normal binocular vision are affected by glare and psychological stress during computer work, and to investigate possible associations between trapezius muscle blood flow and neck pain development. Methods: 43 females participated in a laboratory experiment with a within-subject design. Four 10-min computer work conditions with exposure to different stressors were performed at an ergonomically optimal workstation, under the following series of conditions: no additional stress, visual stress (induced as direct glare from a large glare source), psychological stress, and combined visual and psychological stress. Before and immediately after each computer work condition, questionnaires regarding different visual and eye symptoms, neck and shoulder symptoms, positive and negative state moods, perceived task difficulty, and perceived ambient lighting were completed. Associations between neck pain and trapezius muscle blood flow were also investigated. Results: Exposure to direct glare induced greater development of visual/eye symptoms and discomfort, while psychological stress exposure made participants feel more negative and stressed. The perception of work lighting during glare exposure was closely related to perceived stress, and associations between visual discomfort and eyestrain, and neck pain were observed in all conditions. Furthermore, participants with high trapezius muscle blood flow overall reported more neck pain, independent of exposure. Conclusions: Exposure to visual and psychological stresses during computer work affects the development of symptoms and negative moods in healthy, young females with normal binocular vision, but in different ways. The results also demonstrate the complex interactions involved in symptom development and lighting appraisal during computer work. When optimizing computer workstations, the complexity of the field must be taken into account, and several factors, including visual conditions, must be considered carefully.

N2  - Introduction: Several studies have demonstrated improvement in low back pain (LBP) after decompression surgery for lower extremity symptoms in lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS); however, the influence of neuropathic disorders on LBP is uncertain. Aim of this study is to identify the features of motion-induced and walking-induced LBP in patients with LSS and to assess whether neuropathic LBP develops. Methods: In total, 234 patients with LSS including L4/5 lesion were asked to identify their LBP. Subjects were classified into three groups: walking-induced LBP that aggravated during walking (W group), motion-induced LBP that aggravated during sitting up (M group), and no LBP (N group). Cross-sectional areas of the dural sac, lumbar multifidus, and the erector spinae were measured. Intramuscular oxygenation was evaluated with near-infrared spectrophotometer. Surface electromyography (EMG) and mechanomyography (MMG) were performed on the lumbar multifidus. Morphological, hemodynamic, and electrophysiological differences in the onset of LBP were evaluated. Results: The prevalence of W, M, and control groups was 31.2%, 32.1%, 36.8%, respectively. Concordance between the laterality of LBP and leg symptoms including pain and numbness was 86.3% in the W group and 47.0% in the M group. Dural sac area was lower in the W group than in the M and control groups. In the hemodynamic evaluation, the oxygenated hemoglobin level was significantly lower in the W group than in the M and N groups. In electrophysiological evaluation of lumbar multifidus, the mean power frequency in EMG was significantly higher in the W group than in the N group. Amplitude in MMG was significantly lower in the W group than in the N group. Conclusions: Neurologic disturbance in patients with LSS may be attributed to “neuropathic LBP.” Neuropathic multifidus disorder plays a role in walking-induced LBP.

N2  - The effects of work strategy and a rest condition on the physiological changes of the erector spinae muscle were studied. Eleven volunteers repeated fatiguing static contractions of holding an industrial box in 30° trunk flexion for a repetition of 12 times interrupted by rests for which the duration was equal to the duration of each preceding contraction. Each contraction was stopped at two fatigue sensation levels; moderate or strong, which corresponded to Borg's CR-10 3 and 5, as the work strategy conditions. The repeated contractions were performed for a total of eight conditions combined with the two rest conditions, with and without stretch exercise, and two contraction levels of 10 and 40% maximum pulling force in flexed posture (MVC) on separate days. Near-infrared spectroscopy and surface electromyography (EMG) were recorded. Amplitude and median frequency (MF) of EMG, oxy-hemoglobin, and deoxy-hemoglobin were calculated. MF related to fatigue sensation most closely. Oxy-hemoglobin decreased during each contraction. It, however, increased with repetition especially at 10% MVC and the increase was interpreted as adaptation to the work. The effect of the work strategy and the rest conditions was weak. MF decreased more in a strong work strategy condition than in a moderate one. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - There are bi-directional interactions between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and pain. This is likely underpinned by a substantial overlap between brain areas of the central autonomic network and areas involved in pain processing and modulation. To date, however, relatively little is known about the neuronal substrates of the ANS-pain association. Here, we acquired resting state fMRI scans in 21 healthy subjects at rest and during tonic noxious cold stimulation. As indicators of autonomic function, we examined how heart rate variability (HRV) frequency measures were influenced by tonic noxious stimulation and how these variables related to participants' pain perception and to brain functional connectivity in regions known to play a role in both ANS regulation and pain perception, namely the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Our findings support a role of the cardiac ANS in brain connectivity during pain, linking functional connections of the dACC and PAG with measurements of low frequency (LF)-HRV. In particular, we identified a three-way relationship between the ANS, cortical brain networks known to underpin pain processing, and participants' subjectively reported pain experiences. LF-HRV both at rest and during pain correlated with functional connectivity between the seed regions and other cortical areas including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left anterior insula (AI), and the precuneus. Our findings link cardiovascular autonomic parameters to brain activity changes involved in the elaboration of nociceptive information, thus beginning to elucidate underlying brain mechanisms associated with the reciprocal relationship between autonomic and pain-related systems.

N2  - The aim of this review was to examine the mechanisms by which physical activity and inactivity modify muscle fatigue. It is well known that acute or chronic increases in physical activity result in structural, metabolic, hormonal, neural, and molecular adaptations that increase the level of force or power that can be sustained by a muscle. These adaptations depend on the type, intensity, and volume of the exercise stimulus, but recent studies have highlighted the role of high intensity, short-duration exercise as a time-efficient method to achieve both anaerobic and aerobic/endurance type adaptations.The factors that determine the fatigue profile of a muscle during intense exercise include muscle fiber composition, neuromuscular characteristics, high energy metabolite stores, buffering capacity, ionic regulation, capillarization, and mitochondrial density. Muscle fiber-type transformation during exercise training is usually toward the intermediate type IIA at the expense of both type I and IIx myosin heavy-chain isoforms. High-intensity training results in increases of both glycolytic and oxidative enzymes, muscle capillarization, improved phosphocreatine resynthesis and regulation of K +, H +, and lactate ions. Decreases of the habitual activity level due to injury or sedentary lifestyle result in partial or even compete reversal of the adaptations due to previous training, manifested by reductions in fiber cross-sectional area, decreased oxidative capacity, and capillarization. Complete immobilization due to injury results in markedly decreased force output and fatigue resistance. Muscle unloading reduces electromyographic activity and causes muscle atrophy and significant decreases in capillarization and oxidative enzymes activity. The last part of the review discusses the beneficial effects of intermittent high-intensity exercise training in patients with different health conditions to demonstrate the powerful effect of exercise on health and well being. © 2012 Bogdanis.

N2  - This review focuses on how blood flow to contracting skeletal muscles is regulated during exercise in humans. The idea is that blood flow to the contracting muscles links oxygen in the atmosphere with the contracting muscles where it is consumed. In this context, we take a top down approach and review the basics of oxygen consumption at rest and during exercise in humans, how these values change with training, and the systemic hemodynamic adaptations that support them. We highlight the very high muscle blood flow responses to exercise discovered in the 1980s. We also discuss the vasodilating factors in the contracting muscles responsible for these very high flows. Finally, the competition between demand for blood flow by contracting muscles and maximum systemic cardiac output is discussed as a potential challenge to blood pressure regulation during heavy large muscle mass or whole body exercise in humans. At this time, no one dominant dilator mechanism accounts for exercise hyperemia. Additionally, complex interactions between the sympathetic nervous system and the microcirculation facilitate high levels of systemic oxygen extraction and permit just enough sympathetic control of blood flow to contracting muscles to regulate blood pressure during large muscle mass exercise in humans.

N2  - Objectives: Atherosclerosis can obstruct branching arteries of the abdominal aorta, including four paired lumbar arteries and the middle sacral artery that feed the lumbar spine. The diminished blood flow could result in various back problems. The aim of this systematic literature review was to assess associations between atherosclerosis and disc degeneration (DD) or low-back pain (LBP). Data sources: A systematic search of the Medline/PubMed database for all original articles on atherosclerosis and DD/LBP published until October 2008. The search was performed with the medical subject headings atherosclerosis, cardiovascular risk factor, or vascular disease and keywords "disc degeneration", "disc herniation", and "back pain" on the basis of MeSH tree and as a text search. In addition reference lists were studied and searched manually. Observational studies investigating the association of atherosclerosis or its risk factors and lumbar DD/LBP were selected. Review methods: The following data were extracted: study characteristics, duration of follow-up, year of publication, findings of atherosclerosis/cardiovascular risk factors and DD/LBP. Disc herniation was regarded as a form of disc degeneration and cardiovascular risk factors were regarded as surrogate for atherosclerosis in epidemiological studies. Results: One hundred and seventy-nine papers were identified. After exclusion of case reports, letters, editorials, papers not related to the lumbar spine, and animal studies, 25 papers were included. Post-mortem studies showed an association between atheromatous lesions in the aorta and DD, as well as between occluded lumbar arteries and life-time LBP. In clinical studies, aortic calcification was associated with LBP, and stenosis of lumbar arteries was associated with both DD and LBP. In epidemiological studies, smoking and high serum cholesterol levels were found to have the most consistent associations with DD and LBP. Conclusion: Aortic atherosclerosis and stenosis of the feeding arteries of the lumbar spine were associated with DD and LBP. Cardiovascular risk factors had weaker associations, being clearly apparent only in cohorts on elderly people or in large study samples. More prospective clinical studies are needed to further clarify the association of atherosclerosis and low-back disorders. © 2009 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

N2  - The regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen delivery to contracting skeletal muscle is complex and involves the mechanical effects of muscle contraction; local metabolic, red blood cell and endothelium-derived substances; and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). With advancing age in humans, skeletal muscle blood flow is typically reduced during dynamic exercise and this is due to a lower vascular conductance, which could ultimately contribute to age-associated reductions in aerobic exercise capacity, a primary predictor of mortality in both healthy and diseased ageing populations. Recent findings have highlighted the contribution of endothelium-derived substances to blood flow control in contracting muscle of older adults. With advancing age, impaired nitric oxide availability due to scavenging by reactive oxygen species, in conjunction with elevated vasoconstrictor signalling via endothelin-1, reduces the local vasodilatory response to muscle contraction. Additionally, ageing impairs the ability of contracting skeletal muscle to blunt sympathetic vasoconstriction (i.e. 'functional sympatholysis'), which is critical for the proper regulation of tissue blood flow distribution and oxygen delivery, and could further reduce skeletal muscle perfusion during high intensity and/or large muscle mass exercise in older adults. We propose that initiation of endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization is the underlying signalling event necessary to properly modulate sympathetic vasoconstriction in contracting muscle, and that age-associated impairments in red blood cell adenosine triphosphate release and stimulation of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation may explain impairments in both local vasodilatation and functional sympatholysis with advancing age in humans.

N2  - Chronic pain, when not effectively treated, is a leading health and socioeconomic problem and has a harmful effect on all aspects of health-related quality of life. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of how pain transitions from the acute to chronic phase is essential for developing effective novel analgesics. Accumulated evidence has shown that the transition from acute to chronic pain is determined by a cellular signaling switch called hyperalgesic priming, which occurs in primary nociceptive afferents. The hyperalgesic priming is triggered by inflammatory mediators and is involved in a signal switch from protein kinase A (PKA) to protein kinase Cε (PKCε) located in both isolectin B4 (IB4)-positive (nonpeptidergic) and IB4-negative (peptidergic) nociceptors. Acidosis may be the decisive factor regulating the PKA-to-PKCε signal switch in a proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor-dependent manner. Protons can also induce the hyperalgesic priming in IB4-negative muscle nociceptors in a PKCε-independent manner. Acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) and transient receptor potential/vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1) are 2 major acid sensors involved in the proton-induced hyperalgesic priming. The proton-induced hyperalgesic priming in muscle afferents can be prevented by a substance P-mediated signaling pathway. In this review, we summarize the factors that modulate hyperalgesic priming in both IB4-positive and IB4-negative nociceptors and discuss the role of acid signaling in inflammatory and noninflammatory pain as well as orofacial muscle pain.

N2  - Background: Intramuscular injection of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) may influence the responsiveness of active chemo-sensitive channels affecting muscle pain sensitivity. This double-blinded crossover study in healthy humans assessed contraction-evoked pain responses and pain sensitivity during acute ischaemia in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle before and 24 hr after five distributed NGF injections (1 µg, 4 cm interval) compared with control injections (isotonic-saline). Methods: Twenty-one subjects participated in two experimental phases, each including five sessions over 7 days, with a gap of 4 weeks in-between. Muscle pain intensity evoked with daily functional tasks (Likert scale score) was collected using a paper diary. Pain intensity evoked by ischaemic and non-ischaemic contractions numerical rating scale (NRS) was collected at Day0 and Day1. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) on the TA were recorded before (Day0), 3 hr, 1, 3, and 7 days post-injection, and after the ischaemic-contractions and post-cuff deflation at Day0 and Day1. Results: Increased Likert scores of pain were present for 7 days after NGF compared to control injections (p <.05). Higher NRS pain scores of ischaemic-contractions were seen when contracting the muscle injected with NGF compared to baseline (p =.003) and control (p =.012). Pain during non-ischaemic contractions was not significantly affected by NGF injections. Decreased PPTs were found at 3 hr, Day1 and Day3 post-injection (p <.05) in both conditions. Compared with pre-contractions, PPTs were increased following ischaemic contractions at Day0 (p <.05) and Day1 (p <.05) in both conditions. Conclusion: This study showed that ischaemic contraction-evoked pain was facilitated in an NGF-sensitized muscle. Significance: Acidification of the muscle environment may affect muscle nociceptors and pain by different mechanisms, including activation of ASIC3 and TRPV1. In this study, pain evoked following ischaemic contractions was increased in the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)-sensitized muscle compared with non-ischaemic contractions and in the non-sensitized muscle. These findings illustrate that responses of peripheral afferents under ischaemic conditions are altered by a pre-sensitized muscle. This highlights the role of growth factors, including NGF, in peripheral muscle sensitization with clinical implications for ischaemic myalgia.

N2  - The distribution of blood flow to skeletal muscle during exercise is altered with advancing age. Changes in arteriolar function that are muscle specific underlie age-induced changes in blood flow distribution. With advancing age, functional adaptations that occur in resistance arterioles from oxidative muscles differ from those that occur in glycolytic muscles. Age-related adaptations of morphology, as well as changes in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle signalling, differ in muscle of diverse fibre type. Age-induced endothelial dysfunction has been reported in most skeletal muscle arterioles; however, unique alterations in signalling contribute to the dysfunction in arterioles from oxidative muscles as compared with those from glycolytic muscles. In resistance arterioles from oxidative muscle, loss of nitric oxide signalling contributes significantly to endothelial dysfunction, whereas in resistance arterioles from glycolytic muscle, alterations in both nitric oxide and prostanoid signalling underlie endothelial dysfunction. Similarly, adaptations of the vascular smooth muscle that occur with advancing age are heterogeneous between arterioles from oxidative and glycolytic muscles. In both oxidative and glycolytic muscle, late-life exercise training reverses age-related microvascular dysfunction, and exercise training appears to be particularly effective in reversing endothelial dysfunction. Patterns of microvascular ageing that develop among muscles of diverse fibre type and function may be attributable to changing patterns of physical activity with ageing. Importantly, aerobic exercise training, initiated even at an advanced age, restores muscle blood flow distribution patterns and vascular function in old animals to those seen in their young counterparts.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether erector spinae muscle oxygenation (OXY) and blood volume during a progressive isoinertial lifting evaluation (PILE) are modified by an exercise therapy program. Design: Pre- (t1) and post- (t2) exercise therapy experimental design. Setting: Hospital. Participants: Subjects with chronic low back pain (LBP group) (n=24) and healthy subjects (control group) (n=24) were evaluated. Intervention: Exercise program. Main Outcome Measures: The control group was evaluated once, and the LBP group was evaluated before (t1) the exercise therapy program and 28 days thereafter (t2). The maximal load lifted, total work, and total power were determined using the PILE test. Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure OXY and blood volume during the PILE test. Results: The maximal load lifted, total power, and total work were significantly lower in the LBP group (-42%±5%, -46%±6%, and -67%±6% at t1, respectively; P<.05) than the control group. In the LBP subjects, these parameters improved significantly after the exercise therapy program (+20%±3%, +56%±4%, and +61%±5%; P<.05). At each submaximal power (ie, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of maximal load lifted at t1), OXY and blood volume were significantly higher at t2 than t1. One-half recovery time for OXY was significantly higher in the LBP group (at t1 and t2) than in control subjects. Conclusions: The findings in this study suggest that LBP subjects present an impairment in their capacity to deliver oxygen at the level of the erector spinae muscle, which can be partly restored by an exercise therapy program. © 2013 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

N2  - Advancing age may be the most potent independent predictor of future cardiovascular events, a relationship that is not fully explained by time-related changes in traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Since some arteries exhibit differential susceptibility to atherosclerosis, generalisations regarding the impact of ageing in humans may be overly simplistic, whereas in vivo assessment of arterial function and health provide direct insight. Coronary and peripheral (conduit, resistance and skin) arteries demonstrate a gradual, age-related impairment in vascular function that is likely to be related to a reduction in endothelium-derived nitric oxide bioavailability and/or increased production of vasoconstrictors (e.g. endothelin-1). Increased exposure and impaired ability for defence mechanisms to resist oxidative stress and inflammation, but also cellular senescence processes, may contribute to age-related changes in vascular function and health. Arteries also undergo structural changes as they age. Gradual thickening of the arterial wall, changes in wall content (i.e. less elastin, advanced glycation end-products) and increase in conduit artery diameter are observed with older age and occur similarly in central and peripheral arteries. These changes in structure have important interactive effects on artery function, with increases in small and large arterial stiffness representing a characteristic change with older age. Importantly, direct measures of arterial function and structure predict future cardiovascular events, independent of age or other cardiovascular risk factors. Taken together, and given the differential susceptibility of arteries to atherosclerosis in humans, direct measurement of arterial function and health may help to distinguish between biological and chronological age-related change in arterial health in humans.

N2  - Musculoskeletal pain due to ischemia is present in a variety of clinical conditions including peripheral vascular disease (PVD), sickle cell disease (SCD), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and even fibromyalgia (FM). The clinical features associated with deep tissue ischemia are unique because although the subjective description of pain is common to other forms of myalgia, patients with ischemic muscle pain often respond poorly to conventional analgesic therapies. Moreover, these patients also display increased cardiovascular responses to muscle contraction, which often leads to exercise intolerance or exacerbation of underlying cardiovascular conditions. This suggests that the mechanisms of myalgia development and the role of altered cardiovascular function under conditions of ischemia may be distinct compared to other injuries/diseases of the muscles. It is widely accepted that group III and IV muscle afferents play an important role in the development of pain due to ischemia. These same muscle afferents also form the sensory component of the exercise pressor reflex (EPR), which is the increase in heart rate and blood pressure (BP) experienced after muscle contraction. Studies suggest that afferent sensitization after ischemia depends on interactions between purinergic (P2X and P2Y) receptors, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) in individual populations of peripheral sensory neurons. Specific alterations in primary afferent function through these receptor mechanisms correlate with increased pain related behaviors and altered EPRs. Recent evidence suggests that factors within the muscles during ischemic conditions including upregulation of growth factors and cytokines, and microvascular changes may be linked to the overexpression of these different receptor molecules in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that in turn modulate pain and sympathetic reflexes. In this review article, we will discuss the peripheral mechanisms involved in the development of ischemic myalgia and the role that primary sensory neurons play in EPR modulation.

N2  - Objective To quantify autonomic dysfunction in fibromyalgia patients compared to healthy controls using heart rate variability (HRV). Methods Sixteen patients with fibromyalgia and 16 healthy controls were recruited in this case control study. HRV was measured using the time-domain method incorporating the following parameters: total heartbeats, the mean of intervals between consecutive heartbeats (R-R intervals), the standard deviation of normal to normal R-R intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean squared differences of successive R-R intervals (RMSSD), ratio of SDNN to RMSSD (SDNN/RMSSD), and difference between the longest and shortest R-R interval under different three conditions including normal quiet breathing, rate controlled breathing, and Valsalva maneuver. The severity of autonomic symptoms in the group of patients with fibromyalgia was measured by Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale 31 (COMPASS 31). Then we analyzed the difference between the fibromyalgia and control groups and the correlation between the COMPASS 31 and aforementioned HRV parameters in the study groups. Results Patients with fibromyalgia had significantly higher SDNN/RMSSD values under both normal quiet breathing and rate controlled breathing compared to controls. Differences between the longest and shortest R-R interval under Valsalva maneuver were also significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in controls. COMPASS 31 score was negatively correlated with SDNN/RMSSD values under rate controlled breathing. Conclusion SDNN/RMSSD is a valuable parameter for autonomic nervous system function and can be used to quantify subjective autonomic symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia.

N2  - The ability to sustain a given absolute submaximal workload declines with advancing age, likely to be due to a lower level of blood flow and O2 delivery to the exercising muscles. Given that physical inactivity mimics many of the physiological changes associated with ageing, separating the physiological consequences of ageing and physical inactivity can be challenging; yet, observations from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on the effects of physical activity have provided some insight. Physical activity has the potential to offset the age-related decline in blood flow to contracting skeletal muscle during exercise where systemic blood flow is not limited by cardiac output, thereby improving O2 delivery and allowing for an enhanced energy production from oxidative metabolism. The mechanisms underlying the increase in blood flow with regular physical activity include improved endothelial function and the ability for functional sympatholysis - an attenuation of the vasoconstrictor effect of sympathetic nervous activity. These vascular adaptations with physical activity are likely to be an effect of improved nitric oxide and ATP signalling. Collectively, precise matching of blood flow and O2 delivery to meet the O2 demand of the active skeletal muscle of aged individuals during conditions where systemic blood flow is not limited by cardiac output seems to a large extent to be related to the level of physical activity.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to correlate the heart rate variability (HRV) indices with variables of pain that were experienced by individuals with chronic neck pain. Methods: This was a blinded cross-sectional study. Individuals with chronic neck pain (n = 15) and healthy participants (n = 15), both sedentary and between 18 and 45 years of age, were included. The neck pain was assessed with the Numerical Rating Scale at rest and during cervical movements, Neck Disability Index, Catastrophic Thoughts about Pain Scale, and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia. The HRV indices (linear and nonlinear) were used for assessment of autonomic function at rest (in supine, sitting, and standing positions). Results: We observed significant correlations between the NRS, Neck Disability Index, and Catastrophic Thoughts about Pain Scale with the linear and nonlinear HRV indices (P <.05, r ≥ 0.362), so that the worst HRV indices are associated with conditions of more intense and disabling neck pain. Conclusion: The HRV indices were significantly associated with pain intensity, disabilty, and catastrophizing in individuals with chronic neck pain.

N2  - Background: Chronic pain is highly prevalent. Current management is challenged by lack of validated objective measures like biological markers. Clinical pain studies employing exercise interventions have evaluated biomarkers; however, it is unclear how exercise impacts biomarkers involved in pain pathways and whether these markers are associated with relevant pain-related outcomes. This systematic review evaluates data from clinical studies employing exercise interventions in chronic musculoskeletal nonmalignant pain conditions in which biomarkers in pain pathways were measured. Method: Published research studies from several databases were examined using the Jadad Scale for assessing the quality of clinical studies. Results: Twelve research studies were reviewed. Jadad scores ranged from 5 to 11 out of 13 points. Inflammatory markers were most commonly measured followed by neurotransmitter-related genes and metabolite-detecting genes. After exercise interventions, changes in biomarkers involved in neurotransmission and inflammation suggest a hypoalgesic exercise effect. Significant biomarker associations were found with pain intensity, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. However, there were varying methodologies in the studies reviewed. Discussion: It remains a question whether biomarkers can be used as objective measures for risk assessment, diagnosis, or evaluation or as surrogate endpoints in chronic pain. Adequate sample sizes, optimal exercise dose determination, study replications, and longitudinal research studies with consistent methodologies are warranted. Regardless, the potential translational value of biomarkers in chronic pain is evident. Advancing nursing research in biomarkers is vital for moving the nursing discipline and clinical chronic pain practice forward. Developing a biobehavioral perspective in chronic pain is also necessary for comprehensive management.

N2  - We have previously reported that there are inter-individual differences in the cardiovascular responses to experimental muscle pain, which are consistent over time: intramuscular infusion of hypertonic saline, causing pain lasting ~60 min, increases muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)-as well as blood pressure and heart rate-in certain subjects, but decrease it in others. Here, we tested the hypothesis that baseline physiological parameters (resting MSNA, heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability) determine the cardiovascular responses to long-lasting muscle pain. MSNA was recorded from the common peroneal nerve, together with heart rate and blood pressure, during a 45-min intramuscular infusion of hypertonic saline solution into the tibialis anterior of 50 awake human subjects (25 females and 25 males). Twenty-four subjects showed a sustained increase in mean amplitude of MSNA (160.9 ± 7.3%), while 26 showed a sustained decrease (55.1 ± 3.5%). Between the increasing and decreasing groups there were no differences in baseline MSNA (19.0 ± 1.5 vs. 18.9 ± 1.2 bursts/min), mean BP (88.1 ± 5.2 vs. 88.0 ± 3.8 mmHg), HR (74.7 ± 2.0 vs. 72.8 ± 1.8 beats/min) or heart rate variability (LF/HF 1.8 ± 0.2 vs. 2.2 ± 0.3). Furthermore, neither sex nor body mass index had any effect on whether MSNA increased or decreased during tonic muscle pain. We conclude that the measured baseline physiological parameters cannot account for the divergent sympathetic responses during tonic muscle pain.

N2  - Pain is a subjective sensory experience that can, mostly, be reported but cannot be directly measured or quantified. Nevertheless, a suite of biomarkers related to mechanisms, neural activity, and susceptibility offer the possibility—especially when used in combination—to produce objective pain-related indicators with the specificity and sensitivity required for diagnosis and for evaluation of risk of developing pain and of analgesic efficacy. Such composite biomarkers will also provide improved understanding of pain pathophysiology. This Perspective highlights the significance of chronic pain, its underpinning biology, and the need for composite biomarker signatures alongside self-report. Combining evidence from animal and human research spanning genetics through to neuroimaging, Tracey et al. highlight a few key areas of promise.

N2  - Background: There is paucity in the literature regarding the role of the interoceptive pathway through the insular cortex (IC), as well as heart rate variability (HRV) in relation to Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) and deep-touch. Aims: The present study investigated whether both OMT treatment and deep-touch (a newly hypothesized treatment option) was effective at altering the interoceptive pathway and HRV, whilst OMT was only expected to be effective for increasing Range of Motion (ROM). Methods: Thirty-five healthy volunteers were randomly allocated into three conditions in a repeated measures crossover design; a control (laying supine on a plinth); deep-touch (head cradling); and an osteopathic mobilization therapeutic technique on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Interoceptive accuracy (IAc), HRV, as well as range of motion (ROM) for the TMJ area as well as the cervical spine (Csp) right and left measures were taken pre and post each condition setting. Results: Significant condition effects emerged from the deep-touch and mobilization interventions for IAc where increases were identified through planned comparisons. For the HRV measure (RMSSD), a significant effect emerged in the deep-touch condition (increase) but not in the mobilization or control conditions. ROM did not increase for any condition. IAc correlated with post-ROM outcomes in many cases and HRV moderated some of these relations. Conclusion: These results are discussed in the context of clinical practice, where cranial deep-touch maybe an effective treatment and modulator of the parasympathetic nervous systems, as well as the interoceptive system.

N2  - Objectives: Heart rate variability recordings have the potential to examine the role of the autonomic nervous system. Several wearable devices are nowadays readily available. Up until now, no studies explored whether a wearable device is able to reliably measure a treatment response in chronic pain patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the reliability of a Polar V800 (Polar Electro Oy, Finland) wearable device to accurately measure RR intervals in patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) during spinal cord stimulation (SCS), as compared with an eMotion 2-lead ECG recording. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients diagnosed with FBSS and treated with SCS participated in this study. HRV was measured with a 2-lead ECG registration tool and a Polar V800 during on and off state of SCS. Intraclass correlation coefficients, correlations, limits of agreement, Cronbach's α, and effect sizes were calculated. Results: Analysis based on the recordings from the ECG and wearable device revealed the same HRV parameters (except for the time-frequency domain) to capture the treatment response of SCS. Parameters that are relevant for measuring the SCS treatment response have strong correlations (r ≥.82), good ICC values (ICC ≥0.82), acceptable consistency (α ≥.9), and limited bias. Conclusions: Similar pre- to posttreatment changes were revealed between a wearable device and 2-lead ECG with reliable HRV estimates for parameters that are able to capture the treatment changes. This suggests that a wearable heart rate monitor might be a reliable wearable tool for the detection of pre- to post treatment changes of SCS, in patients with FBSS.

N2  - The present randomised placebo controlled trial explored the extent to which osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) affects brain activity, particularly the insula, during both an “interoceptive awareness” and “exteroceptive awareness” task in a sample of 32 right-handed adults with chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) randomly assigned to either the OMT or sham group. Patients received 4 weekly sessions and fMRI was performed at enrolment (T0), immediately after the first session (T1) and at 1 month (T2). The results revealed that the OMT produced a distinct and specific reduction in BOLD response in specific brain areas related to interoception, i.e., bilateral insula, ACC, left striatum and rMFG. The observed trend across the three time points appears uncharacteristic. At T1, a marginal increase of the BOLD response was observed in all the above-mentioned areas except the rMFG, which showed a decrease in BOLD response. At T2, the response was the opposite: areas related to interoception (bilateral insula and ACC) as well as the rMFG and left striatum demonstrated significant decreased in BOLD response. The findings of this study provide an insight into the effects of manual therapies on brain activity and have implications for future research in the field.

N2  - Age is the greatest risk factor for chronic disease and is associated with a marked decline in functional capacity and quality of life. A key factor contributing to loss of function in older adults is the decline in skeletal muscle function. While the exact mechanism(s) remains incompletely understood, age-related mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to play a major role. To explore this question further, we studied 15 independently living seniors (age: 72 ± 5 years; m/f: 4/11; BMI: 27.6 ± 5.9) and 17 young volunteers (age: 25 ± 4 years; m/f: 8/9; BMI: 24.0 ± 3.3). Skeletal muscle oxidative function was measured in forearm muscle from the recovery kinetics of muscle oxygen consumption using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Muscle oxygen consumption was calculated as the slope of change in hemoglobin saturation during a series of rapid, supra-systolic arterial cuff occlusions following a brief bout of exercise. Aging was associated with a significant prolongation of the time constant of oxidative recovery following exercise (51.8 ± 5.4 sec vs. 37.1 ± 2.1 sec, P = 0.04, old vs. young, respectively). This finding suggests an overall reduction in mitochondrial function with age in nonlocomotor skeletal muscle. That these data were obtained using NIRS holds great promise in gerontology for quantitative assessment of skeletal muscle oxidative function at the bed side or clinic.

N2  - The ability to sustain submaximal exercise is largely dependent on the oxidative capacity of mitochondria within skeletal muscle, and impairments in oxidative metabolism have been implicated in many neurologic and cardiovascular pathologies. Here we review studies which have demonstrated the utility of Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a method of evaluating of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction in clinical human populations. NIRS has been previously used to noninvasively measure tissue oxygen saturation, but recent studies have demonstrated the utility of NIRS as a method of evaluating skeletal muscle oxidative capacity using post-exercise recovery kinetics of oxygen metabolism. In comparison to historical methods of measuring muscle metabolic dysfunction in vivo, NIRS provides a more versatile and economical method of evaluating mitochondrial oxidative capacity in humans. These advantages generate great potential for the clinical applicability of NIRS as a means of evaluating muscle dysfunction in clinical populations.

N2  - Mitochondrial capacity is pivotal to skeletal muscle function and is suggested to decline with age. However, there is large heterogeneity in current data, possibly due to effect modifiers such as physical activity, sex and muscle group. Yet, few studies have compared multiple muscle groups in different age groups with comparable physical activity levels. Here, we newly used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to characterise mitochondrial capacity in three different locomotor muscles in young (19–25 year) and older (65–71 year), healthy males with similar physical activity levels. Mitochondrial capacity and reperfusion after arterial occlusion was measured in the vastus lateralis (VL), the gastrocnemius (GA) and the tibialis anterior (TA). Physical activity was verified using accelerometry and was not different between the age groups (404.3 ± 214.9 vs 494.9 ± 187.0 activity kcal per day, p = 0.16). Mitochondrial capacity was significantly lower in older males in the GA and VL, but not in the TA (p = 0.048, p = 0.036 and p = 0.64, respectively). Reperfusion rate was not significantly different for the GA (p = 0.55), but was significantly faster in the TA and VL in the young group compared to the older group (p = 0.0094 and p = 0.039, respectively). In conclusion, we identified distinct modes of mitochondrial ageing in different locomotor muscles in a young and older population with similar physical activity patterns. Furthermore, we show that NIRS is suitable for relatively easy application in ageing research and can reveal novel insights into mitochondrial functioning with age.

N2  - Background: Since the introduction (in 2006) of commercially available portable wireless muscle oximeters, the use of muscle near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology is gaining in popularity as an application to observe changes in muscle metabolism and muscle oxygenation during and after exercise or training interventions in both laboratory and applied sports settings. Objectives: The objectives of this systematic review were to highlight the application of muscle oximetry in evaluating oxidative skeletal muscle performance to sport activities and emphasize how this technology has been applied to exercise and training. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in a systematic fashion to search, assess and synthesize existing literature on this topic. The Scopus and MEDLINE/PubMed electronic databases were searched to 1 March 2017. Potential inclusions were screened against eligibility criteria relating to recreationally trained to elite athletes, with or without training programs, who must have assessed physiological variables monitored by commercial oximeters or NIRS instrumentation. Results: Of the 14,609 identified records, only 57 studies met the eligibility criteria. This systematic review highlighted a number of key findings in 16 sporting activities. Overall, NIRS information can be used as a marker of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and for analyzing muscle performance factors. Conclusions: Although NIRS instrumentation is promising in evaluating oxidative skeletal muscle performance when used in sport settings, there is still the need for further instrumental development and randomized/longitudinal trials to support the detailed advantages of muscle oximetry utilization in sports science.

N2  - Aging is associated with changes in biological functions, such as reduced cardiovascular responses to stressful tasks. However, less is known about the influence of age on the reactivity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to acute stressors. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a computerized-controlled stress task on the PFC and autonomic system activity in a sample of older and younger adults. We recruited a total of 55 healthy, right-handed persons (26 older adults with mean age 69.5, SD 5.8 years; and 29 younger adults with mean age 23.8, SD 3.3 years); groups were balanced for sex. Tasks included a control and an experimental condition: during both tasks individuals had to solve simple mental arithmetic problems. For the experimental condition, all participants were faced with a time limit that induced significant stress. Physiological indexes were collected continuously during the entire procedure using a 2-channel near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and an ECG monitoring system. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to assess changes in hemoglobin concentrations, and changes in both heart rate and performance outcomes. NIRS, ECG and performance data showed a significant interaction between the group and condition. Post-hoc analyses evidenced a significant increase in heart rate and Oxy-Hb concentration in the bilateral PFC between the control and experimental condition only in the younger group. Post-hoc analyses of behavioral data showed lower percentages of correct responses and higher response times in the older group. In summary, these results suggested that cardiovascular and cortical reactivity to stress tasks are a function of age. Older individuals seem to be characterized by blunted physiological reactivity, suggestive of impaired adaptive responses to acute stressors. Therefore, future studies should investigate the underlying physiological mechanisms of prefrontal and cardiovascular changes related to aging.

N2  - Assessment of biomarkers that reflect objective indicators of physiological processes has become increasingly popular in psychological research on stress and aging. The current article reviews biomarkers of the neuroendocrine and immune systems, including issues related to measurement and normative age-related changes. We also discuss how exposure to stressors can provoke changes in these biomarkers and propose that stressful experiences may accelerate age-related declines in these systems. We recommend that future research examining physical health and aging incorporate dynamic and multivariate methods for assessing links between stressors and biomarkers. © The Author 2009.

N2  - , "Stress assessment by means of heart rate derived from functional near-infrared spectroscopy," Abstract. Many studies have been carried out in order to detect and quantify the level of mental stress by means of different physiological signals. From the physiological point of view, stress promptly affects brain and cardiac function; therefore, stress can be assessed by analyzing the brain-and heart-related signals more efficiently. Signals produced by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) of the brain together with the heart rate (HR) are employed to assess the stress induced by the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. Two different versions of the HR are used in this study. The first one is the commonly used HR derived from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and is considered as the reference HR (RHR). The other is the HR computed from the fNIRS signal (EHR) by means of an effective combinational algorithm. fNIRS and ECG signals were simultaneously recorded from 10 volunteers, and EHR and RHR are derived from them, respectively. Our results showed a high degree of agreement [r > 0.9, BAR (Bland Altman ratio) <5%] between the two HR. A principal component analysis/support vector machine-based algorithm for stress classification is developed and applied to the three measurements of fNIRS, EHR, and RHR and a classification accuracy of 78.8%, 94.6%, and 62.2% were obtained for the three measurements, respectively. From these observations, it can be concluded that the EHR carries more useful information with regards to the mental stress than the RHR and fNIRS signals. Therefore, EHR can be used alone or in combination with the fNIRS signal for a more accurate and real-time stress detection and classification.

N2  - The purpose of this investigation was to (1) describe the trends in oxygenation (OXY) and blood volume (BV) of the right and left paraspinal muscles during the Biering-Sorensen muscle endurance (BSME) test using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and (2) assess the test-retest reliability of OXY and BV changes during the BSME in healthy males. Seventeen healthy males [age=28.4 (9.8) years, height=1.75 (0.05) m, body mass=82.7 (9.1) kg; mean (SD)] completed two BSME trials within 1 week. NIRS probes were placed bilaterally at lumbar 3. The test was performed with the subject in the prone position using the following protocol: 2 min baseline, BSME, and 4 min recovery. The delta and range values of OXY and BV were used for analysis. Acceptable intra-class correlations were observed for endurance time and all the NIRS variables at the point of fatigue and at each 10% segment of the BSME during the two trials. Bland-Altman plots confirmed the reproducibility of the bilateral NIRS responses of the paravertebral muscles. The BV responses were more reliable than the OXY responses during the two trials. The OXY and BV responses of the paravertebral muscles during static contractions can be measured reliably using NIRS. Future studies should focus primarily on BV for analysis. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

N2  - Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are involved in regulating pain states. The activity of these systems seems to become disturbed in states of chronic pain. This disruption in autonomic balance can be measured through the assessment of heart rate variability (HRV), that is, the variability of the interval between consecutive heart beats. However, there is yet to be a systematic evaluation of the body of literature concerning HRV across several chronic pain conditions. Moreover, modern meta-analytical techniques have never been used to validate and consolidate the extent to which HRV may be decreased in chronic pain. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines, this study systematically evaluated and critically appraised the literature concerning HRV in people living with chronic pain. After screening 17,350 sources, 51 studies evaluating HRV in a chronic pain group met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-six moderate-high quality studies were included in quantitative meta-analyses. On average, the quality of studies was moderate. There were 6 frequency-domain and time-domain measures of HRV across a broad range of chronic pain conditions. High heterogeneity aside, pooled results from the meta-analyses reflected a consistent, moderate-to-large effect of decreased high-frequency HRV in chronic pain, implicating a decrease in parasympathetic activation. These effects were heavily influenced by fibromyalgia studies. Future research would benefit from wider use of standardised definitions of measurement, and also investigating the synergistic changes in pain state and HRV throughout the development and implementation of mechanism-based treatments for chronic pain.

N2  - Various pain conditions may result in altered autonomic nervous system regulation. We evaluated whether autonomic regulation, analyzed with short-term heart rate variability (HRV), differs between low back pain (LBP) patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we tested if short-term HRV recordings are feasible and informative in planning home monitoring of LBP patients. The study population consisted of 16 volunteers (8 LBP patients and 8 healthy subjects) (age 42±10 years, body mass index 26±4 kg/m2, 7 men and 9 women). Usually 3- to 5-minute R-R interval recordings have been used as short-term recordings of HRV, but recent evidence supports even shorter R-R interval recording procedure for short-term HRV assessment. We collected R-R interval data for 1 minute in sitting, standing and bending down tasks. Mean heart rate (HR) and vagally mediated beat-to-beat variability (SD1 and rMSSD) were analyzed. The results showed that autonomic nervous system function assessed with the short-term measurement HRV method differentiates LBP patients from healthy controls in sitting and standing. Vagally mediated SD1 and rMSSD were significantly lower and the HR was higher among the patients compared to the controls. A novel finding was also the feasibility of 1-minute measurement of HRV, which may open entirely new opportunities to assess accurately concomitant changes in autonomic nervous system function and self-reported individual pain experience. This could lead to a more personalized pain treatment and more efficient health care resource allocation as the new measurement methods is more suitable for home monitoring than the previously used ones.

N2  - Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by reduced heart rate variability (HRV) of unknown cause. We tested the hypothesis that low HRV, indicative of cardiac autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction, was associated with systemic inflammation and pain. Given the high prevalence of hypertension (HTN) in RA, a condition itself associated with low HRV, we also assessed whether the presence of hypertension further reduced HRV in RA. Methods In RA-normotensive (n = 13), RA-HTN (n = 17), normotensive controls (NC; n = 17) and HTN (n = 16) controls, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. Time and frequency domain measures of HRV along with serological markers of inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], tumour necrosis factor-α [TNF-α] and interleukins [IL]) were determined. Reported pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Results Time (rMSSD, pNN50%) and frequency (high frequency power, low frequency power, total power) domain measures of HRV were lower in the RA, RA-HTN and HTN groups, compared to NC (p = 0.001). However, no significant differences in HRV were noted between the RA, RA-HTN and HTN groups. Inverse associations were found between time and frequency measures of HRV and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10), but were not independent after multivariable analysis. hs-CRP and pain were independently and inversely associated with time domain (rMMSD, pNN50%) parameters of HRV. Conclusions These findings suggest that lower HRV is associated with increased inflammation and independently associated with increased reported pain, but not compounded by the presence of HTN in patients with RA.

N2  - Objective: To assess the association of cardiovascular autonomic balance with perceived functional impairment and pain among patients with chronic lowi back pain. Design: A cross-sectional analysis of working patients with chronic low back pain. Patients: Forty-six consecutive patients aged 24-45 years with chronic low back pain fulfilling the inclusion criteria. A total of 39 subjects had technically acceptable electrocardiographic recordings during periods of rest and standard provocations. Methods: Perceived functional disability was assessed with the Oswestry disability index and pain with a numerical rating scale. Autonomic nervous function was assessed by measuring heart rate variability with short recordings. Results: The total power of heart rate variability was lower among those with moderate perceived disability (Oswestry 20-40%) compared with those with minimal disability (Oswestry <20%). However, heart rate variability did not differ significantly among those with numerical rating scale values ≤5/10 from those with values >5/10. The power of the high-frequency component (0.15-0.4 Hz) of heart rate variability was lower among those with moderate perceived functional impairment. Conclusion: A significant association existed between heart rate variability and perceived physical impairment, but not between heart rate variability and pain. Proportionally reduced high-frequency activity was found to reflect decreased parasympathetic activity or increased: sympathetic activity. This resulted in sympathetic dominance among the patients with higher subjective disability. The possible clinical implications of this observation are discussed. © 2008 The Authors Journal Compilation © 2008 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information.

N2  - There are extensive interactions between the neural structures involved in pain sensation and autonomic control. The insular and anterior cingulate cortices, amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey, parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, ventrolateral medulla and raphe nuclei receive converging nociceptive and visceral inputs from the spinal and trigeminal dorsal horns and initiate arousal, affective, autonomic, motor and pain modulatory responses to painful stimuli. This review will focus on some central pain-autonomic interactions potentially relevant for the pathophysiology of primary headache. © Springer-VerlagItalia 2006.

N2  - Release of substance P (SP) from nociceptive nerve fibers and activation of its receptor neurokinin 1 (NK1) are important effectors in the transmission of pain signals. Nonetheless, the role of SP in muscle pain remains unknown. Here we show that a single i.m. acid injection in mice lacking SP signaling by deletion of the tachykinin precursor 1 (Tac1) gene or coadministration of NK1 receptor antagonists produces long-lasting hyperalgesia rather than the transient hyperalgesia seen in control animals. The inhibitory effect of SP was found exclusively in neurons expressing acid-sensing ion channel 3, where SP enhances M-channel-like potassium currents through the NK1 receptor in a G protein-independent but tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, the SP signaling could alter action potential thresholds and modulate the expression of TTX-resistant sodium currents in medium-sized muscle nociceptors. Thus, i.m. SP mediates an unconventional NK1 receptor signal pathway to inhibit acid activation in muscle nociceptors, resulting in an unexpected antinociceptive effect against chronic mechanical hyperalgesia, here induced by repeated i.m. acid injection.

N2  - The perception of pain is sensitive to various mental processes such as the feelings and beliefs that someone has about pain. It is therefore not exclusively driven by the noxious input. Attentional modulation involving the descending pain modulatory system has been examined extensively in neuroimaging studies. However, the investigation of neural mechanisms underlying more complex cognitive modulation is an emerging field in pain research. Recent findings indicate an engagement of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during more complex modulation, leading to a change or reappraisal of the emotional significance of pain. Taking placebo-induced analgesia as an example, we discuss the contribution of attention, expectation and reappraisal as three basic mechanisms that are important for the cognitive modulation of pain. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Muscle pain is common, but the understanding of its causes is still patchy. This article addresses the mechanisms of some important types of muscle pain. Methods: Selective literature review, predominantly of data derived from neuroanatomical and electrophysiological experiments on anesthetized rats. Results: Muscle pain is evoked by specialised nerve endings (nociceptors). Important stimuli for muscle pain are adenosintriphosphate (ATP) and a low tissue pH. Excitation of muscle nociceptors leads to hyperexcitability of spinal sensory neurones (central sensitization). Low frequency activity in muscle nociceptors is sufficient to induce central sensitization. Discussion: Central sensitization leads to increased excitation in the spinal cord and to referral of muscle pain. The motoneurones of a painful muscle are centrally inhibited. Muscular spasm is mostly secondary to a painful lesion in another muscle or joint. The pain of fibromyalgia is assumed to relate to a dysfunction of central nociceptive processing. Psychosocial factors also contribute to pain.

N2  - Between-person variability in pain sensitivity remains poorly understood. Given a conceptualization of pain as a homeostatic emotion, we hypothesized inverse associations between measures of resting heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic regulation of heart rate that has been linked to emotionality, and sensitivity to subsequently administered thermal pain. Resting electrocardiography was collected, and frequency-domain measures of HRV were derived through spectral analysis. Fifty-nine right-handed participants provided ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness following exposure to 4 °C thermal pain stimulation, and indicated their thresholds for barely noticeable and moderate pain during three exposures to decreasing temperature. Greater low-frequency HRV was associated with lower ratings of 4 °C pain unpleasantness and higher thresholds for barely noticeable and moderate pain. High-frequency HRV was unrelated to measures of pain sensitivity. Findings suggest pain sensitivity is influenced by characteristics of a central homeostatic system also involved in emotion. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Conditions with chronic widespread non-inflammatory muscle pain, such as fibromyalgia, have complex etiologies with numerous proposed mechanisms for their pathophysiology of underlying chronic pain. Advancements in neuroimaging have allowed for the study of brain function and connectivity in humans with these conditions, while development of animal models have allowed for the study of both peripheral and central factors that lead to chronic pain. This article reviews the current literature surrounding the pathophysiology of chronic widespread non-inflammatory muscle pain focusing on both peripheral and central nervous system, as well as immune system, contributions to the development and maintenance of pain. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these conditions can allow for improvements in patient education, treatment and outcomes.

N2  - Background: Recent studies indicate that diminished blood flow may cause low back symptoms and intervertebral disc degeneration. Purpose: To explore the association between lumbARterial stenosis as detected by two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (2D TOF-MRA) and lumbar pain symptoms in an occupational cohort of middle-aged Finnish males. Material and Methods: 228 male subjects aged 36 to 55 years (mean 47 years) were imaged with 2D TOF-MRA. Additionally, 20 randomly selected subjects were scanned with contrast-enhanced MRA (ceMRA). In each subject, the first (L1) to fourth (L4) segmental lumbARteries were evaluated for lumbARtery stenosis using a dichotomic scale. One subject was excluded because of poor image quality, reducing the study population to 227 subjects. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between arterial stenosis in 2D TOF-MRA and low back pain and sciatica symptoms (intensity, duration, frequency). Results: Comparing 2D TOF-MRA and ceMRA images, the kappa value (95% confidence interval) was 0.52 (0.31-0.73). The intraobserver reliability kappa value for 2D TOF-MRA was 0.85 (0.77-0.92), and interobserver kappa was 0.57 (0.49-0.65). The sensitivity of 2D TOF-MRA in detecting stenosis was 0.58, the accuracy 0.89, and the specificity 0.94. In 97 (43%) subjects all arteries were normal, whereas 130 (57%) had at least one stenosed artery. The left L4 artery was most often affected. The degree of arterial stenosis was associated with intensity of low back and sciatic pain, and sciatica pain duration during the past 3 months. Conclusion: 2D TOF-MRA is an acceptable imaging method for arterial stenosis compared to ceMRA. Arterial stenosis was associated with subjective pain symptoms, indicating a role of decreased nutrition in spinal disorders. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Background: While metabolic health is acknowledged to affect connective tissue structure and function, the mechanisms are unclear. Glucocorticoids are present in almost every cell type throughout the body and control key physiological processes such as energy homeostasis, stress response, inflammatory and immune processes, and cardiovascular function. Glucocorticoid excess manifests as visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. As these metabolic states are also associated with tendinopathy and tendon rupture, it may be that glucocorticoids excess is the link between metabolic health and tendinopathy.Objective: To synthesise current knowledge linking glucocorticoids exposure to tendon structure and function.Methods: Narrative literature review.Results: We provide an overview of endogenous glucocorticoid production, regulation, and signalling. Next we review the impact that oral glucocorticoid has on risk of tendon rupture and the effect that injected glucocorticoid has on resolution of symptoms. Then we highlight the clinical and mechanistic overlap between tendinopathy and glucocorticoid excess in the areas of visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In these areas, we highlight the role of glucocorticoids and how these hormones might underpin the connection between metabolic health and tendon dysfunction.Conclusions: There are several plausible pathways through which glucocorticoids might mediate the connection between metabolic health and tendinopathy.

N2  - Objective: The goal of this systematic literature review is to determine whether there are differences and similarities in heart rate variability (HRV) between adult patients with fibromyalgia (FM), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and healthy pain-free control subjects. Methods: To obtain relevant articles, PubMed and Web of Knowledge were searched for case-control studies. Selection of the literature was based on selection criteria ascertaining studies with adult human patient groups comparing HRV. Risk of bias and levels of evidence were determined. Results: Sixteen case-control studies were included, 10 comparing FM patients to controls and 6 comparing CFS patients to controls. Methodological quality was moderate to good. Both time domain and frequency domain measurements were used. The majority of the researchers observed lower HRV in FM patients compared to healthy control persons, as well as increased sympathetic activity and a blunted autonomic response to stressors. Resistance training improved HRV in FM patients. In CFS patients HRV was only reduced during sleep. Conclusion: FM patients show more HRV aberrances and indices of increased sympathetic activity. Increased sympathetic activity is only present in CFS patients at night. Since direct comparisons are lacking and some confounders have to be taken into account, further research is warranted. The role of pain and causality can be subject of further research, as well as therapy studies directed to reduced HRV. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity is viewed as a major component of the emotion response in many recent theories of emotion. Positions on the degree of specificity of ANS activation in emotion, however, greatly diverge, ranging from undifferentiated arousal, over acknowledgment of strong response idiosyncrasies, to highly specific predictions of autonomic response patterns for certain emotions. A review of 134 publications that report experimental investigations of emotional effects on peripheral physiological responding in healthy individuals suggests considerable ANS response specificity in emotion when considering subtypes of distinct emotions. The importance of sound terminology of investigated affective states as well as of choice of physiological measures in assessing ANS reactivity is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Autonomic arousal frequently is assumed to be a component of the pain response, perhaps because physiological mechanisms connecting pain and autonomic reactivity can be easily conceptualized. The evidence clarifying autonomic responses specific to painful stimulation, however, has been rather sporadic and lacks coherence; thus, a summary and critical review is needed in this area.
OBJECTIVES: To summarize and integrate findings from 39 experimental investigations from 1970 to 2012 of pain-induced autonomic arousal in humans.
METHODS: Medline and PsycINFO databases were searched for relevant articles. References from these articles were also considered for review.
RESULTS: Painful stimuli increase respiration rate, induce muscle tension, intensify electrodermal activity and dilate the pupils. Cardiovascular activity also increases, but the pattern displayed in response to pain is complex; peripheral vasoconstriction and sympathetically mediated cardiac responses are most typical. Additionally, autonomic expression of pain shows inconsistent relations with verbal and overt motor responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic arousal can be legitimately measured and modified as one facet of the pain response. Future research should particularly focus on increasing sample size and broadening the diversity of participants. To improve the ability to compare and contrast findings across studies, as well as to increase the applicability of laboratory findings to naturalistic pain, investigators also must enhance experimental design by increasing uniformity or accounting for differences in methodology. Finally, further work remains to utilize more specific assessments of autonomic response and to assess relationships of autonomic reactivity with other cognitive (e.g., attention) and affective (e.g., anxiety) variables.

N2  - In the original article, there was an error. It was erroneously stated that the hemodynamic activity during compression at a non-MTrP decreased instead of increased and increased instead of decreased during compression at an MTrP. A correction has been made to Results, Hemodynamic Responses, paragraph one: “Compression significantly affected cerebral hemodynamic activity. Figure 4 shows typical examples of hemodynamic responses during compression for 30 s at MTrPs and non-MTrPs, shown as effect sizes of Oxy-Hb concentration. The topographical maps of effect sizes indicated that hemodynamic activity increased in the pPFC during compression at a non-MTrP (left panel in A), while hemodynamic activity decreased in the pPFC during compression at an MTrP (left panel in B). Temporal patterns ofOxy-Hb signals showed similar changes; oxy-Hb signals gradually increased in the pPFC during compression at non-MTrPs (right panel in A), while Oxy-Hb concentration gradually decreased in the pPFC during MTrP compression (right panel in B).” The authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way.

N2  - Background Reactivity of the autonomic nervous system to experimental pain stimuli has been extensively studied using measures of heart rate and blood pressure. Heart rate variability (HRV) attempts to tease out the relative contributions of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in the autonomic control of the heart and may therefore be more appropriate to investigate autonomic response to short-term nociceptive stimulation in detail. The current evidence on HRV and experimentally induced pain has not yet been synthesized within a systematic review. Method English articles indexed in PubMed, EMBASE, Psyndex, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were reviewed for eligibility under pre-specified inclusion criteria. Studies were included when they reported empirical work on autonomic response (specifically, HRV) to experimentally induced pain in healthy adults. The method of pain induction, the methodological features of HRV analysis (time domain and frequency domain measures), as well as pain and HRV-related findings were derived from the studies. Results The search revealed a total of 20 publications eligible for inclusion. Key results demonstrate an increase in sympathetic-baroreflex activity and a decrease in vagal-parasympathetic activity as reflected by changes in frequency domain measures of HRV. Conclusion HRV has several advantages compared to other measures of autonomic reactivity in studies investigating physiological response to nociceptive stimulation. Future studies should focus on comparisons between different methods of pain induction, interindividual variability in pain sensitivity by baseline autonomic activity, and the implications of both on the use of HRV within routine clinical evaluations. © 2013 European Pain Federation - EFIC®.

N2  - Introduction: Long-lasting experimental muscle pain elicits divergent muscle sympathetic responses, with some individuals exhibiting a persistent increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), and others a decrease. These divergent responses are thought to result from sustained functional changes in specific brain regions that modulate the cardiovascular responses to pain. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate brain regions that are functionally coupled to the generation of an MSNA burst at rest and to determine their behavior during tonic muscle pain. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed concurrently with microelectrode recording of MSNA from the common peroneal nerve during a 40 min infusion of hypertonic saline into the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle of 37 healthy human subjects. Results: At rest, blood oxygen level-dependent signal intensity coupled to bursts of MSNA increased in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus and decreased in the region of the midbrain periaqueductal gray. During pain, MSNA-coupled signal intensity was greater in the region of the nucleus tractus solitarius, midbrain periaqueductal gray, dorsolateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices, than at rest. Conversely, MSNA-coupled signal intensity decreased during pain in parts of the prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: These results suggest that multiple brain regions are recruited in a burst-to-burst manner, and the magnitude of these signal changes is correlated to the overall change in MSNA amplitude during tonic muscle pain.

N2  - Background: Compression of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles is reported to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain. Methods: The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment. Results: The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P < 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P < 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P < 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P < 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P < 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P < 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P < 0.05). Discussion: The results suggest that MTrP compression at the lumbar muscle modulates pPFC activity and functional connectivity between the pPFC and insula, which may relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain.

N2  - Background: Tendinopathy is a clinical diagnosis of localised tendon pain often confirmed by imaging findings. The pathophysiological cause of the pain is unknown and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) may be implicated. Objective: To review what is known regarding the role of the SNS in human tendinopathy. Study selection: Published data describing sympathetic innervation or an index of sympathetic activity in human tendons were eligible for inclusion. Data sources : Bibliographical databases (AMED, Biological Abstracts, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science) were searched for relevant articles. Reference lists from included articles were screened for additional articles. Study appraisal: Studies were scored with a quality assessment tool to identify potential sources of bias. Each question had an explicit decision rule to guide assessment. Results: Nine case–control and four cross-sectional studies examined sympathetic innervation of tendons. There was evidence suggesting a lack of difference in sympathetic innervation of tendon proper between tendinopathy biopsies and healthy controls. In contrast, the paratendinous tissue showed evidence of increased sympathetic innervation in painful tendons. The most notable increase in SNS markers was seen in abnormal tenocytes from painful tendons. Data from two studies were suitable for meta-analysis. These heterogeneous studies revealed no difference in sympathetic innervation between painful and pain-free tendons. No studies recorded SNS activity in vivo. Conclusion: Sympathetic innervation in painful tendons depends on tissue type. Abnormal tenocytes may have increased capacity for self-production of sympathetic neurotransmitters. Future insight may be gained by measuring global in vivo sympathetic drive in tendinopathy.

N2  - Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability has often been used to assess cardiac autonomic function; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power of heart rate variability to cardiac sympathetic tone has been unclear. With or without adjustment for high-frequency (HF) power, total power or respiration, LF power seems to provide an index not of cardiac sympathetic tone but of baroreflex function. Manipulations and drugs that change LF power or LF:HF may do so not by affecting cardiac autonomic outflows directly but by affecting modulation of those outflows by baroreflexes. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Although analysis of heart rate variability is widely used for the assessment of autonomic function, its fundamental framework linking low-frequency and high-frequency components of heart rate variability with sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic divisions has developed in the 1980s. This simplified framework is no longer able to deal with much evidence about heart rate variability accumulated over the past half-century. This review addresses the pitfalls caused by the old framework and discusses the points that need attention in autonomic assessment by heart rate variability.

N2  - Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is a part of the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily regulates internal body functions. It appears to modulate the processing of nociceptive information. Many orofacial pain conditions involve inflammation of orofacial tissues and/or injury of nerve, some of which might be attributed to SNS. Thus, the aim of this review was to bring together the data available regarding the peripheral sympathetic mechanisms involved in orofacial pain. A clearer understanding of SNS–sensory interactions in orofacial pain may provide a basis for novel therapeutic strategies for conditions that respond poorly to conventional treatments.

N2  - We recently showed that long-lasting muscle pain, induced by intramuscular infusion of hypertonic saline, evoked two patterns of cardiovascular responses across subjects: one group showed parallel increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), blood pressure, and heart rate, while the other group showed parallel decreases. Given that MSNA is consistent day to day, we tested the hypothesis that individuals who show increases in MSNA during experimental muscle pain will show consistent responses over time. MSNA was recorded from the peroneal nerve, together with blood pressure and heart rate, during an intramuscular infusion of hypertonic saline causing pain for an hour in 15 subjects on two occasions, 2-27 weeks apart. Pain intensity ratings were not significantly different between the first (5.8 ± 0.4/10) and second (6.1 ± 0.2) recording sessions. While four subjects showed significant decreases in the first session (46.6 ± 9.2 % of baseline) and significant increases in the second (159.6 ± 8.9 %), in 11 subjects, there was consistency in the changes in MSNA over time: either a sustained decrease (55.6 ± 6.8 %, n = 6) or a sustained increase (143.5 ± 6.1 %, n = 5) occurred in both recording sessions. There were no differences in pain ratings between sessions for any subjects. We conclude that the changes in MSNA during long-lasting muscle pain are consistent over time in the majority of individuals, reflecting the importance of studying interindividual differences in physiology. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Carotid baroreceptor stimulation has been shown to dampen pain. This study tested, in 40 normotensive adults, the hypothesis that pain is lower during systole when arterial baroreceptor stimulation is maximal than diastole when stimulation is minimal. The sural nerve was stimulated electrocutaneously to obtain a nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) threshold, and then stimulation was delivered for 28 trials at 100% NFR threshold at seven intervals after the R-wave. Nociceptive responding was indexed by electromyographic (EMG) activity elicited in the biceps femoris. Significant variations in EMG activity occurred across the cardiac cycle, with less activity midcycle, indicating that the NFR response was attenuated during systole compared to diastole. Stimulation of baroreceptors by natural changes in blood pressure during the cardiac cycle dampened nociception, and accordingly, the data support the arterial baroreflex mechanism of hypertensive hypoalgesia.

N2  - In the present study, the relationship between cardiac baroreceptor function and the perception of acute pain was investigated in 60 normotensive subjects. Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was determined using the sequence method based on continuous blood pressure recordings. A cold pressor test was used for pain induction. Visual analogue scales and a questionnaire were applied in order to quantify sensory and affective pain experience. Moderated multiple regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between baroreceptor reflex sensitivity assessed during painful stimulation and the intensity of experienced pain. This relationship was moderated by resting blood pressure, with decreasing blood pressure being accompanied by a decrease in the magnitude of the association. Furthermore, resting blood pressure was inversely related to pain intensity. The inverse association between baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and pain experience is discussed as reflecting the well-established pain-inhibiting effect of baroreceptor activity. The finding that this relationship was less pronounced in the case of lower blood pressure suggests that baroreceptor-mediated pain attenuation is reduced in this population. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model and update it with recent results. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis of recent neuroimaging studies on the relationship between heart rate variability and regional cerebral blood flow. We identified a number of regions, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in which significant associations across studies were found. We further propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. Heart rate variability may provide an index of how strongly 'top-down' appraisals, mediated by cortical-subcortical pathways, shape brainstem activity and autonomic responses in the body. If the default response to uncertainty is the threat response, as we propose here, contextual information represented in 'appraisal' systems may be necessary to overcome this bias during daily life. Thus, HRV may serve as a proxy for 'vertical integration' of the brain mechanisms that guide flexible control over behavior with peripheral physiology, and as such provides an important window into understanding stress and health. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Previous research has suggested that heart rate variability (HRV; the variability in the interval between successive heartbeats) can predict the perception of experimentally-induced pain (i.e., pain sensitivity). However, little research has sought to investigate sex-specific associations between HRV and pain sensitivity. This is an important consideration, given that sex differences in resting HRV have been observed, and there has been extensive debate about sex differences in sensitivity to experimentally-induced pain. We examined whether the association between resting HRV and sensitivity to experimentally-induced pain differed in men and women. Fifty-one pain free individuals (26 women, mean age = 21.9 years) participated. Resting electrocardiography (ECG) was collected during a paced breathing task (15 cycles per minute), and measures of HRV were extracted via Fast Fourier Transformation. Thermal heat pain threshold (i.e., the point at which the sensation was first perceived as painful, rather than warm) was measured with a Medoc Pathway Pain and Sensory Evaluation System. There were no sex differences in resting HRV or thermal heat pain threshold, nor did sex moderate the relationship between HRV and thermal heat pain threshold. However, there were significant positive relationships between thermal heat pain threshold and LF-HRV (r = 0.47), and HF-HRV (r = 0.43) in men, but not in women. The results suggest that higher pain threshold appears to be related to greater engagement of the inhibitory parasympathetic nervous system in men only, and that other biopsychosocial mechanisms may contribute to experimental pain experience in women. Future research is needed to study these mechanisms further, accounting for other factors known to influence nociceptive and cardiovascular regulatory processes (e.g., ethnicity, hormones).

N2  - In the present paper we present the outlines of a model that integrates autonomic, attentional, and affective systems into a functional and structural network that may help to guide us in our understanding of emotion regulation and dysregulation. We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - The neurovisceral integration (NVI) model was originally proposed to account for observed relationships between peripheral physiology, cognitive performance, and emotional/physical health. This model has also garnered a considerable amount of empirical support, largely from studies examining cardiac vagal control. However, recent advances in functional neuroanatomy, and in computational neuroscience, have yet to be incorporated into the NVI model. Here we present an updated/expanded version of the NVI model that incorporates these advances. Based on a review of studies of structural/functional anatomy, we first describe an eight-level hierarchy of nervous system structures, and the contribution that each level plausibly makes to vagal control. Second, we review recent work on a class of computational models of brain function known as “predictive coding” models. We illustrate how the computational dynamics of these models, when implemented within our proposed vagal control hierarchy, can increase understanding of the relationship between vagal control and both cognitive performance and emotional/physical health. We conclude by discussing novel implications of this updated NVI model for future research.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The understanding of the risk factors for CVD may yield important insights into the prevention, etiology, course, and treatment of this major public health concern. Autonomic imbalance, characterized by a hyperactive sympathetic system and a hypoactive parasympathetic system, is associated with various pathological conditions. Over time, excessive energy demands on the system can lead to premature aging and diseases. Therefore, autonomic imbalance may be a final common pathway to increased morbidity and mortality from a host of conditions and diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) may be used to assess autonomic imbalances, diseases and mortality. Parasympathetic activity and HRV have been associated with a wide range of conditions including CVD. Here we review the evidence linking HRV to established and emerging modifiable and non-modifiable CVD risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, family history and work stress. Substantial evidence exists to support the notion that decreased HRV precedes the development of a number of risk factors and that lowering risk profiles is associated with increased HRV. We close with a suggestion that a model of autonomic imbalance may provide a unifying framework within which to investigate the impact of risk factors, including psychosocial factors and work stress, on cardiovascular disease. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Aim: Do distraction from- or attention to sural nerve stimulation affect pain, heart rate variability, and a spinal withdrawal reflex? Material and methods: In 26 male volunteers, electrical stimulation at the distal cutaneous receptive field of the sural nerve elicited pain and a nociceptive withdrawal reflex. Intensity of pain was rated on a numeric rating scale. Electromyographic reflex responses were measured from biceps femoris muscle. Cardiac autonomic function was estimated by heart rate variability measures and was expressed in the time domain as mean of RR-intervals for normal heart beats (mean-RR) and standard deviation of all normal RR-intervals (SD-NN) and, in the frequency domain, where pure vagal activity was assessed by high frequency power (0.15-0.4 Hz). Low frequency power (0.04-0.15 Hz) reflects both parasympathetic and sympathetic control. Effect parameters were recorded before and during random distraction and attention. Distraction from sural nerve stimulation was induced by a mental arithmetic test, paced auditory serial addition task (PASAT), while attention was induced by concentrating on painful foot stimulation. Results: Paced auditory serial addition task decreased mean-RR and SD-NN, frequency domain parameters, as well as pain (P < 0.001). In contrast, PASAT did not change the spinal withdrawal reflex. Attention did not affect any effect parameter. Conclusion: Distraction by PASAT altered autonomic activity and inhibited pain but failed to affect withdrawal reflex responses, while attention had no effect on either parameter. Psychological distraction and attention may have different effects on noxious evoked pain perception and autonomic activity. Pain relief during PASAT probably involves supraspinal mechanisms.

N2  - The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and pain interact on many levels of the neuraxis. In healthy subjects, activation of the SNS in the brain usually suppresses pain mainly by descending inhibition of nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord. Furthermore, some experimental data even suggest that the SNS might control peripheral inflammation and nociceptive activation. However, even subtle changes in pathophysiology can dramatically change the effect of SNS on pain, and vice versa. In the periphery, inflammation or nociceptive activation is enhanced, spinal descending inhibition is reversed to spinal facilitation, and finally the awareness of all these changes will induce anxiety, which furthermore amplifies pain perception, affects pain behavior, and depresses mood. Unraveling the detailed molecular mechanisms of how this interaction of SNS and pain is established in health and disease will help us to treat pain more successfully in the future. © 2007 Humana Press Inc.

N2  - Purpose: The central autonomic network (CAN) is an intricate system of brainstem, subcortical, and cortical structures that play key roles in the function of the autonomic nervous system. Prior to the advent of functional neuroimaging, in vivo studies of the human CAN were limited. The purpose of this review is to highlight the contribution of functional neuroimaging, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to the study of the CAN, and to discuss recent advances in this area. Additionally, we aim to emphasize exciting areas for future research. Methods: We reviewed the existing literature in functional neuroimaging of the CAN. Here, we focus on fMRI research conducted in healthy human subjects, as well as research that has been done in disease states, to understand CAN function. To minimize confounding, papers examining CAN function in the context of cognition, emotion, pain, and affective disorders were excluded. Results: fMRI has led to significant advances in the understanding of human CAN function. The CAN is composed of widespread brainstem and forebrain structures that are intricately connected and play key roles in reflexive and modulatory control of autonomic function. Conclusions: fMRI technology has contributed extensively to current knowledge of CAN function. It holds promise to serve as a biomarker in disease states. With ongoing advancements in fMRI technology, there is great opportunity and need for future research involving the CAN.

N2  - Objective: This study involves a comprehensive investigation of autonomic cardiovascular regulation in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) at rest and during painful stimulation and its association with pain indices. Methods: In 35 patients and 29 healthy controls, electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, and finger continuous blood pressure measurements were conducted. For the purpose of experimental pain induction, a cold pressor test was applied. Results: FMS patients showed lower pain threshold and tolerance, as well as higher ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness on visual analogue scales. Resting stroke volume, myocardial contractility, R-R interval, heart rate variability, and sensitivity of the cardiac baroreflex were reduced in the patients, and increases in stroke volume and myocardial contractility during cold pressor stimulation were less pronounced. In the whole sample as well as in the FMS group, baroreflex sensitivity was inversely associated with subjective pain intensity, and a higher number of baroreflex operations per unit of time predicted higher pain tolerance. Conclusions: The data suggest impaired autonomic cardiovascular regulation in FMS in terms of reduced sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, as well as blunted sympathetic reactivity to acute stress. The association between baroreflex function and pain experience reflects the pain inhibition mediated by the baroreceptor system. Given the reduced baroreflex sensitivity in FMS, one may assume deficient ascending pain inhibition arising from the cardiovascular system, which may contribute to the exaggerated pain sensitivity of FMS. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) measurements provide means for the objective assessment of cardiovascular autonomic function. As previous studies have associated chronic pain with abnormal autonomic function, we aimed to characterize the relationship between the number of musculoskeletal pain sites (NPS), pain intensity, and cardiovascular autonomic function among the population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Methods: At the age of 46, cohort members self-reported their musculoskeletal pains (enabling the determination of NPS [0-8] and pain intensity [Numerical Rating Scale, NRS, 0-10]) and underwent clinical assessments of cardiovascular autonomic function in seated and standing positions (HRV variables: heart rate [HR] and root mean square of successive differences in beat-to-beat intervals [rMSSD] for the entire cohort; BRS variables: low-frequency systolic blood pressure variability [SBPV] and cross-spectral baroreflex sensitivity [BRS] for those attending the examination in Oulu, Finland). Extensive confounder data were also collected (body mass index, physical activity, smoking, Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, comorbidities, and medications). The full samples included 4186 and 2031 individuals (HRV and BRS samples, respectively). Three subanalyses focused on individuals with intense and frequent pain, individuals with symptoms of depression and anxiety, and the relationship between pain intensity and autonomic parameters. Results: Linear regression models showed varying associations between NPS, pain intensity, and cardiovascular autonomic parameters. However, after all adjustments NPS was only associated with one outcome among women (BRS, standing: beta = - 0.015, p = 0.048) and two among men (HR, seated: beta = - 0.902, p = 0.003; HR, standing: beta = - 0.843, p = 0.014). Pain intensity was not associated with any outcome after full adjustments. Significant sex∗pain interactions were found in the data. Conclusions: Our data suggest that musculoskeletal pain has, at most, a limited independent association with cardiovascular autonomic function. Future studies should carefully account for the potential confounders and sex interactions that this study revealed.

N2  - We examined the impact of baroreceptor stimulation on pain and cardiovascular responses in 39 healthy participants. Carotid baroreceptors were stimulated with external suction (-50. mmHg, stimulation) or pressure (+8. mmHg, control). Pain was induced by pressure to the nail of the left-index finger and quantified by a visual analog scale. Pain decreased heart rate (HR) and increased blood pressure (BP). Baroreceptor stimulation further decreased HR and reduced the BP increase. Pain experience failed to differ between baroreceptor stimulation conditions. However, significant results were obtained when trials were categorized according to the magnitude of the HR deceleration elicited by baroreceptor stimulation. In trials with strong baroreceptor-elicited HR deceleration pain intensity was lower than in trials both with inactive baroreceptor stimulation (pressure trials) or trials with small baroreceptor-elicited HR responses. Anti-nociceptive effects of baroreceptor stimulation depend on the activation of the reflex cardiovascular response. Central nervous inhibition due to baroreceptor stimulation only occurs if the peripheral cardiovascular response is engaged. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The neural regulation of circulatory function is mainly effected through the interplay of the sympathetic and vagal outflows. This interaction can be explored by assessing cardiovascular rhythmicity with appropriate spectral methodologies. Spectral analysis of cardiovascular signal variability, and in particular of RR period (heart rate variability, HRV), is a widely used procedure to investigate autonomic cardiovascular control and/or target function impairment. The oscillatory pattern which characterizes the spectral profile of heart rate and arterial pressure short-term variability consists of two major components, at low (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (HF, synchronous with respiratory rate) frequency, respectively, related to vasomotor and respiratory activity. With this procedure the state of sympathovagal balance modulating sinus node pacemaker activity can be quantified in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Changes in sympathovagal balance can be often detected in basal conditions, however a reduced responsiveness to an excitatory stimulus is the most common feature that characterizes numerous pathophysiological states. Moreover the attenuation of an oscillatory pattern or its impaired responsiveness to a given stimulus can also reflect an altered target function and thus can furnish interesting prognostic markers. The dynamic assessment of these autonomic changes may provide crucial diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic information, not only in relation to cardiovascular, but also non-cardiovascular disease. As linear methodologies fail to provide significant information in conditions of extremely reduced variability (e.g. strenuous exercise, heart failure) and in presence of rapid and transients changes or coactivation of the two branches of autonomic nervous system, the development of new non-linear approaches seems to provide a new perspective in investigating neural control of cardiovascular system. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - In 57 normal subjects (age 20-60 years), we analyzed the spontaneous beat-to-beat oscillation in R-R interval during control recumbent position, 90° upright tilt, controlled respiration (n = 16) and acute (n = 10) and chronic (n = 12) β-adrenergic receptor blockade. Automatic computer analysis provided the autoregressive power spectral density, as well as the number and relative power of the individual components. The power spectral density of R-R interval variability contained two major components in power, a high frequency at ~ 0.25 Hz and a low frequency at ~ 0.1 Hz, with a normalized low frequency: high frequency ratio of 3.6 ± 0.7. With tilt, the low-frequency component became largely predominant (90 ± 1%) with a low frequency: high frequency ratio of 21 ± 4. Acute β-adrenergic receptor blockade (0.2 mg/kg IV propranolol) increased variance at rest and markedly blunted the increase in low frequency and low frequency: high frequency ratio induced by tilt. Chronic β-adrenergic receptor blockade (0.6 mg/kg p.o. propranolol, t.i.d.), in addition, reduced low frequency and increased high frequency at rest, while limiting the low frequency: high frequency ratio increase produced by tilt. Controlled respiration produced at rest a marked increase in the high-frequency component, with a reduction of the low-frequency component and of the low frequency: high frequency ratio (0.7 ± 0.1); during tilt, the increase in the low frequency: high frequency ratio (8.3 ± 1.6) was significantly smaller. In seven additional subjects in whom direct high-fidelity arterial pressure was recorded, simultaneous R-R interval and arterial pressure variabilities were examined at rest and during tilt. Also, the power spectral density of arterial pressure variability contained two major components, with a relative low frequency: high frequency ratio at rest of 2.8 ± 0.7, which became 17 ± 5 with tilt. These power spectral density components were numerically similar to those observed in R-R variability. Thus, invasive and noninvasive studies provided similar results. More direct information on the role of cardiac sympathetic nerves on R-R and arterial pressure variabilities was derived from a group of experiments in conscious dogs before and after bilateral stellectomy. Under control conditions, high frequency was predominant and low frequency was very small or absent, owing to a predominant vagal tone. During a 9% decrease in arterial pressure obtained with IV nitroglycerin, there was a marked increase in low frequency, as a result of reflex sympathetic activation. Bilateral stellectomy prevented this low-frequency increase in R-R but not in arterial pressure autospectra, indicating that sympathetic nerves to the heart are instrumental in the genesis of low-frequency oscillations in R-R interval.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN. A randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE. To investigate the effect of muscle relaxant for muscle blood flow at the trunk muscle in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Paraspinal muscle function is widely believed to play a role and considered to be of etiologic significance in LBP, and intramuscular pressure increases and blood flow decreases in the flexion position. Decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin at the trunk muscle is seen in patients with LBP. METHODS. A total of 74 male patients with LBP lasting more than 6 months were randomized to 3 treatment groups: (1) physical therapy only (control) (n = 25), (2) administration of eperisone hydrochloride (EMPP) for 4 weeks (n = 24), and (3) McKenzie therapy (n = 25). The primary outcome variables, observed at 2 and 4 weeks, are the Japanese Orthopedic Association LBP score, visual analogue scale (VAS), Faces Pain Scale-Revised, and SF-36. Intramuscular oxygenation was evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy during lumbar extension and flexion, and oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin were compared. RESULTS. VAS was significantly lower at 4 weeks in the McKenzie group than in the control group. There were no significant changes at 2 weeks in all parameters, however, the relative change of oxygenated hemoglobin during lumbar extension at 4 weeks was significantly higher in the EMPP group when compared with the other 2 groups. The relative change of deoxygenated hemoglobin during lumbar flexion showed a significant difference at 4 weeks in the EMPP group when compared with the control group. CONCLUSION. Administration of EMPP for 4 weeks improved the LBP in VAS, though not as effective as McKenzie therapy. Our data demonstrated the effects of eperisone hydrochloride on paraspinal muscle hemodynamics improving intramuscular oxygenation during lumbar extension and flexion in patients with chronic LBP. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Higher parasympathetic activity is related to lower pain perception in healthy subjects and pain patients. We aimed to examine whether this relationship depends on sex, in healthy subjects. Parasympathetic activity was assessed using time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability indices and deep breathing ratio. Pain perception parameters, consisting of heat pain thresholds and pain ratings of supra-thresholds stimuli, as well as pain modulation parameters of mechanical temporal summation, pain adaptation, offset analgesia and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) response were examined. Forty healthy subjects were examined (20 men). Women demonstrated higher parasympathetic activity compared to men (high frequency power of 0.55 ± 0.2 and 0.40 ± 0.2, respectively, p=0.02) and less pain reduction in the offset analgesia paradigm (-35.4 ±29.1 and -55.0 ±31.2, respectively, p=0.046). Separate slopes models analyses revealed sex differences such that a significant negative correlation was observed between higher rMSSD (the root mean square of successive differences) and higher pain adaptation in men (r=-0.649, p=0.003) but not in women (r=0.382, p=0.106). Similarly, a significant negative correlation was found between higher rMSSD and higher efficiency of the CPM response in men (r=-0.510, p=0.026) but not in women (r=0.406, p = 0.085). Sex hormones levels, psychological factors or baseline autonomic activity can be possible explanations for these sex differences. Future autonomic interventions destined to change pain modulation should consider sex as an important intervening factor.

N2  - Prolonged periods of walking have been associated with musculoskeletal discomfort and injuries. Previous research has shown that muscle fatigue is related to decreases in muscle oxygenation during short term walking. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the impact of prolonged walking with intermittent standing on musculoskeletal discomfort and muscle oxygenation measures in young adults. Nine young adults walked for a period of 2 hours. Ratings of perceived discomfort were recorded using a questionnaire. Muscle oxygenation and hemoglobin levels were collected from the lower back erector spinae and soleus muscles using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Subjective discomfort significantly increased throughout the 2 hours. Prolonged walking generally induced increased oxygenation of the erector spinae and soleus across walking periods, within walking periods and across standing periods. These increases were more pronounced at the beginning of the walking session and continued through the second or third periods. Erector spinae and soleus total hemoglobin increased within walking period one and two. Only the soleus total hemoglobin significantly increased after the first walking and standing periods and during all the transitions from walking to standing. Increased oxygenation and total hemoglobin during prolonged walking with intermittent standing are likely a result of the repeated dynamic contractions and exercise-induced blood volume expansion. Increased discomfort was found; however, this was not explained by detrimental changes in oxygenation or total hemoglobin.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether erector spinae muscle oxygenation (OXY) and blood volume during a progressive isoinertial lifting evaluation (PILE) are modified by an exercise therapy program. Design: Pre- (t1) and post- (t2) exercise therapy experimental design. Setting: Hospital. Participants: Subjects with chronic low back pain (LBP group) (n=24) and healthy subjects (control group) (n=24) were evaluated. Intervention: Exercise program. Main Outcome Measures: The control group was evaluated once, and the LBP group was evaluated before (t1) the exercise therapy program and 28 days thereafter (t2). The maximal load lifted, total work, and total power were determined using the PILE test. Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure OXY and blood volume during the PILE test. Results: The maximal load lifted, total power, and total work were significantly lower in the LBP group (-42%±5%, -46%±6%, and -67%±6% at t1, respectively; P<.05) than the control group. In the LBP subjects, these parameters improved significantly after the exercise therapy program (+20%±3%, +56%±4%, and +61%±5%; P<.05). At each submaximal power (ie, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of maximal load lifted at t1), OXY and blood volume were significantly higher at t2 than t1. One-half recovery time for OXY was significantly higher in the LBP group (at t1 and t2) than in control subjects. Conclusions: The findings in this study suggest that LBP subjects present an impairment in their capacity to deliver oxygen at the level of the erector spinae muscle, which can be partly restored by an exercise therapy program. © 2013 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to confirm the trends in right and left side muscle blood volume (Mbv) and muscle oxygenation (Mox) during the Biering-Sorensen muscular endurance (BSME) test, compare right and left side Mbv and Mox responses, and predict BSME time via Mox variables. Research suggests that during moderate intensity (∼20% of maximal volitional contraction) muscle contraction blood flow will decrease as a result of increased intramuscular pressure. Moreover, decreased muscle oxygenation is believed to be associated with diminished musculoskeletal endurance time, but until the development of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) it was not possible to non-invasively monitor these changes in erector spinae muscle. Nineteen healthy males completed the BSME in a prone position. The NIRS probes were placed on the left and right erector spinae muscle at the third lumbar vertebra level. The test protocol was: 2 min resting baseline, BSME to volitional fatigue, and 4 min recovery. The results indicated Mbv initially increased reaching asymptote before returning to baseline at termination. The Mox increased then declined systematically until BSME termination, returning to near baseline in recovery. No significant difference between sides was noted for Mbv or Mox. Mox best predicted BSME time. In conclusion, Mbv increased and then reaches asymptote as indicated in previous research, and oxygen availability was associated with the duration of erector spinae static contraction. Thus, prolonged static postures using the erector spinae muscles may diminish muscle oxygenation increasing susceptible to fatigue and injury. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

N2  - Aims: The neuropathophysiology of a debilitating chronic urologic pain condition, bladder pain syndrome (BPS), remains unknown. Our recent data suggests withdrawal of cardiovagal modulation in subjects with BPS, in contrast to sympathetic nervous system dysfunction in another chronic pelvic pain syndrome, myofascial pelvic pain (MPP). We evaluated whether comorbid disorders differentially associated with BPS vs MPP shed additional light on these autonomic differences. Methods: We compared the presence and relative time of onset of 27 other medical conditions in women with BPS, MPP, both syndromes, and healthy subjects. Analysis included an adjustment for multiple comparisons. Results: Among 107 female subjects (BPS alone = 32; BPS with MPP = 36; MPP alone = 9; healthy controls = 30), comorbidities differentially associated with BPS included irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), dyspepsia, and chronic nausea, whereas those associated with MPP included migraine headache and dyspepsia, consistent with the distinct autonomic neurophysiologic signatures of the two disorders. PTSD (earliest), anxiety, depression, migraine headache, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and IBS usually preceded BPS or MPP. PTSD and the presence of both pelvic pain disorders in the same subject correlated with significantly increased comorbid burden. Conclusions: Our study suggests a distinct pattern of comorbid conditions in women with BPS. These findings further support our hypothesis of primary vagal defect in BPS as compared with primary sympathetic defect in MPP, suggesting a new model for chronic these pelvic pain syndromes. Chronologically, PTSD, migraine, dysmenorrhea, and IBS occurred early, supporting a role for PTSD or its trigger in the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain.

N2  - Background context: There is little information about the simultaneous changes of intramuscular pressure (IMP) and oxygen saturation (StO2) of the paraspinal muscle under various conditions of posture and load. Purpose: To measure simultaneously and compare IMP and StO2 across a range of static trunk postures commonly observed during normal work tasks. Study design: A prospective study using a repeated-measure design in clinical setting. Patient sample: Sixteen healthy young men with no history of back pain. Outcome measures: Simultaneous measurements of IMP by a flexible slit catheter and StO2 by near infrared spectroscopy of the multifidus muscle were performed. Methods: The two measures were taken in six static posture tasks: standing upright and bending forward with and without load (20 kg), bending backward and during a sustained isometric contraction (ie, Sorensen test). To compare the influence of the tasks on IMP and StO2 variables, a one-way variance analysis with repeated measures was used. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) was determined between the two variables for each posture task. Results: We observed only a moderate but significant correlation between IMP and StO2 values in upright standing and a trend in bending forward positions with load (p<.05). IMP increased in the bending backward position and showed the greatest increase during the Sorensen test. StO2 decreased significantly during the Sorensen test, in the bending forward position with and without load bearing but did not in bending backward. Conclusion: The simultaneous recording of IMP and StO2 of the multifidus muscle allows a deeper insight of physiological events during various trunk postures. In the mutifidus muscle, there is no evident linear relationship between IMP and StO2 values in various static postures of the trunk in young males. This preliminary study shows that IMP may play a role on StO2 only in some circumstances, such as a prolonged endurance test or in a bending forward position with a significant load bearing. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background. Although attention has been paid to the relationship between the changes in blood circulation in erector spinae muscles and back pain, little is known about their hemodynamics in several various comparable postures with and without loading. Studies on hemodynamics of erector spinae muscles using near-infrared spectroscopy have been performed on subjects and patients mainly in forward flexion positions. Methods. Two near-infrared spectroscopes were used to measure oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin in bilateral erector spinae muscles at L2-3 in subjects in 9 postures, and holding no load, 10 kg or 20 kg in maximum flexed and lateral bending. Those three values in each posture and loading condition were expressed as a percentage of their corresponding values obtained in the standing upright position, and designated and statistically analyzed as %Oxy-Hb, %Deoxy-Hb and %Total-Hb, respectively. Findings. %Total-Hb and %Oxy-Hb in maximum flexion were the most decreased. In maximum lateral bending, %Oxy-Hb only in the contralateral erector spinae muscles was decreased. When the load was 20 kg, the decreases in %Oxy-Hb were the largest in maximum flexion and lateral bendings. Interpretation. Using two near-infrared spectroscopes allowed us to measure simultaneously the hemodynamics of bilateral muscles. They demonstrated different responses in each side. Asymmetrical posture and loading were accompanied by asymmetrical changes of the bilateral erector spinae muscles. Stretched muscle had less blood volume and oxygenation, both of which decreased with increasing load. These results showed that these postures and conditions might lead to fatigue of the ES muscles. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. There is little information about the relationship between the changes of hemodynamics and the morphologic changes of the erector spinae muscle. Methods. Fifty healthy male volunteers participated. Ultrasonography was used to measure muscle thickness, and near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure tissue blood volume and its oxygenation in the erector spinae muscle at L3 in six different relaxed trunk postures (flexed 20°, flexed 40°, flexed maximum, neutral posture, extended 20°, and extended maximum of the lumbar spine). We also evaluated the reproducibility of the near-infrared spectroscopy measurements. Findings. Near-infrared spectroscopy gave highly reproducible measurements. The thickness of the erector spinae muscle and the total and oxygenated hemoglobin were simultaneously increased during relaxed extension and decreased during relaxed flexion. Changes in the thickness of the erector spinae muscle with various lumbar curvature were similar in pattern to the changes in tissue blood volume and its oxygenation. Interpretation. The erector spinae muscles' thickness, tissue blood volume, and its oxygenation are simultaneously increased during relaxed extension and decreased during relaxed flexion, as demonstrated by non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy and ultrasonography. These findings might afford a better understanding of the pathomechanics of posture-related back symptoms. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Musicians report a high prevalence of annual musculoskeletal pain (86–89%), attributed to prolonged playing times consisting of repetitive static and dynamic muscle activity. The aim of this study was to explore, compare and synthesise evidence on electromyographic (EMG) muscle activity in neck, shoulder and spinal musculature between painful and asymptomatic instrumental musicians. Ovid, Wiley, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched in August 2016 for cross-sectional studies that compared EMG activity of neck, shoulder and spinal musculature between musicians with musculoskeletal pain and asymptomatic comparisons. An updated search was performed in May 2017, adding a further study. Two authors independently assessed papers for inclusion and then quality, determined using a modified Downs and Black Checklist. Means and standard deviations were extracted from each study to calculate effect sizes and compare results. Six studies were found to fulfil inclusion criteria. Five studies were deemed high-quality with one being low-quality. Conflicting evidence was found supporting increases in upper trapezius EMG muscle activity in musicians reporting of pain. Moderate-quality evidence indicates increased SCM activity in musicians reporting pain. There was limited evidence supporting increased activity of deltoids, lower trapezius and the upper cervical extensors in musicians reporting of musculoskeletal pain. Meta-analysis of results of three studies assessing upper trapezius activity were conflicting with these not being statistically significant. Further studies with prospective designs, larger population sizes and on broader instrumental groups are warranted.

N2  - © 2018 Elsevier Ltd Background: Myofascial release (MFR) is used to restore tissue extensibility of the fascia tissue and is considered to be useful in a number of clinical settings such as low back pain, ankle injuries, fibromyalgia, and headaches. There is, however, despite the popularity of MFR in manual therapy, little consensus on whether it leads to biomechanical, systemic or interoceptive outcomes. Aims: This study aimed to explore the immediate biomechanical (increased elasticity for increased range of motion), systemic (local vs. distal areas of pain threshold) and bodily awareness effects (interoception) of a myofascial release technique on the thoracic spine. Method: Twelve healthy participants took part in this triple-bind, repeated measures, cross-over design study, and were randomised into counterbalanced sequences of three conditions; a control, a sham, and the MFR condition. The outcome measures used were; range of motion (ROM), pain pressure thresholds (PPT), and interoceptive sensitivity (IS) to assess biomechanical, systemic, and interoceptive effects of MFR. Results: There were significant increases in ROM and PPT (both local and distal) post MFR intervention. There was also a positive correlation between baseline interoceptive sensitivity and post-MFR ROM and a negative correlation for baseline interoceptive sensitivity and post-MRF PPT. Interoceptive sensitivity did increase post-MFR but this was non-significant. Conclusions: The increase in ROM suggests that the MFR may have caused a biomechanical change in tissue elasticity creating an increase in tissue flexibility. The increase in both local and distal sites of the PPT suggest an overall systemic response to the therapy. The correlation between baseline IS and post-MFR ROM and PPT suggest that IS may be usefully applied as a predictor for ROM and PPT post-MFR.

N2  - © 2019 Elsevier Ltd Background: There is paucity in the literature regarding the role of interoceptive accuracy (IAc) at predicting the effectiveness of osteopathic techniques which increase spinal mobility when directed specifically at the thoracolumbar junction (TLJ). Aims: The study aimed to explore whether a high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust of the TLJ would increase spinal mobility (measured through Range of Motion; ROM) and change IAc. Also, whether baseline IAc correlated with the post-ROM measures and change in ROM. Method: 21 asymptomatic participants were allocated into three conditions in a randomised order. These were; (1) a high velocity low amplitude manipulation of the TLJ; (2) sham (basic touch); and (3) a control (laying supine on a plinth). Before and following each intervention, the participants’ spinal ROM was measured using an Acumar digital inclinometer. In addition to this an ECG was used to measure their pre and post condition IAc. Results: There were significant increases in ROM for all condition, however, the HVLA thrust led to a significantly greater increase in ROM (p < 0.001) when compared to the control and sham. Baseline IAc was inversely associated with post-ROM but there was no association with change in ROM. The HVLA thrust did not significantly change IAc scores from pre to post intervention. Conclusions. HVLA thrust over the TLJ is a useful intervention for increasing spinal ROM. IAc maybe a useful predictor for intervention effectiveness of this technique and spinal area which could in the future be utilised by osteopaths as part of their diagnostics.

N2  - Visceral manual therapy is increasingly used by UK osteopaths and manual therapists, but there is a paucity of research investigating its underlying mechanisms, and in particular in relation to hypoalgesia. The aim of this study was to investigate the immediate effects of osteopathic visceral mobilisation on pressure pain thresholds. A single-blinded, randomised, within subjects, repeated measures design was conducted on 15 asymptomatic subjects. Pressure pain thresholds were measured at the L1 paraspinal musculature and 1st dorsal interossei before and after osteopathic visceral mobilisation of the sigmoid colon. The results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pressure pain thresholds immediately after the intervention (P< 0.001). This effect was not observed to be systemic, affecting only the L1 paraspinal musculature. This novel study provides new experimental evidence that visceral manual therapy can produce immediate hypoalgesia in somatic structures segmentally related to the organ being mobilised, in asymptomatic subjects. © 2012.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN. A case control study. OBJECTIVES. Using metabolic gas analysis and near infrared spectroscopy, a comparison was made between healthy controls and chronic low back pain (LBP) participants on cardiorespiratory, erector spinae muscle blood volume, and oxygenation responses, and these variables were used to determine factors that best predict peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. To date, it is unknown how the cardiorespiratory and erector spinae muscles of chronic LBP persons respond to repetitive incremental lifting and lowering. With the advent of near infrared spectroscopy technology, it is now possible to noninvasively examine erector spinae muscle oxygen supply and utilization in vivo. Thus, by using metabolic gas analysis and near infrared spectroscopy technology simultaneously, it is now possible to compare the cardiorespiratory and erector spinae muscle responses of chronic LBP participants to that of healthy controls (no history of LBP) during incremental work to volitional fatigue. METHODS. Thirty-four participants with chronic LBP and 34 healthy controls completed the repetitive incremental lifting and lowering (2.25 kg • min) protocol from floor to table (height 76 cm) at 10 lifts • min to voluntary fatigue. RESULTS. The healthy controls had significantly greater VO2peak (mL • kg • min) and VO2peak (mL • kgLBM • min), peak mass lifted, test duration, and breathing frequency. Furthermore, healthy controls showed significantly greater change in muscle oxygenation and faster one-half recovery times. Multiple regression analysis indicated that approximately 97% of the variance in absolute VO2peak was predicted by cardiorespiratory variables in both groups, while muscle oxygenation aided in predicting VO2peak relative in the LBP participants. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicated that the chronic LBP participants demonstrated a reduced cardiorespiratory and erector spinae muscle response during repetitive incremental lifting and lowering to volitional fatigue as compared to the healthy controls. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - participantes são convidados a dar respostas e a solicitar informações adicionais, se assim o desejarem. Esta atividade traz grandes benefícios aos pacientes e proporciona maior reconhecimento ao farmacêutico; o paciente torna-se capaz de reconhecer a necessidade dos medicamentos para a manutenção de sua saúde e bem estar. Além disso, fortalece o relacionamento entre o profissional da saúde e o paciente, o que cria uma atmosfera de confiança e pode aumentar a adesão ao tratamento. 7 Embora haja entendimento corrente de que o objetivo do acon-selhamento seja a promoção da adesão, esta abordagem está sendo substituída por um modelo mais recente de interação entre profissio-nal da saúde e paciente, denominado concordância. A concordância é fundamentada em um novo conceito de trans-missão de informação entre o farmacêutico e o paciente. Nesta abor-dagem, o papel do farmacêutico é apoiar o paciente na construção do seu próprio conhecimento e de atitudes com vistas ao uso dos seus medicamentos. O paciente deve ser considerado como um conhece-dor de sua própria doença e do medicamento utilizado, sendo orien-tado nesse sentido. Contudo, isto não minimiza o papel do farmacêu-tico como especialista no uso de medicamentos, mas, ao contrário, favorece uma significativa interação entre ele e o paciente, necessária para promover e apoiar o convívio adequado com a doença. No aconselhamento ao paciente, o farmacêutico pode orientá-lo sobre o uso correto dos medicamentos prescritos e não prescritos, com vistas a melhorar os efeitos terapêuticos e reduzir a probabilida-de de aparecimento de efeitos adversos e toxicidade. Pode também informar sobre cuidados com a saúde e higiene de modo a prevenir complicações e doenças e/ou melhorar seu estado geral. O aconse-lhamento pode ser focado em um paciente individual, geralmente com base em uma receita específica, ou ser direcionado a grupos de auto-ajuda, grupos de portadores de doenças específicas, turmas de escolares, associação de moradores ou outros. O aconselhamento deve criar condições para que se estabeleça uma interação satisfatória em que não apenas sejam oferecidas in-formações, mas que também seja um espaço para que os pacientes verbalizem suas dúvidas, dificuldades e necessidades. 3.

N2  - Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) is an emerging technology for measuring intervertebral motion patterns to investigate problem back pain and degenerative disc disease. This International Forum was a networking event of three research groups (UK, US, Hong Kong), over three days in San Francisco in August 2009. Its aim was to reach a consensus on how best to record, analyse, and communicate QF information for research and clinical purposes. The Forum recommended that images should be acquired during regular trunk motion that is controlled for velocity and range, in order to minimise externally imposed variability as well as to correlate intervertebral motion with trunk motion. This should be done in both the recumbent passive and weight bearing active patient configurations. The main recommended outputs from QF were the true ranges of intervertebral rotation and translation, neutral zone laxity and the consistency of shape of the motion patterns. The main clinical research priority should initially be to investigate the possibility of mechanical subgroups of patients with chronic, nonspecific low back pain by comparing their intervertebral motion patterns with those of matched healthy controls.

N2  - Muscle strengthening exercises are commonly used in primary care for the treatment of chronic, non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) as it has been theorised that increased muscle activity contributes to the stabilisation of inter-vertebral motion segments during bending and other spinal movements, however this has never been demonstrated in vivo. This study used contemporaneous quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) and surface electromyography (sEMG) to investigate relationships between continuous inter-vertebral motion variables and muscle electrical activity in the lumbar multifidus (LMU), lumbar and thoracic erector spinae (LES and TES) during standardised lumbar flexion and return in 18 healthy male human subjects. Our results demonstrated that the variability in the sharing of angular motion (i.e. Motion Share Variability MSV) and motion segment laxity during a bending task were significantly (p < 0.05) negatively correlated (Spearman) with muscle electrical activity throughout the participant bend for both locally and globally acting muscle groups. MSV was also strongly correlated with L2-3 laxity. The former suggests a damping mechanism reducing irregular displacements (i.e. less variability in the sharing of segmental motion) during bending and an action of spinal stabilisation by muscles at segmental levels, and the latter a synergy between laxity at L2-3 and MSV. While this has previously been theorised, it has never been shown in vivo at the inter-vertebral level. These assessments may be considered for use in validation studies of exercise programs for CNSLBP, however further replication is required.

N2  - Spinal manipulation is a commonly sought therapy for neck pain. The present work examined sagittal plane cervical inter-vertebral kinematics in patients and healthy volunteers to explore whether motion is different in patients with neck pain, if manipulation is associated with changing cervical kinematics, and if changes are related to patient-reported outcomes. A standardised quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) image acquisition protocol for the cervical spine was developed and tested. A model of a cervical segment with a rigidly fitted digital inclinometer was rotated in the sagittal plane whilst being fluoroscopically imaged and QF results were compared for accuracy to that of the inclinometer. QF imaging sequences from ten subjects were analysed twice, six weeks apart, to assess repeatability. Finally, 30 patients and 30 age/gender-matched healthy volunteers had two cervical spine QF assessments four weeks apart. Only patients received spinal manipulation and completed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Kinematic variables of interest included IV-RoM, segmental hypo-mobility, paradoxical motion, instantaneous axis of rotation (IAR) location, and laxity/attainment rate. The acquisition protocol allowed for imaging sequences to be achieved in a manner acceptable to participants. QF was found to be accurate to 0.5° for rotational range of motion. Intra- and inter-observer repeatability studies revealed substantial agreement and reliability for the QF measurement of C1 to C6 rotational motion (largest standard error of measurement (SEM) = 1.14°, lowest intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.895) but not for IAR location (largest SEM = 7.66mm, lowest ICC = -0.080). Agreement and reliability were moderate-substantial for laxity/attainment rate (largest SEM = 0.04, lowest ICC = 0.70). There were no significant differences at baseline between patients and healthy volunteers in IV-RoM, or in the number of hypo-mobile, paradoxical or lax motion segments. Spinal manipulation was weakly associated with IV-RoM increases above the minimum detectable change calculated from healthy volunteers, in a dose response manner (Rho = 0.39 (95% CI: 0.014 to 0.663) p = 0.04). While the majority (87%) of patients reported clinically significant reductions in pain and disability, changes in IV-RoM were not correlated with any of the PROMs measured.

N2  - Low back pain patients are sometimes offered fusion surgery if intervertebral translation, measured from static, end of range radiographs exceeds 3 mm. However, it is essential to know the measurement error of such methods, if selection for back surgery is going to be informed by them. Fifty-five healthy male (34) and female (21) pain free participants aged 21–80 years received quantitative fluoroscopic (QF) imaging both actively during standing and passively in the lateral decubitus position. The following five imaging protocols were extracted from 2 motion examinations, which were repeated 6 weeks apart: 1. Static during upright free bending. 2. Maximum during controlled upright bending, 3. At the end of controlled upright bending, 4. Maximum during controlled recumbent bending, 5. At the end of controlled recumbent bending. Intervertebral flexion translations from L2-S1 were determined for each protocol and their measurement errors (intra subject repeatability) calculated. Estimations using static, free bending radiographic images gave measurement errors of up to 4 mm, which was approximately twice that of the QF protocols. Significantly higher ranges at L4-5 and L5-S1 were obtained from the static protocol compared with the QF protocols. Weight bearing ranges at these levels were also significantly higher in males regardless of the protocol. Clinical decisions based on sagittal translations of less than 4 mm would therefore require QF imaging.

N2  - The diagnosis of lumbar spine pathologies such as lower back pain (LBP) is extremely difficult, and a consensus regarding a diagnostic standard has not yet been reached. Accurate measurement of intervertebral kinematic parameters helps to understand the etiology and diagnosis of related diseases, and to evaluate the subsequent treatment. Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) which can obtain continuous, dynamic image sequences of lumbar motion at low radiation doses were introduced. The estimation of intervertebral kinematics depends on the precise localization of lumbar vertebrae. Usually, vertebral corners are identified and tracked by automated methods or manual method. This study presents a novel method for vertebral tracking based on the KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi, KLT) algorithm for intervertebral kinematics analysis. Accuracy of the proposed method was tested using a sagittal human image which contained two vertebral bodies, and the average errors achieved for displacement and angle were within 0.25 mm and 0.3° respectively. To test the proposed method under clinical conditions, totally 11 volunteers were recruited and a result of more smoothness and stability in the intervertebral kinematics was obtained with comparing to the manual method by an experienced and trained clinician. In conclusion, the proposed method is an effective, accurate way to assess lumbar vertebrae tracking.

N2  - Background: Lumbar segmental instability is often considered to be a cause of chronic low back pain. However, defining its measurement has been largely limited to laboratory studies. These have characterised segmental stability as the intrinsic resistance of spine specimens to initial bending moments by quantifying the dynamic neutral zone. However these measurements have been impossible to obtain in vivo without invasive procedures, preventing the assessment of intervertebral stability in patients. Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF), measures the initial velocity of the attainment of intervertebral rotational motion in patients, which may to some extent be representative of the dynamic neutral zone. This study sought to explore the possible relationship between the dynamic neutral zone and intervertebral rotational attainment rate as measured with (QF) in an in vitro preparation. The purpose was to find out if further work into this concept is worth pursuing. Method: This study used passive recumbent QF in a multi-segmental porcine model. This assessed the intrinsic intervertebral responses to a minimal coronal plane bending moment as measured with a digital force guage. Bending moments about each intervertebral joint were calculated and correlated with the rate at which global motion was attained at each intervertebral segment in the first 10° of global motion where the intervertebral joint was rotating. Results: Unlike previous studies of single segment specimens, a neutral zone was found to exist during lateral bending. The initial attainment rates for left and right lateral flexion were comparable to previously published in vivo values for healthy controls. Substantial and highly significant levels of correlation between initial attainment rate and neutral zone were found for left (Rho = 0.75, P = 0.0002) and combined left-right bending (Rho = 0.72, P = 0.0001) and moderate ones for right alone (Rho = 0.55, P = 0.0012). Conclusions: This study found good correlation between the initial intervertebral attainment rate and the dynamic neutral zone, thereby opening the possibility to detect segmental instability from clinical studies. However the results must be treated with caution. Further studies with multiple specimens and adding sagittal plane motion are warranted.

N2  - Introduction: Identifying biomechanical subgroups in chronic, non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) populations from inter-vertebral displacements has proven elusive. Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) has excellent repeatability and provides continuous standardised inter-vertebral kinematic data from fluoroscopic sequences allowing assessment of mid-range motion. The aim of this study was to determine whether proportional continuous IV rotational patterns were different in patients and controls. A secondary aim was to update the repeatability of QF measurement of range of motion (RoM) for inter-vertebral (IV) rotation.
Methods and Materials: Fluoroscopic sequences were recorded of passive, recumbent coronal and sagittal motion, which was controlled for range and velocity. Segments L2–5 in 40 primary care CNSLBP patients and 40 matched controls were compared. Patients also completed the von Korff Chronic Pain Grade and Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire. Sequences were processed using automated image tracking algorithms to extract continuous inter-vertebral rotation data. These were converted to continuous proportional ranges of rotation (PR). The continuous proportional range variances were calculated for each direction and combined to produce a single variable representing their fluctuation (CPRV). Inter- and intra-rater repeatability were also calculated for the maximum IV-RoM measurements obtained during controlled trunk motion to provide an updated indication of the reliability and agreement of QF for measuring spine kinematics.
Results: CPRV was significantly higher in patients (0.011 vs. 0.008, Mann–Whitney two-sided p = 0.008), implying a mechanical subgroup. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found its sensitivity and specificity to be 0.78 % (60–90) and 0.55 % (37–73), respectively (area under the curve 0.672). CPRV was not correlated with pain severity or disability. The repeatability of maximum inter-vertebral range was excellent, but range was only significantly greater in patients at L4–5 in right side bending (p = 0.03).
Conclusion: The variation in proportional motion between lumbar vertebrae during passive recumbent trunk motion was greater in patients with CNSLBP than in matched healthy controls, indicating that biomechanical factors in passive structures play a part.

N2  - Background: Disc height loss and osteophytes change the local mechanical environment in the spine; while previous research has examined kinematic dysfunction under degenerative change, none has looked at the influence of disc height loss and osteophytes throughout movement. Methods: Twenty patients with pain related to the head, neck or shoulders were imaged via videofluoroscopy as they underwent sagittal-plane flexion and extension. A clinician graded disc height loss and osteophytes as “severe/moderate” “mild” or “none”. A novel tracking algorithm quantified motions of each vertebra. This information was used to calculate intervertebral angular and shear displacements. The digital algorithm made it practical to track individual vertebrae in multiple patients through hundreds of images without bias. Findings: Cases without height loss/osteophytes had a consistent increase in intervertebral angular displacement from C2/C3 to C5/C6, like that of healthy individuals, and mild height losses did not produce aberrations that were systematic or necessarily discernable. However, joints with moderate to severe disc height loss and osteophytes exhibited reduced range of motion compared to adjacent unaffected joints in that patient and corresponding joints in patients without structural irregularities. Interpretation: Digitally-obtained motion histories of individual joints allowed anatomical joint changes to be linked with changes in joint movement patterns. Specifically, disc height loss and osteophytes were found to influence cervical spine movement in the sagittal plane, reducing angular motions at affected joints by approximately 10% between those with and without height loss and osteophytes. Further, these joint changes were associated with perturbed intervertebral angular and shear movements.

N2  - In order to improve understanding of the complex interactions between spinal sub-systems (i.e., the passive (ligaments, discs, fascia and bones), the active (muscles and tendons) and the neural control systems), it is necessary to take a dynamic approach that incorporates the measurement of multiple systems concurrently. There are currently no reviews of studies that have investigated dynamic sagittal bending movements using a combination of electromyography (EMG) and lumbar kinematic measurements. As such it is not clear how understanding of spinal stability concepts has advanced with regards to this functional movement of the spine. The primary aim of this review was therefore to evaluate how such studies have contributed to improved understanding of lumbar spinal stability mechanisms. PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched using combinations of the keywords related to spinal stability and sagittal bending tasks, using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Whilst examples of the interactions between the passive and active sub-systems were shown, typically small sample sizes meant that results were not generalizable. The majority of studies used regional kinematic measurements, and whilst this was appropriate in terms of individual study aims, the studies could not provide insight into sub-system interaction at the level of the spinal motion segment. In addition, the heterogeneity in methodologies made comparison between studies difficult. The review suggests that since Panjabi’s seminal spinal control papers, only limited advancement in the understanding of these theories has been provided by the studies under review, particularly at an inter-segmental level. This lack of progression indicates a requirement for new research approaches that incorporate multiple system measurements at a motion segment level.

N2  - The development and implementation of quantitative imaging biomarkers has been hampered by the inconsistent and often incorrect use of terminology related to these markers. Sponsored by the Radiological Society of North America, an interdisciplinary group of radiologists, statisticians, physicists, and other researchers worked to develop a comprehensive terminology to serve as a foundation for quantitative imaging biomarker claims. Where possible, this working group adapted existing definitions derived from national or international standards bodies rather than invent new definitions for these terms. This terminology also serves as a foundation for the design of studies that evaluate the technical performance of quantitative imaging biomarkers and for studies of algorithms that generate the quantitative imaging biomarkers from clinical scans. This paper provides examples of research studies and quantitative imaging biomarker claims that use terminology consistent with these definitions as well as examples of the rampant confusion in this emerging field. We provide recommendations for appropriate use of quantitative imaging biomarker terminological concepts. It is hoped that this document will assist researchers and regulatory reviewers who examine quantitative imaging biomarkers and will also inform regulatory guidance. More consistent and correct use of terminology could advance regulatory science, improve clinical research, and provide better care for patients who undergo imaging studies.

N2  - Sensitization of the nervous system can present as pain hypersensitivity that may contribute to clinical pain. In spinal pain, however, the relationship between sensory hypersensitivity and clinical pain remains unclear. This systematic review examined the relationship between pain sensitivity measured via quantitative sensory testing (QST) and self-reported pain or pain-related disability in people with spinal pain. Electronic databases and reference lists were searched. Correlation coefficients for the relationship between QST and pain intensity or disability were pooled using random effects models. Subgroup analyses and mixed effects meta-regression were used to assess whether the strength of the relationship was moderated by variables related to the QST method or pain condition. One hundred and forty-five effect sizes from 40 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimates for the correlation between pain threshold and pain intensity were -0.15 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.18 to -0.11) and for disability -0.16 (95% CI: -0.22 to -0.10). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression did not provide evidence that these relationships were moderated by the QST testing site (primary pain/remote), pain condition (back/neck pain), pain type (acute/chronic), or type of pain induction stimulus (eg, mechanical/thermal). Fair correlations were found for the relationship between pain intensity and thermal temporal summation (0.26, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.42) or pain tolerance (-0.30, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.13), but only a few studies were available. Our study indicates either that pain threshold is a poor marker of central sensitization or that sensitization does not play a major role in patients' reporting of pain and disability.

N2  - Objective: To assess the benefits and harms of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Data sources: Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Index to Chiropractic Literature, and trial registries up to 4 May 2018, including reference lists of eligible trials and related reviews. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomised controlled trials examining the effect of spinal manipulation or mobilisation in adults (≥18 years) with chronic low back pain with or without referred pain. Studies that exclusively examined sciatica were excluded, as was grey literature. No restrictions were applied to language or setting. Review methods: Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The effect of SMT was compared with recommended therapies, non-recommended therapies, sham (placebo) SMT, and SMT as an adjuvant therapy. Main outcomes were pain and back specific functional status, examined as mean differences and standardised mean differences (SMD), respectively. Outcomes were examined at 1, 6, and 12 months. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. A random effects model was used and statistical heterogeneity explored. Results: 47 randomised controlled trials including a total of 9211 participants were identified, who were on average middle aged (35-60 years). Most trials compared SMT with recommended therapies. Moderate quality evidence suggested that SMT has similar effects to other recommended therapies for short term pain relief (mean difference -3.17, 95% confidence interval -7.85 to 1.51) and a small, clinically better improvement in function (SMD -0.25, 95% confidence interval -0.41 to -0.09). High quality evidence suggested that compared with non-recommended therapies SMT results in small, not clinically better effects for short term pain relief (mean difference -7.48, -11.50 to -3.47) and small to moderate clinically better improvement in function (SMD -0.41, -0.67 to -0.15). In general, these results were similar for the intermediate and long term outcomes as were the effects of SMT as an adjuvant therapy. Evidence for sham SMT was low to very low quality; therefore these effects should be considered uncertain. Statistical heterogeneity could not be explained. About half of the studies examined adverse and serious adverse events, but in most of these it was unclear how and whether these events were registered systematically. Most of the observed adverse events were musculoskeletal related, transient in nature, and of mild to moderate severity. One study with a low risk of selection bias and powered to examine risk (n=183) found no increased risk of an adverse event (relative risk 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.81) or duration of the event (1.13, 0.59 to 2.18) compared with sham SMT. In one study, the Data Safety Monitoring Board judged one serious adverse event to be possibly related to SMT. Conclusion SMT produces similar effects to recommended therapies for chronic low back pain, whereas SMT seems to be better than non-recommended interventions for improvement in function in the short term. Clinicians should inform their patients of the potential risks of adverse events associated with SMT.

N2  - Low-back pain (LBP) is one of the most burdensome health problems in the world. Guidelines recommend simple treatments such as advice that may result in suboptimal outcomes, particularly when applied to people with complex biopsychosocial barriers to recovery. Individualised physiotherapy has the potential of being more effective for people with LBP; however, there is limited evidence supporting this approach. A series of studies supporting the mechanisms underpinning and effectiveness of the Specific Treatment of Problems of the Spine (STOPS) approach to individualised physiotherapy have been published. The clinical and research implications of these findings are presented and discussed. Treatment based on the STOPS approach should also be considered as an approach to individualised physiotherapy in people with LBP.

N2  - Purpose: In vivo quantification of intervertebral motion through imaging has progressed to a point where biomarkers for low back pain are emerging. This makes possible deeper study of the condition’s biometrics. However, the measurement of change over time involves error. The purpose of this prospective investigation is to determine the intrasubject repeatability of six in vivo intervertebral motion parameters using quantitative fluoroscopy. Methods: Intrasubject reliability (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC) of baseline to 6-week follow-up measurements were calculated for six lumbar spine intervertebral motion parameters in 109 healthy volunteers. A standardised quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) protocol was used to provide measurements in the coronal and sagittal planes using both passive recumbent and active weight-bearing motion. Parameters were: intervertebral range of motion (IV-RoM), laxity, motion sharing inequality (MSI), motion sharing variability (MSV), flexion translation and anterior disc height change during flexion. Results: The best overall intrasubject reliability (ICC) and agreement (MDC) were for disc height (ICC 0.89, MDC 43%) and IV-RoM (ICC 0.96, MDC 60%), and the worst for MSV (ICC 0.04, MDC 408%). Laxity, MSI and translation had acceptable reliability (most ICCs > 0.60), but not agreement (MDC > 85%). Conclusion: Disc height and IV-RoM measurement using QF could be considered for randomised trials, while laxity, MSI and translation could be considered for moderators, correlates or mediators of patient-reported outcomes. MSV had both poor reliability and agreement over 6 weeks. Graphical abstract: These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].

N2  - Background: Intervertebral motion impairment is widely thought to be related to chronic back disability, however, the movements of inter-vertebral pairs are not independent of each other and motion may also be related to morphology. Furthermore, maximum intervertebral range of motion (IV-RoMmax) is difficult to measure accurately in living subjects. The purpose of this study was to explore possible relationships between (IV-RoMmax) and lordosis, initial attainment rate and IV-RoMmax at other levels during weight-bearing flexion using quantitative fluoroscopy (QF). Methods: Continuous QF motion sequences were recorded during controlled active sagittal flexion of 60° in 18 males (mean age 27.6 SD 4.4) with no history of low back pain in the previous year. IV-RoMmax, lordotic angle, and initial attainment rate at all inter-vertebral levels from L2-S1 were extracted. Relationships between IV-RoMmax and the other variables were explored using correlation coefficients, and simple linear regression was used to determine the effects of any significant relationships. Within and between observer repeatability of IV-RoMmax and initial attainment rate measurements were assessed in a sub-set of ten participants, using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Results: QF measurements were highly repeatable, the lowest ICC for IV-RoMmax, being 0.94 (0.80-0.99) and highest SEM (0.76°). For initial attainment rate the lowest ICC was 0.84 (0.49-0.96) and the highest SEM (0.036). The results also demonstrated significant positive and negative correlations between IV-RoMmax and IV-RoMmax at other lumbar levels (r = -0.64-0.65), lordosis (r = -0.52-0.54), and initial attainment rate (r = -0.64-0.73). Simple linear regression analysis of all significant relationships showed that these predict between 28 and 42 % of the variance in IV-RoMmax. Conclusions: This study found weak to moderate effects of individual kinematic variables and lumbar lordosis on IV-RoMmax at other intervertebral levels. These effects, when combined, may be important when such levels are being considered by healthcare professionals as potential sources of pain generation. Multivariate investigations in larger samples are warranted.

N2  - Study Design: Observational comparative study. Purpose: To compare fractional anisotropy (FA) maps with T2 values of the nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) of intervertebral discs in healthy volunteers and patients to develop a predictive disc health scale. Overview of Literature: T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not sensitive to early morphological changes and provides no quantitative biomarker profile for early degeneration. Methods: We examined 59 healthy controls and 59 patients with back pain by MRI using T2 relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Each group was divided into three age subgroups: A ( < 30 years, n=12); B (30-50 years, n=26); and C ( > 50 years, n=21). We obtained FA values for AF and NP and T2 values for NP for each intervertebral disc. Furthermore, we calculated the FA (AF/NP) ratios. Results: We categorized 590 intervertebral discs from 118 participants, 566 of which were analyzed with T2 relaxometry and DTI. The T2 values were as follows: subgroup A, 55.8±4.4 ms; B, 48.5±6.9 ms; C, 45.8±8.7 ms (p < 0.050). The T2 values for the healthy controls of the subgroups A, B, and C were > 120 ms, 90-100 ms, and 70 ms, respectively (p < 0.001). Control subgroup A had higher T2 values and AF/NP ratios than subgroups B and C; the AF values were not significantly different. Control subgroup B had higher T2 values and AF/NP ratios than subgroup C but lower FA (NP). Conclusions: FA maps of the AF/NP ratio and T2 values of NP are potential microstructure biomarkers of normal and degenerating discs and can help detect early degeneration using a predictive disc health score on a continuous scale.

N2  - Quantitative biomarkers derived from medical images are being used increasingly to help diagnose disease, guide treatment, and predict clinical outcomes. Measurement of quantitative imaging biomarkers is subject to bias and variability from multiple sources, including the scanner technologies that produce images, the approaches for identifying regions of interest in images, and the algorithms that calculate biomarkers from regions. Moreover, these sources may differ within and between the quantification methods employed by institutions, thus making it difficult to develop and implement multi-institutional standards. We present a Bayesian framework for assessing bias and variability in imaging biomarkers derived from different quantification methods, comparing agreement to a reference standard, studying prognostic performance, and estimating sample size for future clinical studies. The statistical methods are illustrated with data obtained from a positron emission tomography challenge conducted by members of the NCI's Quantitative Imaging Network program, in which tumor volumes were measured manually and with seven different semi-automated segmentation algorithms. Estimates and comparisons of bias and variability in the resulting measurements are provided along with an R software package for the technical performance analysis and an online web application for sample size and power analysis.

N2  - Background Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine is commonly used to identify the source of low back pain (LBP); however, its use has been questionable. Throughout the years, numerous lumbar phenotypes (e.g., endplate abnormalities, Modic changes, black disc) have been studied as possible pain generators. High-intensity zones (HIZs) are of particular interest as they may represent annular tears. However, for over three decades, there has been heated debate as to whether these imaging biomarkers are synonymous with LBP. Therefore, the following study addressed a systematic review of the reported literature addressing the relationship of HIZs and LBP. Methods A systematic review was conducted via MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane, PubMed, PubMed Central, EMBASE via Ovid, and Web of Science with the following search terms: "HIZ," "high intensity zone," or "high intensity zones" and "low back pain," "pain," "lumbago," and/or "sciatica." Specific exclusion criteria were also maintained. Two independent reviewers searched the literature, selected the studies, and extracted the data. Results We identified six studies from our search strategy that met the inclusion criteria from a total of 756 possible studies. One cross-sectional population-based study and five comparison studies were identified, which provided information regarding the prevalence of HIZs. The prevalence of HIZs was 3 to 61% in subjects with LBP and 2 to 3% in subjects without LBP. Only three studies suggested a significant association between the presence of HIZ and LBP with or without sciatica. Conclusions Our systematic review has found evidence that HIZs may be a possible risk factor for LBP; however, a mismatch of the clinical relevance of HIZs between studies still remains. The available evidence is limited by small sample size, heterogeneous study populations, and lack of standardized imaging methods for phenotyping. HIZs may be important lumbar biomarkers that demand further investigation and should be considered in the global imaging assessment of the spine, which may have immense clinical utility. Further large-scale studies with standardized imaging and classification techniques as well as the assessment of patterns of HIZs are necessary to better understand their role with LBP development.

N2  - Introduction: Quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) are being increasingly used in medical practice and clinical trials. An essential first step in the adoption of a quantitative imaging biomarker is the characterization of its technical performance, i.e. precision and bias, through one or more performance studies. Then, given the technical performance, a confidence interval for a new patient’s true biomarker value can be constructed. Estimating bias and precision can be problematic because rarely are both estimated in the same study, precision studies are usually quite small, and bias cannot be measured when there is no reference standard. Methods: A Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to assess factors affecting nominal coverage of confidence intervals for a new patient’s quantitative imaging biomarker measurement and for change in the quantitative imaging biomarker over time. Factors considered include sample size for estimating bias and precision, effect of fixed and non-proportional bias, clustered data, and absence of a reference standard. Results: Technical performance studies of a quantitative imaging biomarker should include at least 35 test–retest subjects to estimate precision and 65 cases to estimate bias. Confidence intervals for a new patient’s quantitative imaging biomarker measurement constructed under the no-bias assumption provide nominal coverage as long as the fixed bias is <12%. For confidence intervals of the true change over time, linearity must hold and the slope of the regression of the measurements vs. true values should be between 0.95 and 1.05. The regression slope can be assessed adequately as long as fixed multiples of the measurand can be generated. Even small non-proportional bias greatly reduces confidence interval coverage. Multiple lesions in the same subject can be treated as independent when estimating precision. Conclusion: Technical performance studies of quantitative imaging biomarkers require moderate sample sizes in order to provide robust estimates of bias and precision for constructing confidence intervals for new patients. Assumptions of linearity and non-proportional bias should be assessed thoroughly.

N2  - As imaging technologies and treatment options continue to advance, imaging outcome measures are becoming increasingly utilized as the basis of making major decisions in new drug development and clinical practice. Quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) are now commonly used for subject selection, response assessment, and safety monitoring. Although quantitative measurements can have many advantages compared with subjective, qualitative endpoints, it is important to recognize that QIBs are measured with error. This study uses Monte Carlo simulation to examine the impact of measurement error on a variety of clinical trial designs as well as to test proposed adjustments for measurement error. The focus is on some of the QIBs currently being studied by the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance. The results show that the ability of QIBs to discriminate between health states and predict patient outcome is attenuated by measurement error; however, the known technical performance characteristics of QIBs can be used to adjust study sample size, control the misinterpretation rate of imaging findings, and establish statistically valid decision thresholds. We conclude that estimates of the precision and bias of a QIB are important for properly designing clinical trials and establishing the level of imaging standardization required.

N2  - Objective: Conflicting associations between imaging biomarkers and pain in knee osteoarthritis (OA) have been reported. A relation between pain and denuded areas of subchondral bone (dABs) has been suggested and this study explores this relationship further by relating the presence, phenotype, location and size of dABs to different measures of knee pain. Methods: 633 right knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) (250 men, age 61.7±9.6yrs, BMI 29.4±4.7kg/m2) were included. Manual segmentation of the femorotibial cartilage plates was performed on 3T coronal fast low angle shot with water excitation (FLASHwe) images. dABs were defined as areas where the subchondral bone was uncovered by cartilage. The following measures of pain were used: weightbearing-, non-weightbearing-, moderate-to-severe-, infrequent- and frequent knee pain. Results: Using pain measures from subjects without dABs as a reference, those with at least one dAB hada 1.64-fold higher prevalence ratio [PR, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-2.18] to have frequent and 1.45-fold higher for moderate-to-severe knee pain (95% CI 1.13-1.85). Subjects with dABs in central subregions had a 1.53-fold increased prevalence of having weightbearing pain (95% CI 1.20-1.97), especially when the central subregion was moderately (>10%) denuded (PR 1.81, 95% CI 1.35-2.42). Individuals with cartilage-loss-type dABs had a slightly higher prevalence (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.27) of having frequent knee pain compared to individuals with intra-chondral-osteophyte-type dABs. Conclusion: This study supports a positive relation between femorotibial dABs and knee pain, especially when the dABs are located centrally (i.e., in weightbearing regions) or when the respective central subregion is moderately denuded. © 2013 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

N2  - The development of quantitative imaging biomarkers in medicine requires automatic delineation of relevant anatomical structures using available imaging data. However, this task is complicated in clinical medicine due to the variation in scanning parameters and protocols, even within a single medical center. Existing literature on automatic image segmentation using MR data is based on the analysis of highly homogenous images obtained using a fixed set of pulse sequence parameters (TR/TE). Unfortunately, algorithms that operate on fixed scanning parameters do not avail themselves to real-world daily clinical use due to the existing variation in scanning parameters and protocols. Thus, it is necessary to develop algorithmic techniques that can address the challenge of MR image segmentation using real clinical data. Toward this goal, we developed a multi-parametric ensemble learning technique to automatically detect and segment lumbar vertebral bodies using MR images of the spine. We use spine imaging data to illustrate our techniques since low back pain is an extremely common condition and a typical spine clinic evaluates patients that have been referred with a wide range of scanning parameters. This method was designed with special emphasis on robustness so that it can perform well despite the inherent variation in scanning protocols. Specifically, we show how a single multi-parameter ensemble model trained with manually labeled T2 scans can autonomously segment vertebral bodies on scans with echo times varying between 24 and 147 ms and relaxation times varying between 1500 and 7810 ms. Furthermore, even though the model was trained using T2-MR imaging data, it can accurately segment vertebral bodies on T1-MR and CT, further demonstrating the robustness and versatility of our methodology. We believe that robust segmentation techniques, such as the one presented here, are necessary for translating computer assisted diagnosis into everyday clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of a pressure algometer to measure pressure pain threshold (PPT) for diagnosis of myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) in the upper extremity and trunk muscles.\n\nMETHOD: A group of 221 desk workers complaining of upper body pain participated in this study. Five physiatrists made the diagnosis of MPS using physical examination and PPT measurements. PPT measurements were determined for several muscles in the back and upper extremities. Mean PPT data for gender, side, and dominant hand groups were analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity of Fischer's standard method were evaluated. PPT cut-off values for each muscle group were determined using an ROC curve.\n\nRESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for each muscle was very high. The PPT in men was higher than in females, and the PPT in the left side was higher than in the right side for all muscles tested (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in PPT for all muscles between dominant and non-dominant hand groups. Diagnosis of MPS based on Fischer's standard showed relatively high specificity and poor sensitivity.\n\nCONCLUSION: The digital pressure algometer showed high reliability. PPT might be a useful parameter for assessing a treatment's effect, but not for use in diagnosis or even as a screening method.

N2  - Introduction: Although physical inactivity has been associated with numerous chronic musculoskeletal complaints, few studies have examined its associations with spinal structures. Moreover, previously reported associations between physical activity and low back pain are conflicting. This study examined the associations between physical inactivity and intervertebral disc height, paraspinal fat content and low back pain and disability. Methods: Seventy-two community-based volunteers not selected for low back pain underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their lumbosacral spine (L1 to S1) between 2011 and 2012. Physical activity was assessed between 2005 and 2008 by questionnaire, while low back pain and disability were assessed by the Chronic Pain Grade Scale at the time of MRI. Intervertebral disc height and cross-sectional area and fat content of multifidus and erector spinae were assessed from MRI. Results: Lower physical activity levels were associated with a more narrow average intervertebral disc height (β -0.63 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.17 mm to -0.08 mm, P=0.026) after adjusting for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). There were no significant associations between physical activity levels and the cross-sectional area of multifidus or erector spinae. Lower levels of physical activity were associated with an increased risk of high fat content in multifidus (odds ratio (OR) 2.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.7, P=0.04) and high-intensity pain/disability (OR=5.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 16.4, P=0.008) after adjustment for age, gender and BMI. Conclusions: Physical inactivity is associated with narrower intervertebral discs, high fat content of the multifidus and high-intensity low back pain and disability in a dose-dependent manner among community-based adults. Longitudinal studies will help to determine the cause and effect nature of these associations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The lumbar back and hip muscles are important for a normal functioning of the human spine and they are considered to be of etiological significance in chronic nonspecific low back pain (nCLBP). Inactivity and a lower level of physical activity in patients with nCLBP may change muscle characteristics and may be associated with pain and disability. Pressure algometry has been found to be non-invasive, efficient and reliable in the exploration of physio-pathological mechanisms involved in muscle pain syndromes. The subjective characteristic of the pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) cannot be avoided once it is the very objective of the measurement, i.e. the minimum pain perceptible by the person, is a subjective factor. Most studies have revealed gender differences between PPTs, with females showing lower thresholds. OBJECTIVE: to determine whether demographic variables and PPTs, are related pain intensity and a disability in patients with nCLBP. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients with nCLBP were included in the study. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Roland-Morris Questionnaire for Low Back Pain (RM) were used to evaluate the intensity of pain and degree of disability. The PPT was performed from L1 up to S2 dermatomes, at the muscles over the Gluteus medius, minimus and maximus, including a point located at the level of the piriformis, at the Quadratus lumborum, at the Iliopsoas and points of reference located at the level of the L1 up to L5 ligaments. The pain intensity was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and the lumbar function by Roland Morris questionnaire (RM). Multiple linear regression models were used for both the VAS and the RM. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the PPTs measured at either left or right limb. The mean VAS value was 7.3 (± 1.5) and the RM score was 14.2 (± 5.3). The PPT-values showed significant negative correlations to the VAS and the RM. The highest correlation between the mean VAS and PPT-values were found at the level of the Gluteus medius (r = -0.34, p < 0.001), which was the only measurement correlated to the intensity of pain (r2 = 0.11, p < 0.001). The RM was correlated to the BMI, the level of education and the PPT values at the level of the Iliopsoas muscle and the L4-L5 supraspinous ligament. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that most PPT values are correlated to the VAS and the RM. Nevertheless, the variability explained by PPT values and demographic characteristics was low for pain intensity and function.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: The lumbar paraspinal muscles, including the erector spinae and multifidus, play an important role in movement and control of the spine. However, our understanding of their contribution to low back pain and disability is unclear. Systematic reviews have reported conflicting evidence for an association between paraspinal muscle size and low back pain, and a paucity of data examining muscle cross-sectional area (CSA)and low back disability. PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between paraspinal muscle CSA and both low back pain intensity and disability. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: One-year longitudinal cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Participants were selected from the SpineData Registry (Denmark), which enrolls people with low back pain of 2 to 12 months duration without radiculopathy and a satisfactory response to primary intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Current, typical, and worst pain in the prior 2 weeks were assessed by 11-point numeric rating scales and an average pain score was calculated, and disability was measured using the 23-item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. CSA (cm 2 )of the lumbar paraspinal muscles was measured at levels L3–L5 from magnetic resonance images. METHODS: Participants completed the study questionnaires and underwent the lumbar spine magnetic resonance images at baseline and were followed up 12 months later to repeat the questionnaires. Statistical analyses involved multivariable linear regression (cross-sectional analysis)and linear mixed-models (longitudinal analysis)with adjustment for confounders. Multiple imputation was conducted to account for missing data. RESULTS: A total of 962 participants were included and 588 (65.8%)were followed up at 12-months. Multivariable analysis showed that greater paraspinal muscle CSA was associated with lower levels of disability, after adjusting for confounders (right mean CSA: baseline beta −0.16, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.06, p<.01; longitudinal beta −0.11, 95% CI −0.21 to −0.01, p=.03). This was evident at all levels, except L5 which was marginal at baseline (beta −0.08, 95% CI −0.15 to −0.001, p=.045)and not significant longitudinally (beta −0.05, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.02, p=.18). However, there were no associations between muscle CSA and pain intensity (baseline beta −0.02, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.02, p=.29; longitudinal beta −0.02, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.02, p=.34). Results were similar for both complete case and multiple imputation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study found an inverse relationship between lumbar paraspinal muscle CSA and low back disability, but not pain intensity. While further investigation is needed, these findings suggest that treatment strategies directed at increasing paraspinal muscle size may be effective in reducing low back disability.

N2  - Background Context: Low back pain and disability are major public health problems and may be related to paraspinal muscle abnormalities, such as a reduction in muscle size and muscle fat content. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the associations between paraspinal muscle size and fat content with lumbar spine symptoms and structure. Study Design/Setting: This was a community-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cohort study. Patient Sample: A total of 72 adults not selected on the basis of low back pain were included in the study. Outcome Measures: The outcomes measured were lumbar modic change and intervertebral disc height. Pain intensity and disability were measured from the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire at the time of MRI. Methods: The cross-sectional area (CSA) and amount of fat in multifidus and erector spinae (high percentage defined by >50% of muscle) were measured, and their association with outcome was assessed. Results: Muscle CSA was not associated with low back pain/disability or structure. High percentage of fat in multifidus was associated with an increased risk of high-intensity pain/disability (odds ratio [OR], 12.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-78.3; p=.007) and modic change (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.1-17.3; p=.04). High fat replacement of erector spinae was associated with reduced intervertebral disc height (β=-0.9 mm; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.3; p=.002) and modic change (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.1-21.9; p=.04). Conclusions: Paraspinal fat infiltration, but not muscle CSA, was associated with high-intensity pain/disability and structural abnormalities in the lumbar spine. Although cause and effect cannot be determined from this cross-sectional study, longitudinal data will help to determine whether disabling low back pain and structural abnormalities of the spine are a cause or result of fat replacement of paraspinal muscles.

N2  - Background Muscle stiffness of the lumbar back muscles in low back pain (LBP) patients has not been clearly elucidated because quantitative assessment of the stiffness of individual muscles was conventionally difficult. This study aimed to examine the association of LBP with muscle stiffness assessed using ultrasonic shear wave elastography (SWE) and muscle mass of the lumbar back muscle, and spinal alignment in young and middle-aged medical workers. Methods The study comprised 23 asymptomatic medical workers [control (CTR) group] and 9 medical workers with LBP (LBP group). Muscle stiffness and mass of the lumbar back muscles (lumbar erector spinae, multifidus, and quadratus lumborum) in the prone position were measured using ultrasonic SWE. Sagittal spinal alignment in the standing and prone positions was measured using a Spinal Mouse. The association with LBP was investigated by multiple logistic regression analysis with a forward selection method. The analysis was conducted using the shear elastic modulus and muscle thickness of the lumbar back muscles, and spinal alignment, age, body height, body weight, and sex as independent variables. Findings Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that muscle stiffness of the lumbar multifidus muscle and body height were significant and independent determinants of LBP, but that muscle mass and spinal alignment were not. Muscle stiffness of the lumbar multifidus muscle in the LBP group was significantly higher than that in the CTR group. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that LBP is associated with muscle stiffness of the lumbar multifidus muscle in young and middle-aged medical workers.

N2  - Background Context Although previous studies have investigated the association between paraspinal muscle morphology and low back pain (LBP), the results are conflicting. Purpose This systematic review examined the relationship between size and composition of the paraspinal muscles and LBP. Study Design/Setting A systematic review was carried out. Patient Sample No patient sample was required. Outcome Measures This review had no outcome measures. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify studies investigating the association between the cross-sectional area or fatty infiltration of the paraspinal muscles (erector spinae, multifidus, psoas, and quadratus lumborum) and LBP. Descriptive data regarding study design and methodology were tabulated and a risk of bias assessment was performed. Results Of the 119 studies identified, 25 met the inclusion criteria. Eight studies were reported as having low to moderate risk of bias. There was evidence for a negative association between cross-sectional area (CSA) of multifidus and LBP, but conflicting evidence for a relationship between erector spinae, psoas, and quadratus lumborum CSA and LBP. Moreover, there was evidence to indicate multifidus CSA was predictive of LBP for up to 12 months in men, but insufficient evidence to indicate a relationship for longer time periods. Although there was conflicting evidence for a relationship between multifidus fat infiltration and LBP, there was no or limited evidence for an association for the other paraspinal musculature. Conclusions This review found evidence that multifidus CSA was negatively associated with and predictive of LBP up to 12 months but conflicting evidence for an association between erector spinae, psoas, and quadratus lumborum CSA and LBP. To further understand the role of the paraspinal musculature in LBP, there is a need for high-quality cohort studies which extend over both the short and longer term.

N2  - Objectives Characteristics of muscle activity, represented by surface electromyography (EMG), have revealed differences between patients with low back pain (LBP) and healthy adults; how they relate to functional and clinical parameters remains unclear. The purpose of the current study was to examine the correlation between frequency characteristics of EMG (analysed using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) analysis) and patients' self-rated score of disability. Design and setting This is a case-control study with 15 patients with mechanical LBP without radicular symptoms. Patients were recruited from the orthopaedic clinic at Charing Cross Hospital. Ten healthy adults were recruited from the staff working in the hospital and associated university. Patients completed the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and bilateral EMG activity was obtained from erector spinae at vertebral levels L4 and T12. Subjects performed three brief maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) of the back extensors and the torque was measured using a dynamometer. CWT was applied to the EMG signals of each muscle in a 200 ms window centred around the peak torque obtained during the MVICs. The ratio (low/high frequencies) of the energy, the peak power and the frequency of the peak power were calculated for each recording site, averaged and correlated with the individual's RMDQ score. Results Patients had lower peak power (T12 and L4) and lower frequency of the peak power (at T12) than the healthy adults. Additionally, RMDQ positively correlated to the average ratio of energy at T12 (r=0.63; p=0.012), that is, greater self-rated disability corresponded to a dominant distribution of energy in the lower frequencies. Conclusion The current findings reveal alterations in EMG profile and its association with self-related back pain disability, suggesting that spectral characteristics of EMG reflect muscle function.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the relationship between the cross sectional area (CSA) and isokinetic strength of the back muscles in patients with chronic low back pain. Method: Data of twenty-eight middle-aged patients with chronic back pain were analyzed retrospectively. CSAs of both paraspinal muscles and the disc at the L4-L5 level were measured in MRI axial images and the relative CSAs (rCSA: CSA ratio of muscle and disc) were calculated. Th e degree of paraspinal muscle atrophy was rated qualitatively. Isokinetic strengths (peak torque, peak torque per body weight) of back flexor and extensor were measured with the isokinetic testing machine. Multiple regression analysis with backward elimination was used to evaluate relations between isokinetic strength and various factors, such as CSA or rCSA and clinical characteristics in all patients. Th e same analysis was repeated in the female patients. Results: In analysis with CSA and clinical characteristics, body mass index (BMI) and CSA were significant influencing factors in the peak torque of the back flexor muscles. CSA was a significant influencing factor in the peak torque of total back muscles. In analysis with rCSA and clinical characteristics, BMI was signifi cant in infl uencing the peak torque of the back flexors. In female patients, rCSA was a signifi cant infl uencing factor in the peak torque per body weight of the back flexors, and age and BMI were infl uencing factors in the peak torque of back fl exors and total back muscles. Conclusion: In middle-aged patients with chronic low back pain, CSA and rCSA were infl uencing factors in the strength of total back muscles and back fl exors. Also, gender and BMI were influencing factors. © 2012 by Korean Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine.

N2  - Only a few previous studies have investigated paraspinal musculature (i.e., multifidus (MF), psoas major (PSM), erector spinae (ES)) in longitudinal, population-based settings. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the paraspinal muscles between the ages of 20 and 30 years. The study population consisted of a sub-cohort from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (n = 298; 156 men, 142 women). Baseline magnetic resonance imaging was performed at a mean age of 21.3 years and follow-up imaging at 30.6 years. The CSA measurements were performed by tracing the paraspinal muscle outlines individually (MF, ES, PM) and all combined (total muscle area (TMA)) at the L4 cranial endplate level. The longitudinal data analysis was performed using generalized estimating equations modelling. The CSA of MF and ES increased during the follow-up among both sexes (men: MF + 5.7%, p < 0.001; ES + 2.7%, p = 0.001; and women: MF + 10.5%, p < 0.001; ES 9.2%, p = 0.001). The CSA of PM decreased among men (PM −4.0%, p < 0.001) but not among women (PM + 0.5%, p = 0.553). TMA increased significantly only among women (men: +0.5%, p = 0.425; women: +6.5%, p < 0.001). The increases in ES and TMA were more distinct among women than men (p < 0.001). Our study demonstrated clear age- and sex-related changes in paraspinal muscle size in early adulthood.

N2  - Purpose: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a disabling condition associated with narrowing of the spinal canal or vertebral foramina. Paraspinal muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration have been reported in patients with chronic LBP and disc herniation. However, very few imaging studies have examined paraspinal muscle morphology and composition in patients with LSS. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of paraspinal muscle size, composition and asymmetry with functional status in patients with LSS. Methods: Thirty-six patients diagnosed with LSS at L4–L5 with neurogenic claudication were included. Paraspinal muscle measurements were obtained from axial T2-weighted MR images, bilaterally, at the level of the superior and inferior vertebral endplates of L5. Muscle measurements of interest included: total cross-sectional area (CSA), functional CSA (FCSA), the ratio of FCSA to CSA (FCSA/CSA) as an indicator of muscle composition, and relative % asymmetry in muscle CSA. The association between muscle parameters and other patient characteristics with function as indicated from Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores and pain interference status was investigated. Results: Greater multifidus muscle fatty infiltration (e.g., lower FCSA/CSA) and lower psoas relative CSA were associated with lower function (higher ODI and pain interference scores) in univariable and multivariable analyses. There was no association between the different muscle parameters and stenosis severity or back or leg pain duration or severity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest an association of multifidus muscle fatty infiltration and psoas muscle size with functional status in patients diagnosed with LSS. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether such muscle parameters are associated with prognosis and functional recovery following surgical treatment.

N2  - Background Context Heterogeneity exists within the low back pain (LBP) population. Some patients recover after every pain episode, whereas others suffer daily from LBP complaints. Until now, studies rarely make a distinction between recurrent low back pain (RLBP) and chronic low back pain (CLBP), although both are characterized by a different clinical picture. Clinical experiences also indicate that heterogeneity exists within the CLBP population. Muscle degeneration, like atrophy, fat infiltration, alterations in muscle fiber type, and altered muscle activity, compromises proper biomechanics and motion of the spinal units in LBP patients. The amount of alterations in muscle structure and muscle function of the paraspinal muscles might be related to the recurrence or chronicity of LBP. Purpose The aim of this experimental study is to evaluate differences in muscle structure (cross-sectional area and lean muscle fat index) and muscle activity of the multifidus (MF) and erector spinae (ES) during trunk extension, in patients with RLBP, non-continuous CLBP, and continuous CLBP. Study Design and Setting This cross-sectional study took place in the university hospital of Ghent, Belgium. Muscle structure characteristics and muscle activity were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patient Sample Fifty-five adults with non-specific LBP (24 RLBP in remission, 15 non-continuous CLBP, 16 continuous CLBP) participated in this study. Outcome Measures Total cross-sectional area, muscle cross-sectional area, fat cross-sectional area, lean muscle fat index, T2-rest and T2-shift were assessed. Methods A T1-weighted Dixon MRI scan was used to evaluate spinal muscle cross-sectional area and fat infiltration in the lumbar MF and ES. Muscle functional MRI was used to evaluate the muscle activity of the lumbar MF and ES during a lumbar extension exercise. Before and after the exercise, a pain assessment was performed. This study was supported by grants from the Special Research Fund of Ghent University (DEF12/AOP/022) without potential conflict of interest-associated biases in the text of the paper. Results Fat cross-sectional area and lean muscle fat index were significantly higher in MF and ES in continuous CLBP compared with non-continuous CLBP and RLBP (p<.05). No differencesbetween groups were found for total cross-sectional area and muscle cross-sectional area in MF or ES (p>.05). Also, no significant differences between groups for T2-rest were established. T2-shift, however, was significantly lower in MF and ES in RLBP compared with, respectively, non-continuous CLBP and continuous CLBP (p<.05). Conclusions These results indicate a higher amount of fat infiltration in the lumbar muscles, in the absence of clear atrophy, in continuous CLBP compared with RLBP. A lower metabolic activity of the lumbar muscles was seen in RLBP replicating a relative lower intensity in contractions performed by the lumbar muscles in RLBP compared with non-continuous and continuous CLBP. In conclusion, RLBP differs from continuous CLBP for both muscle structure and muscle function, whereas non-continuous CLBP seems comparable with RLBP for lumbar muscle structure and with continuous CLBP for lumbar muscle function. These results underline the differences in muscle structure and muscle function between different LBP populations.

N2  - Anatomy of the muscle-tendon system is an important component to musculoskeletal models. In particular, the cross-sectional area of belly (mCSA) and tendon (tCSA) provides information about the maximum force that a muscle may exert. The ratio of mCSA to tCSA (rCSA) demonstrates how muscle force is related to the ability to resist/transmit the force to bone. Previous anatomical studies of the lumbar paraspinal muscles (LPM) showed that their bellies have large mCSA suggesting that they are powerful muscles. Surprisingly, surgical experience shows that the tendons of the LPM are among the thinnest tendons of the body. We therefore hypothesized that traditional biomechanics of the LPM and the rCSA do not correspond for LPM. In 10 fresh-frozen old cadavers, we measured the mCSA, tCSA and rCSA of the LPM (multifidus and the erector spinae, i.e. the longissimus and the iliocostalis); then, we compared these data with those of one of the weakest muscles in the body, i.e. the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) chosen because it shares some common anatomical features with the LPM, in particular with the erector spinae. For instance, the EDC has a polyarticular course and presents long and thin effector tendons. Among the LPM, the longissimus has the greatest mean ACSA with 10.42 cm2 compared with 9.16 cm 2 for the iliocostalis and 0.24 cm 2 for the multifidus. Mean ACSA of the EDC was almost ten times smaller than those of erector spinae. Regarding the mean tCSA, the EDC was the largest one with 11.48 mm 2 compared with 2.69 mm 2 and 1.43 mm 2 for the longissimus, 5.74 mm 2 and 2.38 mm 2 for the iliocostalis and 5.28 mm 2 and 4.96 mm 2 for the multifidus. Mean rCSAs of the erector spinae were extremely small, ranged from 1/156 for the spinal attachment of the iliocostalis to 1/739 for the rib attachment of the longissimus that suggests that tendons are an unsuitable size to transmit the force to bone. Mean rCSA of the multifidus and the EDC were in the same range with rCSA = 1/5 and rCSA = 1/9 respectively. The rCSA of the multifidus was substantial, but its ACSA (1cm 2 ) corresponds to low-power muscles. This paradoxical anatomy compels us to consider the biomechanics of the LPM in a different way from that of the classical "chord-like model", i.e. the muscle belly creates a force that is applied to a bone piece through a tendon. The LPM have large contractile mass in a semirigid compartment inside which the pressure may increase. This result strengthens the hypothesis that high pressure and intrinsic stiffness of the LPM create two stiff bodies, closely attached to the spine thus ensuring its stabilization.

N2  - Background: In order for measurements to be clinically useful, data on psychometric conditions such as reliability should be available in the population for which the measurements are intended to be used. This study comprises a test-retest design separated by 7 to 14 days, and evaluates the intra and interrater reliability of regional frontal and horizontal spinal motion in 219 chronic LBP patients using the CA6000 Spine Motion Analyzer. In addition, it compares these results on the frontal and horizontal plane with previously published results on the sagittal plane. 219 individuals with chronic mechanical LBP, classified as either Quebec Task Force group 1, 2, 3 or 4 were included, and kinematics of the lumbar spine were sampled during standardized spinal lateral flexion and rotation motion using a 6-df instrumented spatial linkage system. Test-retest reliability and measurement error were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients ICC(1,1) and Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOAs). Results: The reliability analysis based on the whole study sample showed ICC(1,1) coefficients varying between 0.68 and 0.73 for the frontal plane and 0.33 and 0.49 for the horizontal plane. Relatively wide LOAs were observed for all parameters. Reliability measures in patient subgroups ICC(1,1) ranged between 0.55 and 0.81 for the frontal plane and 0.28 and 0.69 for the horizontal plane. Greater ICC(1,1) coefficients and smaller LOA were observed when patients were examined by the same examiner, had a stable pain level between tests, and were male. ROM measurements were more reliable in patients with a BMI higher than 30, and measurements on patients with LBP and leg pain showed higher reliability and smaller measurement error in all parameters except for the jerk index. Conclusion: Frontal plane measurements obtained using the CA6000 Spine Motion Analyzer are sufficiently reliable to be used for group comparisons but not individual comparisons. Measurements in the horizontal plane can be used for neither group nor individual comparisons.

N2  - The lumbar paraspinal muscle compartment (PMC) is a stabilizing system of the spine whose efficiency depends on its elastic properties, which may be quantifiable by supersonic shear wave elastography (SWE). The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) encapsulates the lumbar paraspinal muscles (LPM) and creates a PMC. Tensioning of the TLF via the stretching of the latissimus dorsi is supposed to increase stiffness within the PMC. The aims of this study were (1) to test the reliability of SWE in the multifidus and the erector spinae (ES) in prone and sited position; (2) to investigate the role of the tensioning of the pTLF, via stretching of the latissimus dorsi (LD), on LPM stiffness. Stiffness of ES and multifidus was measured using SWE at L3–L4 in procubitus and seated position in 15 participants. Stretching of LD was performed with arm elevation. Parametric paired tests, multiple analyses of variance, and intraclass correlation were used for statistical analysis. Reliability estimates were fair to excellent. Reliability was greater in ES than the multifidus, greater in seated position than during rest. Stiffness was greater in the ES than in multifidus, and in seated position than at rest. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not generate significant LPM stiffness changes. SWE is a reliable tool for assessing stiffness in the LPM. Reliability of SWE protocols is improved during seated position. Tensioning of the TLF via LD stretching did not influence LPM stiffness. Clin. Anat. 32:73–80, 2019. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Motor control, which relies on constant communication between motor and sensory systems, is crucial for spine posture, stability and movement. Adaptions of motor control occur in low back pain (LBP) while different motor adaption strategies exist across individuals, probably to reduce LBP and risk of injury. However, in some individuals with LBP, adapted motor control strategies might have long-term consequences, such as increased spinal loading that has been linked with degeneration of intervertebral discs and other tissues, potentially maintaining recurrent or chronic LBP. Factors contributing to motor control adaptations in LBP have been extensively studied on the motor output side, but less attention has been paid to changes in sensory input, specifically proprioception. Furthermore, motor cortex reorganization has been linked with chronic and recurrent LBP, but underlying factors are poorly understood. Here, we review current research on behavioral and neural effects of motor control adaptions in LBP. We conclude that back pain-induced disrupted or reduced proprioceptive signaling likely plays a pivotal role in driving long-term changes in the top-down control of the motor system via motor and sensory cortical reorganization. In the outlook of this review, we explore whether motor control adaptations are also important for other (musculoskeletal) pain conditions.

N2  - The aims of the study were to evaluate the relative and absolute variability of upper (T11-L2) and lower (L2-S2) lumbar spinal alignment in power- and weightlifters during the deadlift and back squat exercises, and to compare this alignment between the two lifting groups. Twenty-four competitive powerlifters (n = 14) and weightlifters (n = 10) performed three repetitions of the deadlift and the back squat exercises using a load equivalent to 70% of their respective one-repetition maximum. The main outcome measures were the three-dimensional lumbar spinal alignment for start position, minimum and maximum angle of their spinal alignment, and range of motion measured using inertial measurement units. Relative intra-trial reliability was calculated using the two-way random model intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and absolute reliability with minimal detectable change (MDC). The ICC ranged between 0.69 and 0.99 and the MDC between 1°-8° for the deadlift. Corresponding figures for the squat were 0.78–0.99 and 1°-6°. In all participants during both exercises, spinal adjustments were made in both thoracolumbar and lumbopelvic areas in all three dimensions. In conclusion, when performing three repetitions of the deadlift and the squat, lumbar spinal alignment of the lifters did not change much between repetitions and did not differ significantly between power- and weightlifters.

N2  - Molecular events that drive disc damage and low back pain (LBP) may precede clinical manifestation of disease onset and can cause detrimental long-term effects such as disability. Biomarkers serve as objective molecular indicators of pathological processes. The goal of this study is to identify systemic biochemical factors as predictors of response to treatment of LBP with epidural steroid injection (ESI). Since inflammation plays a pivotal role in LBP, this pilot study investigates the effect of ESI on systemic levels of 48 inflammatory biochemical factors (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) and examines the relationship between biochemical factor levels and pain or disability in patients with disc herniation (DH), or other diagnoses (Other Dx) leading to low back pain, which included spinal stenosis (SS) and degenerative disc disease (DDD). Study participants (n = 16) were recruited from a back pain management practice. Pain numerical rating score (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and blood samples were collected pre- and at 7 to 10 days post-treatment. Blood samples were assayed for inflammatory mediators using commercial multiplex assays. Mediator levels were compared pre- and post-treatment to investigate the potential correlations between clinical and biochemical outcomes. Our results indicate that a single ESI significantly decreased systemic levels of SCGF-β and IL-2. Improvement in pain in all subjects was correlated with changes in chemokines (MCP-1, MIG), hematopoietic progenitor factors (SCGF-β), and factors that participate in angiogenesis/fibrosis (HGF), nociception (SCF, IFN-α2), and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TRAIL). Levels of biochemical mediators varied based on diagnosis of LBP, and changes in pain responses and systemic mediators from pre- to post-treatment were dependent on the diagnosis cohort. In the DH cohort, levels of IL-17 and VEGF significantly decreased post-treatment. In the Other Dx cohort, levels of IL-2Rα, IL-3, and SCGF-β significantly decreased post-treatment. In order to determine whether mediator changes were related to pain, correlations between change in pain scores and change in mediator levels were performed. Subjects with DH demonstrated a profile signature that implicated hematopoiesis factors (SCGF-β, GM-CSF) in pain response, while subjects with Other Dx demonstrated a biomarker profile that implicated chemokines (MCP-1, MIG) and angiogenic factors (HGF, VEGF) in pain response. Our findings provide evidence that systemic biochemical factors in patients with LBP vary by diagnosis, and pain response to treatment is associated with a unique profile of biochemical responses in each diagnosis group. Future hypothesis-based studies with larger subject cohorts are warranted to confirm the findings of this pilot exploratory study.

N2  - We aimed to compare serum biomarkers of inflammation, redox status and cartilage degradation between chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients with and without Modic 1 changes. We used a convenience sample of patients recruited from a single center, case-control study, conducted in a tertiary care center. From December, 2014 to May, 2016, 2,292 patients were consecutively screened, 34 met inclusion criteria and were prospectively enrolled in the present study. Cases (n = 13) were defined as patients with Modic 1 changes detected on MRI and controls (n = 21) as cLBP patients without (Modic 0). To assess serum biomarkers of inflammation, redox status and cartilage degradation, fasting serum samples were collected in a standardized manner and analyzed by immunoassays and spectrophotometry. Mean (95% CI) age was 44.1 (40.0–48.1) years and mean LBP duration was 72.5 (53.0–91.9) months. Serum biomarkers of inflammation (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α), redox status (total thiols, advanced oxidation protein products and carbonyl groups) and cartilage degradation (Coll2-1 and Coll2-1NO2) did not differ between cLBP patients with and without Modic 1 changes. In summary, we did not find any differences in serum biomarkers between cLBP patients with and without Modic 1 changes. Interpretation is limited by convenience sampling and small sample size.

N2  - Background:The pathogenesis of low back pain (LBP) remains unclear. However, recent studies suggest that the inflammatory response may be inherent in spinal pain. The purpose of this study was to discern inflammatory profiles in patients with nonspecific acute and chronic LBP in relation to those in asymptomatic individuals.Materials and Methods:Peripheral blood samples were obtained from asymptomatic controls and patients with nonspecific acute and chronic LBP reporting a minimum pain score of 3 on a 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The levels of in vitro production of proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα], interleukin [IL] 1β, IL-6, IL-2, interferon γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1 receptor antagonist, soluble receptors of TNF2, and IL-10) mediators were determined by specific immunoassays.Results:The mean VAS scores were comparable between the acute and chronic LBP patient groups. Compared with asymptomatic group, the production of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and their ratios to IL-10 levels were significantly elevated in both patient groups (P=0.0001 to 0.003). In acute LBP group, the ratio of IL-2:IL-10 was also significantly increased (P=0.02). In contrast, the production of interferon γ was significantly reduced compared with the other study groups (P=0.005 to 0.01), nevertheless, it was positively correlated (P=0.006) with pain scores. In chronic LBP patients, the production of TNFα, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and soluble receptors of TNF2 was significantly increased (P=0.001 to 0.03) in comparison with the control and acute LBP groups, and TNFα and IL-1β levels were positively correlated (P<0.001) with VAS scores.Conclusions:The inflammatory profiles of patients with acute and chronic LBP are distinct. Nonetheless, in both patient groups, an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediator levels favors the production of proinflammatory components.

N2  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: About 85% of the patients with low back pain seeking medical care have nonspecific low back pain (NsLBP), implying that no definitive cause can be identified. Nonspecific low back pain is defined as low back pain and disability which cannot be linked to an underlying pathology, such as cancer, spinal osteomyelitis, fracture, spinal stenosis, cauda equine, ankylosing spondylitis, and visceral-referred pain. Many pain conditions are linked with elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers. Outcomes of interest are NsLBP and the level of pro-inflammatory biomarkers. PURPOSE: To unravel the etiology and get better insight in the prognosis of NsLBP, the aim of this study was to assess the association between pro-inflammatory biomarkers and the presence and severity of NsLBP. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature search was made in Embase, Medline, Cinahl, Webof-science, and Google scholar up to January 19th 2017. METHODS: Included were cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting on patients aged over 18 years with NsLBP, in which one or more pro-inflammatory biomarkers were measured in blood plasma. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. A best-evidence synthesis was used to summarize the results from the individual studies, meaning that the included studies were ranked according to the consistency of the findings and according to their methodological quality score using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Included were 10 studies which assessed four different pro-inflammatory biomarkers. For the association between the presence of NsLBP and C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α limited, conflicting and moderate evidence, respectively, was found. For the association between the severity of NsLBP and CRP and IL-6, moderate evidence was found. For the association between the severity of NsLBP and TNF-α and RANTES Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted conflicting and limited evidence, respectively, was found. CONCLUSIONS: This study found moderate evidence for (i) a positive association between the pro-inflammatory biomarkers CRP and IL-6 and the severity of NsLBP, and (ii) a positive association between TNF-α and the presence of NsLBP. Conflicting and limited evidence was found for the association between TNF-α and Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted and severity of NsLBP, respectively.

N2  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The true understanding of aging and disc degeneration (DD) is still elusive. MRI has not helped our attempts to understand the health and disease status of the discs as it reflects mainly the end morphologic changes and not the changes at a molecular level. Understanding degeneration at a molecular level through proteomics might allow differentiation from normal aging and also aid in the development of biomarkers for early diagnosis and preventive therapies. PURPOSE: To utilize proteomics to understand the molecular basis of healthy, aging, and degenerating discs and conclusively differentiate normal aging and degeneration. STUDY DESIGN: Proteomic analysis of human intervertebral disc samples. METHODS: L4–L5 disc samples from three groups were acquired and subjected to proteomic analysis. Samples from individuals aged in the second, third, and fourth decades were used to represent young healthy discs (Group A). Those from MRI normal donors aged in the fifth, sixth, and seventh decades represented normal aging (Group B). Five degenerated discs obtained from patients at surgery represented degeneration (Group C). The entire proteome map and alteration in protein expressions were further analyzed using bioinformatics analysis. This was a self-funded project. RESULTS: There were 84 common proteins. Specific proteins numbered 225 in A, 315 in B, and 283 in C. By gene ontology biological process identification, Group A predominated with extracellular matrix organization, cytoskeletal structural and normal metabolic proteins. Group B differed in having additional basal expression of immune response, complement inhibitors, and senescence proteins. Group C was different, with upregulation of proteins associated with oxidative stress response, positive regulators of apoptosis, innate immune response, complement activation and defense response to gram positive bacteria indicating ongoing inflammaging. CONCLUSIONS: Our study documented diverse proteome signatures between the young, aging and degenerating discs. Inflammaging was the main differentiator between normal biological aging and DD. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Multiple inflammatory molecules unique to DD were identified, allowing the possibility of developing specific biomarkers for early diagnosis and thereby provide evidence-based metrics for preventive measures rather than surgical intervention and also to monitor progress of the disease.

N2  - Purpose: Low back pain (LBP) is the most disabling condition worldwide. Although LBP relates to different spinal pathologies, vertebral bone marrow lesions visualized as Modic changes on MRI have a high specificity for discogenic LBP. This review summarizes the pathobiology of Modic changes and suggests a disease model. Methods: Non-systematic literature review. Results: Chemical and mechanical stimulation of nociceptors adjacent to damaged endplates are likely a source of pain. Modic changes are adjacent to a degenerated intervertebral disc and have three generally interconvertible types suggesting that the different Modic change types represent different stages of the same pathological process, which is characterized by inflammation, high bone turnover, and fibrosis. A disease model is suggested where disc/endplate damage and the persistence of an inflammatory stimulus (i.e., occult discitis or autoimmune response against disc material) create predisposing conditions. The risk to develop Modic changes likely depends on the inflammatory potential of the disc and the capacity of the bone marrow to respond to it. Bone marrow lesions in osteoarthritic knee joints share many characteristics with Modic changes adjacent to degenerated discs and suggest that damage-associated molecular patterns and marrow fat metabolism are important pathogenetic factors. There is no consensus on the ideal therapy. Non-surgical treatment approaches including intradiscal steroid injections, anti-TNF-α antibody, antibiotics, and bisphosphonates have some demonstrated efficacy in mostly non-replicated clinical studies in reducing Modic changes in the short term, but with unknown long-term benefits. New diagnostic tools and animal models are required to improve painful Modic change identification and classification, and to clarify the pathogenesis. Conclusion: Modic changes are likely to be more than just a coincidental imaging finding in LBP patients and rather represent an underlying pathology that should be a target for therapy.

N2  - Background: There is increasing interest in the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of sciatica and whether these could be potential targets for treatment. We sought to investigate serum biomarker levels in patients with low back-related leg pain, including sciatica. Methods: Primary care consulters aged > 18 with low back-related leg pain were recruited to a cohort study (ATLAS). Participants underwent a standardised clinical assessment, lumbar spine MRI and a subsample (n = 119) had samples taken for biomarker analysis. Participants were classified having: a) clinically confirmed sciatica or referred leg pain, and then subdivided into those with (or without) MRI confirmed nerve root compression due to disc prolapse. Seventeen key cytokines, chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) implicated in sciatica pathogenesis including TNFα and IL-6, were assayed in duplicate using commercial multiplex detection kits and measured using a Luminex suspension array system. Median biomarker levels were compared between the groups using a Mann Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between clinical measures and biomarker levels adjusted for possible confounders such as age, sex, and symptom duration. Results: No difference was found in the serum level of any of the 17 biomarkers tested in patients with (n = 93) or without (n = 26) clinically confirmed sciatica, nor between those with (n = 44) or without (n = 49) sciatica and MRI confirmed nerve root compression. Conclusion: In this cohort, no significant differences in serum levels of TNFα, IL-6 or any other biomarkers were seen between patients with sciatica and those with back pain with referred leg pain. These results suggest that in patients with low back-related leg pain, serum markers associated with inflammation do not discriminate between patients with or without clinically confirmed sciatica or between those with or without evidence of nerve root compression on MRI.

N2  - Low back pain (LBP) is the world's most disabling condition. Modic changes (MC) are vertebral bone marrow changes adjacent to the endplates as noted on magnetic resonance imaging. The associations of specific MC types and patterns with prolonged, severe LBP and disability remain speculative. This study assessed the relationship of prolonged, severe LBP and back-related disability, with the presence and morphology of lumbar MC in a large cross-sectional population-based study of Southern Chinese. We addressed the topographical and morphological dimensions of MC along with other magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes (eg, disc degeneration and displacement) on the basis of axial T1 and sagittal T2-weighted imaging of L1-S1. Prolonged severe LBP was defined as LBP lasting ≥30 days during the past year, and a visual analog scale severest pain intensity of at least 6/10. An Oswestry Disability Index score of 15% was regarded as significant disability. We also assessed subject demographics, occupation, and lifestyle factors. In total, 1142 subjects (63% females, mean age 53 years) were assessed. Of these, 282 (24.7%) had MC (7.1% type I, 17.6% type II). MC subjects were older (P=0.003), had more frequent disc displacements (P<0.001) and greater degree of disc degeneration (P<0.001) than non-MC subjects. In adjusted models, any MC (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.18), MC affecting whole anterior-posterior length (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.04-2.51), and MC affecting 2/3 posterior length (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.17-6.65) were associated with prolonged severe LBP. Type I MC tended to associate with pain more strongly than type II MC (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.94-3.44 vs OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.88-2.09, respectively). Any MC (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04-2.10), type II MC (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06-2.31), MC affecting 2/3 posterior length (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.27-6.89), and extensive MC (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.21-3.15) were associated with disability. The strength of the associations increased with the number of MC. This large-scale study is the first to definitively note MC types and specific morphologies to be independently associated with prolonged severe LBP and back-related disability. This proposed refined MC phenotype may have direct implications in clinical decision-making as to the development and management of LBP. Understanding of these imaging biomarkers can lead to new preventative and personalized therapeutics related to LBP.

N2  - Background Context Modic changes (MC) are bone marrow lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggestive of being associated with low back pain (LBP). Data on determinants of MC and their association with disc degeneration and other spinal phenotypes, as well as that of LBP, rely mostly on small-scale patient populations and remain controversial. Purpose This study addressed the potential determinants of MC and their association with disc degeneration and LBP among Southern Chinese. Study Design/Setting A cross-sectional, population-based study was carried out. Patient Sample This study consisted of 2,449 Southern Chinese volunteers. Methods Sagittal T2-weighted MRIs of the lumbar spine were assessed for the presence of MC and other spinal phenotypes (eg, disc degeneration, disc displacement, Schmorl nodes) in all individuals. Subjects' demographics, occupation, lifestyle, and clinical profiles were assessed. Results The overall prevalence of MC was 5.8% (n=141), which increased with advancing age. Modic changes predominantly occurred at the lowest two lumbar levels (83%). In the multivariate analyses, only the presence of disc displacement and a higher disc degeneration score were associated with MC at the upper lumbar levels (L1/L2-L3/L4) (p<.01). The presence of MC at the lowest two lumbar levels (L4/L5-L5/S1) were associated with age, the presence of Schmorl nodes, disc degeneration or displacement, and historical lumbar injury (p<.01). Subjects who were both smokers and overweight or obese had increased likelihood of MC in the lower spine (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.10-4.30). The presence of MC at the lower lumbar levels were associated with historical LBP (OR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.05-3.54) and with severity and duration of symptoms (p<.05). Conclusions Based on one of the largest MRI studies to assess lumbar MC, we noted that MC were associated with both disc degeneration and the presence and severity of LBP. Determinants and association of MC with disc degeneration and clinical symptoms in the upper versus the lower lumbar spine were different. Our study further stresses the significance of MC as important imaging phenotypes associated with LBP.

N2  - Study Design. Prospective case series. Objective. Evaluate lumbar paraspinal muscle (PSM) crosssectional area and intervertebral disc (IVD) height changes induced by a 6-month space mission on the International Space Station. The long-term objective of this project is to promote spine health and prevent spinal injury during space missions and here on Earth. Summary of Background Data. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) crewmembers have a 4.3 times higher risk of herniated IVDs, compared with the general and military aviator populations. The highest risk occurs during the first year after a mission. Microgravity exposure during longduration spaceflights results in approximately 5 cm lengthening of body height, spinal pain, and skeletal deconditioning. How the PSMs and IVDs respond during spaceflight is not well described. Methods. Six NASA crewmembers were imaged supine with a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Imaging was conducted preflight, immediately postflight, and then 33 to 67 days after landing. Functional cross-sectional area (FCSA) measurements of the PSMs were performed at the L3-4 level. FCSA was measured by grayscale thresholding within the posterior lumbar extensors to isolate lean muscle on T2-weighted scans. IVD heights were measured at the anterior, middle, and posterior sections of all lumbar levels. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine significance at P<0.05, followed by post-hoc testing. Results. Paraspinal lean muscle mass, as indicated by the FCSA, decreased from 86% of the total PSM cross-sectional area down to 72%, immediately after the mission. Recovery of 68% of the postflight loss occurred during the next 6 weeks, still leaving a significantly lower lean muscle fractional content compared with preflight values. In contrast, lumbar IVD heights were not appreciably different at any time point. Conclusion. The data reveal lumbar spine PSM atrophy after long-duration spaceflight. Some FCSA recovery was seen with 46 days postflight in a terrestrial environment, but it remained incomplete compared with preflight levels.

N2  - Purpose: To clarify the significance of Modic changes, bony endplate lesions, and disc degeneration as predictors of chronic low back pain (LBP) during 1-year follow-up. Methods: 49 patients with severe, non-specific, chronic LBP, and Modic 1 lesion (M1) were prospectively studied with MRI and questionnaire. Changes in grade of disc degeneration, severity of Modic changes, Schmorl lesions, and bony endplate irregularities were evaluated and changes assessed in LBP intensity on numeric rating scale 0–10 and severity with Oswestry disability index 0–100 (ODI). Association between change in MRI findings and symptoms was computed using generalized estimating equations analysis. Results: Although pain decreased in most patients during 1-year follow-up, it increased or persisted in 36 %. Change in M1, M2, bony endplate lesions, and signal intensity (SI) and height of the disc associated with change of pain intensity, while change in M1, bony endplate lesions, and disc height associated with change of ODI. Not only persistent M1s, increasing bony endplate lesions, decreasing disc height, and M2s, but also new M2s predicted persistence of pain, while decrease of M1s and SI of the disc and increase of size of M2s predicted decrease of pain. Changes in disc bulges did not associate with pain. Conclusions: In patients with chronic non-specific LBP, persisting M1, decreasing disc height, and increasing bony endplate lesions associated with persisting pain while decrease of SI of the disc with decrease of pain. Such changing MRI findings in the same disc space have earlier been shown to progress abnormally fast. They may be signs or biomarkers of a prolonged pain causing, deforming degenerative process, and should lead to considering early intervention or specific treatments to affect that process.

N2  - Spinal elongation and back pain are recognized effects of exposure to microgravity, however, spinal health has received relatively little attention. This changed with the report of an increased risk of post-flight intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation and subsequent identification of spinal pathophysiology in some astronauts post-flight. Ground-based analogs, particularly bed rest, suggest that a loss of spinal curvature and IVD swelling may be factors contributing to unloading-induced spinal elongation. In flight, trunk muscle atrophy, in particular multifidus, may precipitate lumbar curvature loss and reduced spinal stability, but in-flight (ultrasound) and pre- and post-flight (MRI) imaging have yet to detect significant IVD changes. Current International Space Station missions involve short periods of moderate-to-high spinal (axial) loading during running and resistance exercise, superimposed upon a background of prolonged unloading (microgravity). Axial loading acting on a dysfunctional spine, weakened by anatomical changes and local muscle atrophy, might increase the risk of damage/injury. Alternatively, regular loading may be beneficial. Spinal pathology has been identified in-flight, but there are few contemporary reports of in-flight back injury and no recent studies of post-flight back injury incidence. Accurate routine in-flight stature measurements, in- and post-flight imaging, and tracking of pain and injury (herniation) for at least 2 years post-flight is thus warranted. These should be complemented by ground-based studies, in particular hyper buoyancy floatation (HBF) a novel analog of spinal unloading, in order to elucidate the mechanisms and risk of spinal injury, and to evaluate countermeasures for exploration where injury could be mission critical.

N2  - Tropisms are growth-mediated plant movements that help plants to respond to changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, as well as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses.We also highlight research done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out in the absence of a significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, also are key mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space Station will clarify some of the mechanisms and molecular players of the plant responses to these environmental signals involved in tropisms and the cell cycle.

N2  - Discogenic back pain is multifactorial; hence, physicians often struggle to identify the underlying source of the pain. As a result, discogenic back pain is often hard to treat-even more so when clinical treatment strategies are of questionable efficacy. Based on a broad literature review, our aim was to define discogenic back pain into a series of more specific and interacting pathologies, and to highlight the need to develop novel approaches and treatment strategies for this challenging and unmet clinical need. Discogenic pain involves degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc, including structural defects that result in biomechanical instability and inflammation. These degenerative changes in intervertebral discs closely intersect with the peripheral and central nervous systems to cause nerve sensitization and ingrowth; eventually central sensitization results in a chronic pain condition. Existing imaging modalities are nonspecific to pain symptoms, whereas discography methods that are more specific have known comorbidities based on intervertebral disc puncture and injection. As a result, alternative noninvasive and specific diagnostic methods are needed to better diagnose and identify specific conditions and sources of pain that can be more directly treated. Currently, there are many treatments/interventions for discogenic back pain. Nevertheless, many surgical approaches for discogenic pain have limited efficacy, thus accentuating the need for the development of novel treatments. Regenerative therapies, such as biologics, cell-based therapy, intervertebral disc repair, and gene-based therapy, offer the most promise and have many advantages over current therapies. © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - Study Design.Prospective case series.Objective.Determine the extent of paraspinal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and attenuation change after long-duration spaceflight and recovery on Earth. Determine association between in-flight exercise and muscle atrophy.Summary of Background Data.Long-duration spaceflight leads to marked muscle atrophy. However, another negative consequence of disuse is intramuscular fatty infiltration. Notably, few studies have investigated the effects of spaceflight on intramuscular fatty infiltration, or how muscle atrophy is associated with in-flight exercise.Methods.We analyzed computed tomography scans of the lumbar spine (L1/L2) from 17 long-duration astronauts and cosmonauts to determine paraspinal muscle CSA and attenuation. Computed tomography scans were collected preflight, postflight, 1-year postflight, and, in a subset, 2 to 4 years postflight. We measured CSA (mm2) and attenuation (Hounsfield Units) of the erector spinae (ES), multifidus (MF), psoas (PS), and quadratus lumborum (QL) muscles. We used paired t tests to compare muscle morphology at each postflight time point to preflight values and Pearson correlation coefficients to determine the association between muscle changes and in-flight exercise.Results.ES, MF, and QL CSA and attenuation were significantly decreased postflight compared with preflight (-4.6% to-8.4% and-5.9% to-8.8%, respectively, p<0.05 for all). CSA of these muscles equaled or exceeded preflight values upon Earth recovery, however QL and PS attenuation remained below preflight values at 2 to 4 years postflight. More resistance exercise was associated with less decline in ES and MF CSA, but greater decline in PS CSA. Increased cycle ergometer exercise was associated with less decline of QL CSA. There were no associations between in-flight exercise and muscle attenuation.Conclusion.Both CSA and attenuation of paraspinal muscles decline after long-duration spaceflight, but while CSA returns to preflight values within 1 year of recovery, PS and QL muscle attenuation remain reduced even 2 to 4 years postflight. Spaceflight-induced changes in paraspinal muscle morphology may contribute to back pain commonly reported in astronauts.Level of Evidence: 4.

N2  - Purpose: Intervertebral kinematic assessments have been used to investigate mechanical causes when back pain is resistant to treatment, and recent studies have identified intervertebral motion markers that discriminate patients from controls. However, such patients are a heterogeneous group, some of whom have structural disruption, but the effects of this on intervertebral kinematics are unknown. Methods: Thirty-seven patients with treatment-resistant back pain referred for quantitative fluoroscopy were matched to an equal number of pain-free controls for age and sex. All received passive recumbent flexion assessments for intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI), variability (MSV), laxity and translation. Comparisons were made between patient subgroups, between patients and controls and against normative levels from a separate group of controls. Results: Eleven patients had had surgical or interventional procedures, and ten had spondylolisthesis or pars defects. Sixteen had no disruption. Patients had significantly higher median MSI values (0.30) than controls (0.27, p = 0.010), but not MSV (patients 0.08 vs controls 0.08, p = 0.791). Patients who received invasive procedures had higher median MSI values (0.37) than those with bony defects (0.30, p = 0.018) or no disruption (0.28, p = 0.0007). Laxity and translation above reference limits were not more prevalent in patients. Conclusion: Patients with treatment-resistant nonspecific back pain have greater MSI values than controls, especially if the former have received spinal surgery. However, excessive laxity, translation and MSV are not more prevalent in these patients. Thus, MSI should be investigated as a pain mechanism and for its possible value as a prognostic factor and/or target for treatment in larger patient populations.

N2  - Purpose: Evidence of intervertebral mechanical markers in chronic, non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) is lacking. This research used dynamic fluoroscopic studies to compare intervertebral angular motion sharing inequality and variability (MSI and MSV) during continuous lumbar motion in CNSLBP patients and controls. Passive recumbent and active standing protocols were used and the relationships of these variables to age and disc degeneration were assessed. Methods: Twenty patients with CNSLBP and 20 matched controls received quantitative fluoroscopic lumbar spine examinations using a standardised protocol for data collection and image analysis. Composite disc degeneration (CDD) scores comprising the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grades from L2–S1 were obtained. Indices of intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI) and variability (MSV) were derived and expressed in units of proportion of lumbar range of motion from outward and return motion sequences during lying (passive) and standing (active) lumbar bending and compared between patients and controls. Relationships between MSI, MSV, age and CDD were assessed by linear correlation. Results: MSI was significantly greater in the patients throughout the intervertebral motion sequences of recumbent flexion (0.29 vs. 0.22, p = 0.02) and when flexion, extension, left and right motion were combined to give a composite measure (1.40 vs. 0.92, p = 0.04). MSI correlated substantially with age (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) and CDD (R = 0.70, p = 0.03) in lying passive investigations in patients and not in controls. There were also substantial correlations between MSV and age (R = 0.77, p = 0.01) and CDD (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) in standing flexion in patients and not in controls. Conclusion: Greater inequality and variability of motion sharing was found in patients with CNSLBP than in controls, confirming previous studies and suggesting a biomechanical marker for the disorder at intervertebral level. The relationship between disc degeneration and MSI was augmented in patients, but not in controls during passive motion and similarly for MSV during active motion, suggesting links between in vivo disc mechanics and pain generation.

N2  - Motor control exercise has been shown to be effective in the management of low back pain (LBP). However, the effect sizes for motor control exercise are modest, possibly because studies have used a one-size-fits-all approach, while the literature suggests that patients may differ in presence or type of motor control issues. In this commentary, we address the question of whether consideration of such variation in motor control issues might contribute to more personal¬ ized motor control exercise for patients with LBP. Such an approach is plausible, because motor control changes may play a role in persistence of pain through effects on tissue loading that may cause nociceptive afference, particularly in the case of peripheral sensitization. Subgrouping systems used in clinical practice, which comprise motor control aspects, allow reliable classification that is, in part, aligned with findings in studies on motor control in patients with LBP. Motor control issues may have heuristic value for treatment allocation, as the different presentations observed suggest different targets for motor control exercise, but this remains to be proven. Finally, clinical assessment of patients with LBP should take into account more aspects than motor control alone, including pain mechanisms, musculoskeletal health, and psychosocial factors, and may need to be embedded in a stratification approach based on prognosis to avoid undue diagnostic procedures.

N2  - patients with low back pain demonstrate differences in all aspects of trunk motor control that are most often studied as differences in muscle activity and kinematics. However, differences in these aspects of motor control are largely inconsistent. We propose that this may reflect the existence of 2 phenotypes or possibly the ends of a spectrum, with “tight control” over trunk movement at one end and “loose control” at the other. Both may have beneficial effects, with tight control protecting against large tissue strains from uncontrolled movement and loose control protecting against high muscle forces and resulting spinal compression. Both may also have long-term negative consequences. For example, whereas tight control may cause high compressive loading on the spine and sustained muscle activity, loose control may cause excessive tensile strains of tissues. Moreover, both phenotypes could be the result of either an adaptation process aimed at protecting the low back or direct interference of low back pain and related changes with trunk motor control. The existence of such phenotypes would suggest different motor control exercise interventions. Although some promising data supporting these phenotypes have been reported, it remains to be shown whether these phenotypes are valid, how treatment can be targeted to these phenotypes, and whether this targeting yields superior clinical outcomes.

N2  - Although biomechanics plays a role in the development and perhaps the persistent or recurrent nature of low back pain (LBP), whether biomechanics alone can provide the basis for intervention is debated. Biomechanics, which refers to the mechanics of the body, including its neuromuscular control, has been studied extensively in LBP. But, can gains be made in understanding LBP by research focused on this component of biology in the multifactorial biopsychosocial problem of LBP? This commentary considers whether biomechanics research has the potential to advance treatment of LBP, and how likely it is that this research will lead to better treatment strategies. A point-counterpoint format is taken to present both sides of the argument. First, the challenges faced by an approach that considers biomechanics in isolation are presented. Next, we describe 3 models that place substantial emphasis on biomechanical factors. Finally, reactions to each point are presented as a foundation for further research and clinical practice to progress understanding of the place for biomechanics in guiding treatment of LBP.

N2  - Pain is complex. It is no longer acceptable to consider pain solely as a peripheral phenomenon involving activation of nociceptive neurons. The contemporary understanding of pain involves consideration of different underlying pain mechanisms and an increasing awareness of plasticity in all of the biological systems. Of note, recent advances in technology and understanding have highlighted the critical importance of neuroimmune interactions, both in the peripheral and central nervous systems, and the interaction between the nervous system and body tissues in the development and maintenance of pain, including low back pain (LBP). Further, the biology of many tissues changes when challenged by pain and injury, as reported in a growing body of literature on the biology of muscle, fat, and connective tissue. These advances in understanding of the complexity of LBP have implications for our understanding of pain and its interaction with the motor system, and may change how we consider motor control in the rehabilitation of LBP. This commentary provides a state-of-the-art overview of plasticity of biology in LBP. The paper is divided into 4 parts that address (1) biology of pain mechanisms, (2) neuroimmune interaction in the central nervous system, (3) neuroimmune interaction in the periphery, and (4) brain and peripheral tissue interaction. Each section considers the implications for clinical management of LBP.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, low back pain (LBP) is studied using a reductionist approach, in which the factors contributing to the clinical presentation of LBP are studied in isolation to identify the primary pathology or condition linked to LBP. We argue that reductionism may not be suitable for studying LBP, considering the complex, multifactorial nature of this condition. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the likelihood of successfully subclassifying patients with LBP and effectively targeting treatment based on a single dominant factor contributing to LBP. METHODS: Both analytical and numerical simulations (Monte Carlo) of 1 million patients with LBP were performed. Several factors contributing to LBP were randomly assigned to each individual. The following outcome measures were computed, as a function of the number of factors: the percentage of individuals who could be subclassified by identifying a single factor exceeding a certain threshold, and the average reduction in LBP when treatment eliminates the largest contributing factor versus a multimodal treatment that eliminates a number of the randomly selected factors. RESULTS: With an increasing number of factors, the probability of subclassifying an individual to a subgroup based on a single factor tends toward zero. A multimodal treatment arbitrarily addressing any 2 or more factors was more effective than diagnosing and treating a single factor that maximally contributed to LBP. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that reductionism is not appropriate for subclassifying patients with LBP or for targeting treatment. The use of reductionist approaches may explain some of the challenges when creating LBP classification systems and designing effective treatment interventions.

N2  - Many approaches for low back pain (LBP) management focus on modifying motor control, which refers to motor, sensory, and central processes for control of posture and movement. A common assumption across approaches is that the way an individual loads the spine by typical postures, movements, and muscle activation strategies contributes to LBP symptom onset, persistence, and recovery. However, there are also divergent features from one approach to another. This commentary presents key principles of 4 clinical physical therapy approaches, including how each incorporates motor control in LBP management, the convergence and divergence of these approaches, and how they interface with medical LBP management. The approaches considered are movement system impairment syndromes of the lumbar spine, Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy, motor control training, and the integrated systems model. These were selected to represent the diversity of applications, including approaches using motor control as a central or an adjunct feature, and approaches that are evidence based or evidence informed. This identification of areas of convergence and divergence of approaches is designed to clarify the key aspects of each approach and thereby serve as a guide for the clinician and to provide a platform for considering a hybrid approach tailored to the individual patient.

N2  - Clinical instability is an important cause of low back pain. Although there is some controversy concerning its definition, it is most widely believed that the loss of normal pattern of spinal motion causes pain and/or neurologic dysfunction. The stabilizing system of the spine may be divided into three subsystems: (1) the spinal column; (2) the spinal muscles; and (3) the neural control unit. A large number of biomechanical studies of the spinal column have provided insight into the role of the various components of the spinal column in providing spinal stability. The neutral zone was found to be a more sensitive parameter than the range of motion in documenting the effects of mechanical destabilization of the spine caused by injury and restabilization of the spine by osteophyle formation, fusion or muscle stabilization. Clinical studies indicate that the application of an external fixator to the painful segment of the spine can significantly reduce the pain. Results of an in vitro simulation of the study found that it was most probably the decrease in the neutral zone, which was responsible for pain reduction. A hypothesis relating the neutral zone to pain has been presented. The spinal muscles provide significant stability to the spine as shown by both in vitro experiments and mathematical models. Concerning the role of neuromuscular control system, increased body sway has been found in patients with low back pain, indicating a less efficient muscle control system with decreased ability to provide the needed spinal stability. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  - Background and objectives: Low back pain is one of the most common health problems. In 85% of cases, it is not possible to identify a specific cause, and it is therefore called Non-Specific Low Back Pain (NSLBP). Among the various attempted classifications, the subgroup of patients with impairment of motor control of the lower back (MCI) is between the most studied. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the results from trials about validity and reliability of clinical tests aimed to identify MCI in the NSLBP population. Materials and Methods: The MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and MedNar databases have been searched until May 2018. The criteria for inclusion were clinical trials about evaluation methods that are affordable and applicable in a usual clinical setting and conducted on populations aged > 18 years. A single author summarized data in synoptic tables relating to the clinical property; a second reviewer intervened in case of doubts about the relevance of the studies. Results: 13 primary studies met the inclusion criteria: 10 investigated inter-rater reliability, 4 investigated intra-rater reliability, and 6 investigated validity for a total of 23 tests (including one cluster of tests). Inter-rater reliability is widely studied, and there are tests with good, consistent, and substantial values (waiter’s bow, prone hip extension, sitting knee extension, and one leg stance). Intra-rater reliability has been less investigated, and no test have been studied for more than one author. The results of the few studies about validity aim to discriminate only the presence or absence of LBP in the samples. Conclusions: At the state of the art, results related to reliability support the clinical use of the identified tests. No conclusions can be drawn about validity.

N2  - Low back pain (LBP) is an important medical and socioeconomic problem. Impaired sensorimotor control has been suggested to be a likely mechanism underlying development and/or maintenance of pain. Although early work focused on the structural and functional abnormalities within the musculoskeletal system, in the past 20 years there has been an increasing realization that patients with LBP might also have extensive neuroplastic changes within the central nervous system. These include changes related to both the structure (eg, gray matter changes) and function (eg, organization of the sensory and motor cortices) of the nervous system as related to processing of pain and nociception and to motor and somatosensory systems. Moreover, clinical interventions increasingly aim to drive neuroplasticity with treatments to improve pain and sensorimotor function. This commentary provides a contemporary overview of neuroplasticity of the pain/nociceptive and sensorimotor systems in LBP. This paper addresses (1) defining neuroplasticity in relation to control of the spine and LBP, (2) structural and functional nervous system changes as they relate to nonspecific LBP and sensorimotor function, and (3) related clinical implications. Individuals with recurrent and persistent LBP differ from those without LBP in several markers of the nervous system's function and structure. Neuroplastic changes may be addressed by top-down cognitive-based interventions and bottom-up physical interventions. An integrated clinical approach that combines contemporary pain neuroscience education, cognition-targeted sensorimotor control, and physical or function-based treatments may lead to better outcomes in patients with recurrent and persistent LBP. This approach will need to consider variation among individuals, as no single finding/mechanism is present in all individuals, and no single treatment that targets neuroplastic changes in the sensorimotor system is likely to be effective for all patients with LBP.

N2  - Individuals with back pain are often diagnosed with spine instability, even though it is unclear whether the spine is susceptible to unstable behavior. The spine is a complex system with many elements that cannot be directly observed, which makes the study of spine function and direct assessment of spine instability difficult. What is known is that trunk muscle activation is adjusted to meet stability demands, which highlights that the central nervous system closely monitors threats to spine stability. The spine appears to be protected by neural coupling and mechanical coupling that prevent erroneous motor control from producing segmental instability; however, this neural and mechanical coupling could be problematic in an injured spine. Finally, instability traditionally contemplated from a mechanical and control perspective could potentially be applied to study processes involved in pain sensitization, and possibly back pain that is iatrogenic in nature. This commentary argues for a more contemporary and broadened view of stability that integrates interdisciplinary knowledge in order to capture the complexity of back pain.

N2  - Since the publication of the 2nd edition of White and Panjabi's textbook, Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine in 1990, there has been considerable research on the biomechanics of the spine. The focus of this manuscript will be to review what we have learned in regards to the fundamentals of spine biomechanics. Topics addressed include the whole spine, the functional spinal unit, and the individual components of the spine (e.g. vertebra, intervertebral disc, spinal ligaments). In these broad categories, our understanding in 1990 is reviewed and the important knowledge or understanding gained through the subsequent 25 years of research is highlighted. Areas where our knowledge is lacking helps to identify promising topics for future research. In this manuscript, as in the White and Panjabi textbook, the emphasis is on experimental research using human material, either in vivo or in vitro. The insights gained from mathematical models and animal experimentation are included where other data are not available. This review is intended to celebrate the substantial gains that have been made in the field over these past 25 years and also to identify future research directions.

N2  - Spinal health depends on optimal back muscle performance, and this is determined by muscle structure and function. There has been substantial research evaluating the differences in structure and function of many back muscles, including the multifidus and erector spinae, but with considerable variation in results. Many studies have shown atrophy, fat infiltration, and connective tissue accumulation in back muscles, particularly deep fibers of the multifidus, but the results are not uniform. In terms of function, results are also somewhat inconsistent, often reporting lower multifidus activation and augmented recruitment of more superficial components of the multifidus and erector spinae, but, again, with variation between studies. A major recent observation has been the identification of time-dependent differences in features of back muscle adaptation, from acute to subacute/recurrent to chronic states of the condition. Further, these adaptations have been shown to be explained by different time-dependent mechanisms. This has substantial impact on the rationale for rehabilitation approaches. The aim of this commentary was to review and consolidate the breadth of research investigating adaptation in back muscle structure and function, to consider explanations for some of the variation between studies, and to propose how this model can be used to guide rehabilitation in a manner that is tailored to individual patients and to underlying mechanisms.

N2  - Various approaches have been used to guide the treatment of low back pain. These approaches have been considered in isolation and often tested against each other. An alternative view is that a model of care that involves a hybrid approach may benefit patients with low back pain. This commentary considers the potential benefits of a sequentially applied hybrid approach for treatment tailoring to optimize resource allocation to those most likely to require comprehensive care, and then decision making toward treatment paths with the greatest potential for success. In a first step, a prognosis-based approach, such as the Subgroups for Targeted Treatment Back Screening Tool (STarT Back), identifies individuals likely to require greater resource allocation. Although a clear path is indicated toward simple and psychologically informed care for the low- and high-risk groups, respectively, there is limited guidance for the large medium-risk group. For that group, the hybrid model provides a stepwise path of additional methods to guide treatment selection. This includes subgrouping based on pain mechanism to guide priority domains for the next phase, which includes tailoring of psychological and movement-based approaches. Motor control approaches to exercise would be indicated for individuals with medium risk and a nociceptive pain mechanism, with treatment guided by detailed assessment via one of several paradigms. Psychologically informed treatments are tailored to those with medium risk and a predominantly central pain mechanism, guided by detailed assessment of psychosocial features. A hybrid approach to a model of care could simplify treatment selection and take advantage of the benefits of each method in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

N2  - The articles in this special issue on low back pain are the outcome of work undertaken by a series of working parties established during the meeting, "State-of-the-Art in Motor Control and Low Back Pain: International Clinical and Research Expert Forum," held in Chicago in October 2015. This multidisciplinary meeting provided an opportunity for discussion of key issues that interconnect motor control, pain, and the spine. What started as a relatively straightforward objective to summarize the field subsequently developed into an extensive process of literature review and discussion that culminated in the commentaries and articles presented in this special issue. We hope that the up-to-date information and in-depth insights into pain, motor control, and rehabilitation provide novel insights and a clear trajectory for future work and form the foundation for ongoing lively discussion.

N2  - Recent research using high-density electromyography (HDEMG) has provided a more precise understanding of the behaviour of the paraspinal muscles in people with low back pain (LBP); but so far, HDEMG has not been used to investigate the flexion relaxation phenomenon (FRP). To evaluate this, HDEMG signals were detected with grids of electrodes (13 × 5) placed bilaterally over the lumbar paraspinal muscles in individuals with and without LBP as they performed repetitions of full trunk flexion. The root mean square of the HDEMG signals was computed to generate the average normalized amplitude; and the spatial FRP onset was determined and expressed as percentage of trunk flexion. Smoothing spline analysis of variance models and the contrast cycle difference approach using the Bayesian interpretation were used to determine statistical inference. All pain-free controls and 64.3% of the individuals with LBP exhibited the FRP. Individuals with LBP and the FRP exhibited a delay of its onset compared to pain-free controls (significant mean difference of 13.3% of trunk flexion). They also showed reduced normalized amplitude compared to those without the FRP, but still greater than pain-free controls (significant mean difference of 27.4% and 11.6% respectively). This study provides novel insights into changes in lumbar muscle behavior in individuals with LBP.

N2  - Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a popular research tool in sport and rehabilitation sciences. Common study designs include the comparison of sEMG amplitudes collected from different muscles as participants perform various exercises and techniques under different loads. Based on such comparisons, researchers attempt to draw conclusions concerning the neuro- and electrophysiological underpinning of force production and hypothesize about possible longitudinal adaptations, such as strength and hypertrophy. However, such conclusions are frequently unsubstantiated and unwarranted. Hence, the goal of this review is to discuss what can and cannot be inferred from comparative research designs as it pertains to both the acute and longitudinal outcomes. General methodological recommendations are made, gaps in the literature are identified, and lines for future research to help improve the applicability of sEMG are suggested.

N2  - Non-specific chronic low back pain (nsCLBP) is a multifactorial condition of unknown etiology and pathogenesis. Physical and genetic factors may influence the predisposition of individuals to CLBP, which in many instances share a musculoskeletal origin. A reduced pain level in low back pain patients that participate in exercise therapy highlights that disuse-related muscle deconditioning may predispose individuals to nsCLBP. In this context, musculoskeletal pain may be the consequence of capillary rarefaction in inactive muscle as this would lower local tissue drainage and washing out of toxic waste. Muscle activity is translated into an angio-adaptative process, which implicates angiogenic-gene expression and individual response differences due to heritable modifications of such genes (gene polymorphisms). The pathophysiologic mechanism underlying nsCLBP is still largely unaddressed. We hypothesize that capillary rarefaction due to a deconditioning of dorsal muscle groups exacerbates nsCLBP by increasing noxious sensation, reducing muscle strength and fatigue resistance by initiating a downward spiral of local deconditioning of back muscles which diminishes their load-bearing capacity. We address the idea that specific factors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and Tenascin-C might play an important role in altering susceptibility to nsCLBP via their effects on microvascular perfusion and vascular remodeling of skeletal muscle, inflammation, and pain sensation. The genetic profile may help to explain the individual predisposition to nsCLBP, thus identifying subgroups of patients, which could benefit from ad hoc treatment types. Future therapeutic approaches aimed at relieving the pain associated with nsCLBP should be based on the verification of mechanistic processes of activity-induced angio-adaptation and muscle-perfusion.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) on autonomic nervous system (ANS)-mediated outcomes, in both symptomatic and healthy populations, and to assess the quality of evidence for the most prevalent outcomes with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched from their inception to March 2014. Randomized controlled trials involving SMT, such as mobilization and manipulation, that reported at least 1 outcome related to the ANS, with placebo, control groups, or other SMT techniques as comparators, with either healthy or symptomatic samples were included. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach were used to assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, respectively. Results: Eighteen trials were included in this systematic review. Passive accessory intervertebral mobilization produced sympathoexcitation independently of the treated region (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine); although sustained natural apophyseal glides did not influence the ANS, conflicting results were observed regarding manipulation techniques. The overall quality of evidence for all analyzed outcomes ranged from low to very low quality. Conclusion: There is evidence pointing toward the existence of sympathoexcitatory short-term effects following passive accessory intervertebral mobilization mobilizations, but not for sustained natural apophyseal glide mobilizations. There is conflicting evidence regarding the ability of manipulation to elicit sympathoexcitation. However, the low quality of the evidence precludes a definitive conclusion of such effects. Based on the current evidence, there is uncertainty regarding the true effect estimates of SMT on ANS-mediated outcomes.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to review the biomedical literature to ascertain the biomechanical and clinical significance of the lumbar erector spinae flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP). Data Sources: Index Medicus via PubMed, the Noble Science Library's e-journal archives, and the Manual Alternative and Natural Therapy Index System databases were searched using the same search terms. Discussion: The presence of the FRP during trunk flexion represents myoelectric silence consistent with increased load sharing of the posterior discoligamentous passive structures. Passive contributions from erector spinae stretching during the flexion posture and active contributions from other muscles (quadratus lumborum and deep erector spinae among others) further assist in load sharing in the trunk flexion posture. A number of studies have shown differences in the FRP between patients with chronic low back pain and healthy individuals, and the reliability of the assessment. Persistent activation of the lumbar erector spinae musculature among patients with back pain may represent the body's attempt to stabilize injured or diseased spinal structures via reflexogenic ligamentomuscular activation thereby protecting them from further injury and avoiding pain. Conclusions: The myoelectric silencing of the erector spinae muscles in the trunk flexion posture is indicative of increased load sharing on passive structures, which tissues have been found to fail under excessive loading conditions and shown to be a source of low back pain. The studies that show differences in the presence of the FRP among patients and control subjects are encouraging for this type of clinical assessment and suggest that assessment of the FRP is a valuable objective clinical tool to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with low back pain.

N2  - Background: Lumbar muscle dysfunction due to pain might be related to altered lumbar muscle structure. Macroscopically, muscle degeneration in low back pain (LBP) is characterized by a decrease in cross-sectional area and an increase in fat infiltration in the lumbar paraspinal muscles. In addition microscopic changes, such as changes in fiber distribution, might occur. Inconsistencies in results from different studies make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on which structural changes are present in the different types of non-specific LBP. Insights regarding structural muscle alterations in LBP are, however, important for prevention and treatment of non-specific LBP. Objective: The goal of this article is to review which macro- and/or microscopic structural alterations of the lumbar muscles occur in case of non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP), recurrent low back pain (RLBP), and acute low back pain (ALBP). Study Design: Systematic review. Setting: All selected studies were case-control studies. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed and Web of Science. Only full texts of original studies regarding structural alterations (atrophy, fat infiltration, and fiber type distribution) in lumbar muscles of patients with non-specific LBP compared to healthy controls were included. All included articles were scored on methodological quality. Results: Fifteen studies were found eligible after screening title, abstract, and full text for inclusion and exclusion criteria. In CLBP, moderate evidence of atrophy was found in the multifidus; whereas, results in the paraspinal and the erector spinae muscle remain inconclusive. Also moderate evidence occurred in RLBP and ALBP, where no atrophy was shown in any lumbar muscle. Conflicting results were seen in undefined LBP groups. Results concerning fat infiltration were inconsistent in CLBP. On the other hand, there is moderate evidence in RLBP that fat infiltration does not occur, although a larger muscle fat index was found in the erector spinae, multifidus, and paraspinal muscles, reflecting an increased relative amount of intramuscular lipids in RLBP. However, no studies were found investigating fat infiltration in ALBP. Restricted evidence indicates no abnormalities in fiber type in the paraspinal muscles in CLBP. No studies have examined fiber type in ALBP and RLBP. Limitations: Lack of clarity concerning patient definitions, exact LBP symptoms, and applied methods. Conclusions: The results indicate atrophy in CLBP in the multifidus and paraspinal muscles but not in the erector spinae. No atrophy was shown in RLBP and ALBP. Fat infiltration did not occur in RLBP, but results in CLBP were inconsistent. No abnormalities in fiber type in the paraspinal muscles were found in CLBP.

N2  - The purpose of this brief review is to present evidence from experimental and clinical neck pain studies of pain-induced neuromuscular adaptations. It has been shown that clinical neck pain is associated with a substantial reorganization in the control strategies of cervical muscles during static and dynamic tasks. Experimental neck pain models allow local elicitation of nociceptive afferents, mimicking the sensory aspects of clinical pain, without major changes in muscle properties. These models may help understand the physiological mechanisms underlying the observations from clinical neck pain studies. The knowledge obtained from the interpretation of clinical findings with experimental pain models has relevance for the development of therapeutic interventions for the rehabilitation of patients with neck pain disorders. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background Context Heterogeneity exists within the low back pain (LBP) population. Some patients recover after every pain episode, whereas others suffer daily from LBP complaints. Until now, studies rarely make a distinction between recurrent low back pain (RLBP) and chronic low back pain (CLBP), although both are characterized by a different clinical picture. Clinical experiences also indicate that heterogeneity exists within the CLBP population. Muscle degeneration, like atrophy, fat infiltration, alterations in muscle fiber type, and altered muscle activity, compromises proper biomechanics and motion of the spinal units in LBP patients. The amount of alterations in muscle structure and muscle function of the paraspinal muscles might be related to the recurrence or chronicity of LBP. Purpose The aim of this experimental study is to evaluate differences in muscle structure (cross-sectional area and lean muscle fat index) and muscle activity of the multifidus (MF) and erector spinae (ES) during trunk extension, in patients with RLBP, non-continuous CLBP, and continuous CLBP. Study Design and Setting This cross-sectional study took place in the university hospital of Ghent, Belgium. Muscle structure characteristics and muscle activity were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patient Sample Fifty-five adults with non-specific LBP (24 RLBP in remission, 15 non-continuous CLBP, 16 continuous CLBP) participated in this study. Outcome Measures Total cross-sectional area, muscle cross-sectional area, fat cross-sectional area, lean muscle fat index, T2-rest and T2-shift were assessed. Methods A T1-weighted Dixon MRI scan was used to evaluate spinal muscle cross-sectional area and fat infiltration in the lumbar MF and ES. Muscle functional MRI was used to evaluate the muscle activity of the lumbar MF and ES during a lumbar extension exercise. Before and after the exercise, a pain assessment was performed. This study was supported by grants from the Special Research Fund of Ghent University (DEF12/AOP/022) without potential conflict of interest-associated biases in the text of the paper. Results Fat cross-sectional area and lean muscle fat index were significantly higher in MF and ES in continuous CLBP compared with non-continuous CLBP and RLBP (p<.05). No differencesbetween groups were found for total cross-sectional area and muscle cross-sectional area in MF or ES (p>.05). Also, no significant differences between groups for T2-rest were established. T2-shift, however, was significantly lower in MF and ES in RLBP compared with, respectively, non-continuous CLBP and continuous CLBP (p<.05). Conclusions These results indicate a higher amount of fat infiltration in the lumbar muscles, in the absence of clear atrophy, in continuous CLBP compared with RLBP. A lower metabolic activity of the lumbar muscles was seen in RLBP replicating a relative lower intensity in contractions performed by the lumbar muscles in RLBP compared with non-continuous and continuous CLBP. In conclusion, RLBP differs from continuous CLBP for both muscle structure and muscle function, whereas non-continuous CLBP seems comparable with RLBP for lumbar muscle structure and with continuous CLBP for lumbar muscle function. These results underline the differences in muscle structure and muscle function between different LBP populations.

N2  - Background: Sympathetic nervous activity contributes to the maintenance of muscle oxygenation. However, patients with chronic pain may suffer from autonomic dysfunction. Furthermore, insufficient muscle oxygenation is observed among workers with chronic neck and shoulder pain. The aim of our study was to investigate how muscle load tasks affect sympathetic nervous activity and changes in oxygenation of the trapezius muscles in subjects with chronic neck and shoulder pain. Methods. Thirty females were assigned to two groups: a pain group consisting of subjects with chronic neck and shoulder pain and a control group consisting of asymptomatic subjects. The participants performed three sets of isometric exercise in an upright position; they contracted their trapezius muscles with maximum effort and let the muscles relax (Relax). Autonomic nervous activity and oxygenation of the trapezius muscles were measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy. Results: Oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin of the trapezius muscles in the pain group were lower during the Relax period compared with the control group. In addition, the low frequency / high frequency (LF/HF) ratio of HRV significantly increased during isometric exercise in the control group, whereas there were no significant changes in the pain group. Conclusions: Subjects with neck and shoulder pain showed lower oxygenation and blood flow of the trapezius muscles responding to isometric exercise, compared with asymptomatic subjects. Subjects with neck and shoulder pain also showed no significant changes in the LF/HF ratio of HRV responding to isometric exercise, which would imply a reduction in sympathetic nervous activity. © 2012 Shiro et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - The purpose of this brief review is to present evidence from experimental and clinical neck pain studies of pain-induced neuromuscular adaptations. It has been shown that clinical neck pain is associated with a substantial reorganization in the control strategies of cervical muscles during static and dynamic tasks. Experimental neck pain models allow local elicitation of nociceptive afferents, mimicking the sensory aspects of clinical pain, without major changes in muscle properties. These models may help understand the physiological mechanisms underlying the observations from clinical neck pain studies. The knowledge obtained from the interpretation of clinical findings with experimental pain models has relevance for the development of therapeutic interventions for the rehabilitation of patients with neck pain disorders. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Purpose of review Continuous wave near infrared spectroscopy (CW NIRS) provides non-invasive technology to measure relative changes in oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin in a dynamic environment. This allows determination of local skeletal muscle O2 saturation, muscle oxygen consumption ( V˙O2 ) and blood flow. This article provides a brief overview of the use of CW NIRS to measure exercise-limiting factors in skeletal muscle. Recent findings NIRS parameters that measure O2 delivery and capacity to utilise O2 in the muscle have been developed based on response to physiological interventions and exercise. NIRS has good reproducibility and agreement with gold standard techniques and can be used in clinical populations where muscle oxidative capacity or oxygen delivery (or both) are impaired. CW NIRS has limitations including: the unknown contribution of myoglobin to the overall signals, the impact of adipose tissue thickness, skin perfusion during exercise, and variations in skin pigmentation. These, in the main, can be circumvented through appropriate study design or measurement of absolute tissue saturation. Summary CW NIRS can assess skeletal muscle O2 delivery and utilisation without the use of expensive or invasive procedures and is useable in large population-based samples, including older adults.

N2  - Introduction Chronic, non-specific low back pain is a major global cause of disability. One factor which might potentially contribute to ongoing pain is maladaptive variation in the level of activity in the lumbar musculature. Several studies have investigated this activity using surface electromyography, in varied muscles and during a number of functional activities. Due to differences in the applied methodology, the results have been difficult to compare, and previous reviews have been limited in scope. In this protocol, we aim to perform a comprehensive review of the effect of chronic low back pain on lumbar muscle activity. Methods and analysis This protocol was informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and results will be reported in line with the PRISMA. Searches will be conducted on the Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ZETOC and CINAHL databases, along with a comprehensive review of grey literature and key journals. One reviewer will conduct the searches, but two independent reviewers will screen potential studies and assess the risk of bias within studies which meet the inclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa risk of bias tool, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines will be used to assess the quality of the data. Meta-analysis will be conducted where appropriate on groups of studies with homogenous methodology. Where studies are too heterogeneous to allow for meta-analysis, meta-synthesis will instead be completed, comparing results in terms of net increases or decreases of activity. Ethics and dissemination This review aims to identify common adaptations of muscle activity in people with low back pain and it is expected that the results will influence future research directions and future rehabilitation approaches. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. Prospero registration number CRD42019125156

N2  - The diagnosis of lumbar spine pathologies such as lower back pain (LBP) is extremely difficult, and a consensus regarding a diagnostic standard has not yet been reached. Accurate measurement of intervertebral kinematic parameters helps to understand the etiology and diagnosis of related diseases, and to evaluate the subsequent treatment. Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) which can obtain continuous, dynamic image sequences of lumbar motion at low radiation doses were introduced. The estimation of intervertebral kinematics depends on the precise localization of lumbar vertebrae. Usually, vertebral corners are identified and tracked by automated methods or manual method. This study presents a novel method for vertebral tracking based on the KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi, KLT) algorithm for intervertebral kinematics analysis. Accuracy of the proposed method was tested using a sagittal human image which contained two vertebral bodies, and the average errors achieved for displacement and angle were within 0.25 mm and 0.3°, respectively. To test the proposed method under clinical conditions, totally 11 volunteers were recruited and a result of more smoothness and stability in the intervertebral kinematics was obtained with comparing to the manual method by an experienced and trained clinician. In conclusion, the proposed method is an effective, accurate way to assess lumbar vertebrae tracking.

N2  - BACKGROUND
Disc height loss and osteophytes change the local mechanical environment in the spine; while previous research has examined kinematic dysfunction under degenerative change, none has looked at the influence of disc height loss and osteophytes throughout movement. 

METHODS
Twenty patients with pain related to the head, neck or shoulders were imaged via videofluoroscopy as they underwent sagittal-plane flexion and extension. A clinician graded disc height loss and osteophytes as “severe/moderate”, “mild”, or “none”. A novel tracking algorithm quantified motions of each vertebra. This information was used to calculate intervertebral angular and shear displacements. The digital algorithm made it practical to track individual vertebrae in multiple patients through hundreds of images without bias. 

FINDINGS
Cases without height loss/osteophytes had a consistent increase in intervertebral angular displacement from C2/C3 to C5/C6, like that of healthy individuals, and mild height losses did not produce aberrations that were systematic or necessarily discernable. However, joints with moderate to severe disc height loss and osteophytes exhibited reduced range of motion compared to adjacent unaffected joints in that patient and corresponding joints in patients without structural irregularities. 

INTERPRETATION
Digitally-obtained motion histories of individual joints allowed anatomical joint changes to be linked with changes in joint movement patterns. Specifically, disc height loss and osteophytes were found to influence cervical spine movement in the sagittal plane, reducing angular motions at affected joints by approximately 10% between those with and without height loss and osteophytes. Further, these joint changes were associated with perturbed intervertebral angular and shear movements.

N2  - Molecular events that drive disc damage and low back pain (LBP) may precede clinical manifestation of disease onset and can cause detrimental long-term effects such as disability. Biomarkers serve as objective molecular indicators of pathological processes. The goal of this study is to identify systemic biochemical factors as predictors of response to treatment of LBP with epidural steroid injection (ESI). Since inflammation plays a pivotal role in LBP, this pilot study investigates the effect of ESI on systemic levels of 48 inflammatory biochemical factors (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) and examines the relationship between biochemical factor levels and pain or disability in patients with disc herniation (DH), or other diagnoses (Other Dx) leading to low back pain, which included spinal stenosis (SS) and degenerative disc disease (DDD). Study participants (n = 16) were recruited from a back pain management practice. Pain numerical rating score (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and blood samples were collected pre- and at 7 to 10 days post-treatment. Blood samples were assayed for inflammatory mediators using commercial multiplex assays. Mediator levels were compared pre- and post-treatment to investigate the potential correlations between clinical and biochemical outcomes. Our results indicate that a single ESI significantly decreased systemic levels of SCGF-β and IL-2. Improvement in pain in all subjects was correlated with changes in chemokines (MCP-1, MIG), hematopoietic progenitor factors (SCGF-β), and factors that participate in angiogenesis/fibrosis (HGF), nociception (SCF, IFN-α2), and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TRAIL). Levels of biochemical mediators varied based on diagnosis of LBP, and changes in pain responses and systemic mediators from pre- to post-treatment were dependent on the diagnosis cohort. In the DH cohort, levels of IL-17 and VEGF significantly decreased post-treatment. In the Other Dx cohort, levels of IL-2Rα, IL-3, and SCGF-β significantly decreased post-treatment. In order to determine whether mediator changes were related to pain, correlations between change in pain scores and change in mediator levels were performed. Subjects with DH demonstrated a profile signature that implicated hematopoiesis factors (SCGF-β, GM-CSF) in pain response, while subjects with Other Dx demonstrated a biomarker profile that implicated chemokines (MCP-1, MIG) and angiogenic factors (HGF, VEGF) in pain response. Our findings provide evidence that systemic biochemical factors in patients with LBP vary by diagnosis, and pain response to treatment is associated with a unique profile of biochemical responses in each diagnosis group. Future hypothesis-based studies with larger subject cohorts are warranted to confirm the findings of this pilot exploratory study.

N2  - Purpose: Low back pain (LBP) is the most disabling condition worldwide. Although LBP relates to different spinal pathologies, vertebral bone marrow lesions visualized as Modic changes on MRI have a high specificity for discogenic LBP. This review summarizes the pathobiology of Modic changes and suggests a disease model. Methods: Non-systematic literature review. Results: Chemical and mechanical stimulation of nociceptors adjacent to damaged endplates are likely a source of pain. Modic changes are adjacent to a degenerated intervertebral disc and have three generally interconvertible types suggesting that the different Modic change types represent different stages of the same pathological process, which is characterized by inflammation, high bone turnover, and fibrosis. A disease model is suggested where disc/endplate damage and the persistence of an inflammatory stimulus (i.e., occult discitis or autoimmune response against disc material) create predisposing conditions. The risk to develop Modic changes likely depends on the inflammatory potential of the disc and the capacity of the bone marrow to respond to it. Bone marrow lesions in osteoarthritic knee joints share many characteristics with Modic changes adjacent to degenerated discs and suggest that damage-associated molecular patterns and marrow fat metabolism are important pathogenetic factors. There is no consensus on the ideal therapy. Non-surgical treatment approaches including intradiscal steroid injections, anti-TNF-α antibody, antibiotics, and bisphosphonates have some demonstrated efficacy in mostly non-replicated clinical studies in reducing Modic changes in the short term, but with unknown long-term benefits. New diagnostic tools and animal models are required to improve painful Modic change identification and classification, and to clarify the pathogenesis. Conclusion: Modic changes are likely to be more than just a coincidental imaging finding in LBP patients and rather represent an underlying pathology that should be a target for therapy.

N2  - Background Context Modic changes (MC) are bone marrow lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggestive of being associated with low back pain (LBP). Data on determinants of MC and their association with disc degeneration and other spinal phenotypes, as well as that of LBP, rely mostly on small-scale patient populations and remain controversial. Purpose This study addressed the potential determinants of MC and their association with disc degeneration and LBP among Southern Chinese. Study Design/Setting A cross-sectional, population-based study was carried out. Patient Sample This study consisted of 2,449 Southern Chinese volunteers. Methods Sagittal T2-weighted MRIs of the lumbar spine were assessed for the presence of MC and other spinal phenotypes (eg, disc degeneration, disc displacement, Schmorl nodes) in all individuals. Subjects' demographics, occupation, lifestyle, and clinical profiles were assessed. Results The overall prevalence of MC was 5.8% (n=141), which increased with advancing age. Modic changes predominantly occurred at the lowest two lumbar levels (83%). In the multivariate analyses, only the presence of disc displacement and a higher disc degeneration score were associated with MC at the upper lumbar levels (L1/L2-L3/L4) (p<.01). The presence of MC at the lowest two lumbar levels (L4/L5-L5/S1) were associated with age, the presence of Schmorl nodes, disc degeneration or displacement, and historical lumbar injury (p<.01). Subjects who were both smokers and overweight or obese had increased likelihood of MC in the lower spine (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.10-4.30). The presence of MC at the lower lumbar levels were associated with historical LBP (OR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.05-3.54) and with severity and duration of symptoms (p<.05). Conclusions Based on one of the largest MRI studies to assess lumbar MC, we noted that MC were associated with both disc degeneration and the presence and severity of LBP. Determinants and association of MC with disc degeneration and clinical symptoms in the upper versus the lower lumbar spine were different. Our study further stresses the significance of MC as important imaging phenotypes associated with LBP.

N2  - Low back pain (LBP) is the world's most disabling condition. Modic changes (MC) are vertebral bone marrow changes adjacent to the endplates as noted on magnetic resonance imaging. The associations of specific MC types and patterns with prolonged, severe LBP and disability remain speculative. This study assessed the relationship of prolonged, severe LBP and back-related disability, with the presence and morphology of lumbar MC in a large cross-sectional population-based study of Southern Chinese. We addressed the topographical and morphological dimensions of MC along with other magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes (eg, disc degeneration and displacement) on the basis of axial T1 and sagittal T2-weighted imaging of L1-S1. Prolonged severe LBP was defined as LBP lasting ≥30 days during the past year, and a visual analog scale severest pain intensity of at least 6/10. An Oswestry Disability Index score of 15% was regarded as significant disability. We also assessed subject demographics, occupation, and lifestyle factors. In total, 1142 subjects (63% females, mean age 53 years) were assessed. Of these, 282 (24.7%) had MC (7.1% type I, 17.6% type II). MC subjects were older (P=0.003), had more frequent disc displacements (P<0.001) and greater degree of disc degeneration (P<0.001) than non-MC subjects. In adjusted models, any MC (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.18), MC affecting whole anterior-posterior length (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.04-2.51), and MC affecting 2/3 posterior length (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.17-6.65) were associated with prolonged severe LBP. Type I MC tended to associate with pain more strongly than type II MC (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.94-3.44 vs OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.88-2.09, respectively). Any MC (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04-2.10), type II MC (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06-2.31), MC affecting 2/3 posterior length (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.27-6.89), and extensive MC (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.21-3.15) were associated with disability. The strength of the associations increased with the number of MC. This large-scale study is the first to definitively note MC types and specific morphologies to be independently associated with prolonged severe LBP and back-related disability. This proposed refined MC phenotype may have direct implications in clinical decision-making as to the development and management of LBP. Understanding of these imaging biomarkers can lead to new preventative and personalized therapeutics related to LBP.

N2  - Background:The pathogenesis of low back pain (LBP) remains unclear. However, recent studies suggest that the inflammatory response may be inherent in spinal pain. The purpose of this study was to discern inflammatory profiles in patients with nonspecific acute and chronic LBP in relation to those in asymptomatic individuals.Materials and Methods:Peripheral blood samples were obtained from asymptomatic controls and patients with nonspecific acute and chronic LBP reporting a minimum pain score of 3 on a 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The levels of in vitro production of proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα], interleukin [IL] 1β, IL-6, IL-2, interferon γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1 receptor antagonist, soluble receptors of TNF2, and IL-10) mediators were determined by specific immunoassays.Results:The mean VAS scores were comparable between the acute and chronic LBP patient groups. Compared with asymptomatic group, the production of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and their ratios to IL-10 levels were significantly elevated in both patient groups (P=0.0001 to 0.003). In acute LBP group, the ratio of IL-2:IL-10 was also significantly increased (P=0.02). In contrast, the production of interferon γ was significantly reduced compared with the other study groups (P=0.005 to 0.01), nevertheless, it was positively correlated (P=0.006) with pain scores. In chronic LBP patients, the production of TNFα, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and soluble receptors of TNF2 was significantly increased (P=0.001 to 0.03) in comparison with the control and acute LBP groups, and TNFα and IL-1β levels were positively correlated (P<0.001) with VAS scores.Conclusions:The inflammatory profiles of patients with acute and chronic LBP are distinct. Nonetheless, in both patient groups, an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediator levels favors the production of proinflammatory components.

N2  - Biomarker for prediction of development of low back pain, and disease progression in chronic conditions are virtually non-existent. In the present study, we examined evidence of inflammation in the peripheral blood and demonstrated significant changes in neuroinflammation markers in subjects with chronic low back pain in comparison with control subjects. The present study was performed using peripheral blood from subjects with chronic low back pain and age-matched control subjects. Western blotting, real-time RT-PCR, cell culture and in vitro assays were incorporated to perform the current study. We obtained evidence that the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines is misaligned, with decrease in interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression and increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated increase in CD16 monocyte expression. Cells were cultured under differential conditions to generate M1/M2 macrophages. In the macrophages, opioid secretory capacity was shown to be diminished. Finally, Dragon (repulsive guidance molecule b, RGMb) expression was shown diminished in M1 macrophages, which serves as a key transcriptional inhibitor of IL-6 expression. These biochemical and cellular alterations in chronic low back pain can serve as potential biomarkers for assessing disease initiation, intensity and progression.

N2  - Purpose: To clarify the significance of Modic changes, bony endplate lesions, and disc degeneration as predictors of chronic low back pain (LBP) during 1-year follow-up. Methods: 49 patients with severe, non-specific, chronic LBP, and Modic 1 lesion (M1) were prospectively studied with MRI and questionnaire. Changes in grade of disc degeneration, severity of Modic changes, Schmorl lesions, and bony endplate irregularities were evaluated and changes assessed in LBP intensity on numeric rating scale 0–10 and severity with Oswestry disability index 0–100 (ODI). Association between change in MRI findings and symptoms was computed using generalized estimating equations analysis. Results: Although pain decreased in most patients during 1-year follow-up, it increased or persisted in 36 %. Change in M1, M2, bony endplate lesions, and signal intensity (SI) and height of the disc associated with change of pain intensity, while change in M1, bony endplate lesions, and disc height associated with change of ODI. Not only persistent M1s, increasing bony endplate lesions, decreasing disc height, and M2s, but also new M2s predicted persistence of pain, while decrease of M1s and SI of the disc and increase of size of M2s predicted decrease of pain. Changes in disc bulges did not associate with pain. Conclusions: In patients with chronic non-specific LBP, persisting M1, decreasing disc height, and increasing bony endplate lesions associated with persisting pain while decrease of SI of the disc with decrease of pain. Such changing MRI findings in the same disc space have earlier been shown to progress abnormally fast. They may be signs or biomarkers of a prolonged pain causing, deforming degenerative process, and should lead to considering early intervention or specific treatments to affect that process.

N2  - Chronic musculoskeletal pain condition often shows poor correlations between tissue abnormalities and clinical pain. Therefore, classification of pain conditions like chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia depends mostly on self report and less on objective findings like X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes. However, recent advances in structural and functional brain imaging have identified brain abnormalities in chronic pain conditions that can be used for illness classification. Because the analysis of complex and multivariate brain imaging data is challenging, machine learning techniques have been increasingly utilized for this purpose. The goal of machine learning is to train specific classifiers to best identify variables of interest on brain MRIs (i.e., biomarkers). This report describes classification techniques capable of separating MRI-based brain biomarkers of chronic pain patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (70–92%) using machine learning, as well as critical scientific, practical, and ethical considerations related to their potential clinical application. Although self-report remains the gold standard for pain assessment, machine learning may aid in the classification of chronic pain disorders like chronic back pain and fibromyalgia as well as provide mechanistic information regarding their neural correlates.

N2  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The true understanding of aging and disc degeneration (DD) is still elusive. MRI has not helped our attempts to understand the health and disease status of the discs as it reflects mainly the end morphologic changes and not the changes at a molecular level. Understanding degeneration at a molecular level through proteomics might allow differentiation from normal aging and also aid in the development of biomarkers for early diagnosis and preventive therapies. PURPOSE: To utilize proteomics to understand the molecular basis of healthy, aging, and degenerating discs and conclusively differentiate normal aging and degeneration. STUDY DESIGN: Proteomic analysis of human intervertebral disc samples. METHODS: L4–L5 disc samples from three groups were acquired and subjected to proteomic analysis. Samples from individuals aged in the second, third, and fourth decades were used to represent young healthy discs (Group A). Those from MRI normal donors aged in the fifth, sixth, and seventh decades represented normal aging (Group B). Five degenerated discs obtained from patients at surgery represented degeneration (Group C). The entire proteome map and alteration in protein expressions were further analyzed using bioinformatics analysis. This was a self-funded project. RESULTS: There were 84 common proteins. Specific proteins numbered 225 in A, 315 in B, and 283 in C. By gene ontology biological process identification, Group A predominated with extracellular matrix organization, cytoskeletal structural and normal metabolic proteins. Group B differed in having additional basal expression of immune response, complement inhibitors, and senescence proteins. Group C was different, with upregulation of proteins associated with oxidative stress response, positive regulators of apoptosis, innate immune response, complement activation and defense response to gram positive bacteria indicating ongoing inflammaging. CONCLUSIONS: Our study documented diverse proteome signatures between the young, aging and degenerating discs. Inflammaging was the main differentiator between normal biological aging and DD. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Multiple inflammatory molecules unique to DD were identified, allowing the possibility of developing specific biomarkers for early diagnosis and thereby provide evidence-based metrics for preventive measures rather than surgical intervention and also to monitor progress of the disease.

N2  - The mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain remain unclear. Here, we sought to characterize the transcriptome associated with chronic low back pain as well as the transcriptome of the transition from acute to chronic low back pain. For the analysis, we compared the whole blood transcriptome of: (a) patients at the onset of low back pain who no longer had pain within 6 weeks after onset (acute) with patients who developed chronic low back pain at 6 months (chronic T5); and, (b) patients at the onset of low back pain (chronic T1) who developed chronic pain at 6 months with healthy pain-free (normal) controls. The majority of differentially expressed genes were protein coding. We illustrate a unique chronic low back pain transcriptome characterized by significant enrichment for known pain genes, extracellular matrix genes, and genes from the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genomic locus. The transcriptome of the transition from acute to chronic low back pain was characterized by significant upregulation of antigen presentation pathway (MHC class I and II) genes and downregulation of mitochondrial genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting a unique genomic signature of vulnerability to low back pain chronicity.

N2  - • Molecular intervertebral disc damage was associated with LBP and radiculopathy. • Patients with radiculopathy and LBP demonstrated a depletion of gagCEST values compared with healthy controls. • GagCEST imaging may be a non-invasive tool for investigation of degeneration processes of lumbar intervertebral discs (IVDs). GagCEST imaging may be an imaging biomarker for biochemical IVD alterations.

N2  - We aimed to compare serum biomarkers of inflammation, redox status and cartilage degradation between chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients with and without Modic 1 changes. We used a convenience sample of patients recruited from a single center, case-control study, conducted in a tertiary care center. From December, 2014 to May, 2016, 2,292 patients were consecutively screened, 34 met inclusion criteria and were prospectively enrolled in the present study. Cases (n = 13) were defined as patients with Modic 1 changes detected on MRI and controls (n = 21) as cLBP patients without (Modic 0). To assess serum biomarkers of inflammation, redox status and cartilage degradation, fasting serum samples were collected in a standardized manner and analyzed by immunoassays and spectrophotometry. Mean (95% CI) age was 44.1 (40.0–48.1) years and mean LBP duration was 72.5 (53.0–91.9) months. Serum biomarkers of inflammation (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α), redox status (total thiols, advanced oxidation protein products and carbonyl groups) and cartilage degradation (Coll2-1 and Coll2-1NO2) did not differ between cLBP patients with and without Modic 1 changes. In summary, we did not find any differences in serum biomarkers between cLBP patients with and without Modic 1 changes. Interpretation is limited by convenience sampling and small sample size.

N2  - The purpose of this work is to determine the relationship between biomarkers of inflammation, structure, and pain with radiographic disc space narrowing (DSN) in community-based participants. A total of 74 participants (37 cases and 37 controls) enrolled in the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project during 2006–2010 were selected. The cases had at least mild radiographic DSN and low back pain (LBP). The controls had neither radiographic evidence of DSN nor LBP. The measured analytes from human serum included N-cadherin, Keratin-19, Lumican, CXCL6, RANTES, IL-17, IL-6, BDNF, OPG, and NPY. A standard dolorimeter measured pressure-pain threshold. The coefficients of variation were used to evaluate inter- and intra-assay reliability. Participants with similar biomarker profiles were grouped together using cluster analysis. The binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in propensity score-matched models. Significant associations were found between radiographic DSN and OPG (RR = 3.90; 95% CI: 1.83, 8.31), IL-6 (RR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.92, 3.36), and NPY (RR = 2.06 95% CI: 1.62, 2.63). Relative to a cluster with low levels of biomarkers, a cluster representing elevated levels of OPG, RANTES, Lumican, Keratin-19, and NPY (RR = 3.04; 95% CI: 1.22, 7.54) and a cluster representing elevated levels of NPY (RR = 2.91; 95% CI: 1.15, 7.39) were significantly associated with radiographic DSN. Clinical Significance: These findings suggest that individual and combinations of biochemical biomarkers may reflect radiographic DSN. This is just one step toward understanding the relationships between biochemical biomarkers and DSN that may lead to improved intervention delivery. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

N2  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: About 85% of the patients with low back pain seeking medical care have nonspecific low back pain (NsLBP), implying that no definitive cause can be identified. Nonspecific low back pain is defined as low back pain and disability which cannot be linked to an underlying pathology, such as cancer, spinal osteomyelitis, fracture, spinal stenosis, cauda equine, ankylosing spondylitis, and visceral-referred pain. Many pain conditions are linked with elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers. Outcomes of interest are NsLBP and the level of pro-inflammatory biomarkers. PURPOSE: To unravel the etiology and get better insight in the prognosis of NsLBP, the aim of this study was to assess the association between pro-inflammatory biomarkers and the presence and severity of NsLBP. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic literature search was made in Embase, Medline, Cinahl, Webof-science, and Google scholar up to January 19th 2017. METHODS: Included were cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting on patients aged over 18 years with NsLBP, in which one or more pro-inflammatory biomarkers were measured in blood plasma. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. A best-evidence synthesis was used to summarize the results from the individual studies, meaning that the included studies were ranked according to the consistency of the findings and according to their methodological quality score using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Included were 10 studies which assessed four different pro-inflammatory biomarkers. For the association between the presence of NsLBP and C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α limited, conflicting and moderate evidence, respectively, was found. For the association between the severity of NsLBP and CRP and IL-6, moderate evidence was found. For the association between the severity of NsLBP and TNF-α and RANTES Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted conflicting and limited evidence, respectively, was found. CONCLUSIONS: This study found moderate evidence for (i) a positive association between the pro-inflammatory biomarkers CRP and IL-6 and the severity of NsLBP, and (ii) a positive association between TNF-α and the presence of NsLBP. Conflicting and limited evidence was found for the association between TNF-α and Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted and severity of NsLBP, respectively.

N2  - Biomarkers are biological characteristics that can be used to indicate health or disease. This paper reviews studies on biomarkers of low back pain (LBP) in human subjects. LBP is the leading cause of disability, caused by various spine-related disorders, including intervertebral disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and facet arthritis. The focus of these studies is inflammatory mediators, because inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of disc degeneration and associated pain mechanisms. Increasingly, studies suggest that the presence of inflammatory mediators can be measured systemically in the blood. These biomarkers may serve as novel tools for directing patient care. Currently, patient response to treatment is unpredictable with a significant rate of recurrence, and, while surgical treatments may provide anatomical correction and pain relief, they are invasive and costly. The review covers studies performed on populations with specific diagnoses and undefined origins of LBP. Since the natural history of LBP is progressive, the temporal nature of studies is categorized by duration of symptomology/disease. Related studies on changes in biomarkers with treatment are also reviewed. Ultimately, diagnostic biomarkers of LBP and spinal degeneration have the potential to shepherd an era of individualized spine medicine for personalized therapeutics in the treatment of LBP.

N2  - Biomarkers are biological characteristics that can be used to indicate health or disease. This paper reviews studies on biomarkers of low back pain (LBP) in human subjects. LBP is the leading cause of disability, caused by various spine-related disorders, including intervertebral disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and facet arthritis. The focus of these studies is inflammatory mediators, because inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of disc degeneration and associated pain mechanisms. Increasingly, studies suggest that the presence of inflammatory mediators can be measured systemically in the blood. These biomarkers may serve as novel tools for directing patient care. Currently, patient response to treatment is unpredictable with a significant rate of recurrence, and, while surgical treatments may provide anatomical correction and pain relief, they are invasive and costly. The review covers studies performed on populations with specific diagnoses and undefined origins of LBP. Since the natural history of LBP is progressive, the temporal nature of studies is categorized by duration of symptomology/disease. Related studies on changes in biomarkers with treatment are also reviewed. Ultimately, diagnostic biomarkers of LBP and spinal degeneration have the potential to shepherd an era of individualized spine medicine for personalized therapeutics in the treatment of LBP.

N2  - Uncertainty is the ubiquitous presence across health care. It is usually understood in terms of decision making, 'knowing' the correct diagnosis or understanding how the human body works. Using the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Georges Canguilhem and Tim Ingold, I outline a story of journeying and habitation, and argue that while uncertainty for practitioners may be about enhancing theoretical knowledge, for patients it is about knowing how to act in a taken-for-granted and largely unconscious way in a world that has become uncertain, and in which the main tool of action, the human body, no longer functions with the certainty it once had. In this situation, the role of the practitioner is first and foremost to recognize the uncertainty that has emerged in the patient's 'habitation' and to reassure them by enabling them to have a new or restored confidence in their body so that they can act with certainty.

N2  - Background: There is paucity in the literature regarding the role of interoceptive accuracy (IAc) at predicting the effectiveness of osteopathic techniques which increase spinal mobility when directed specifically at the thoracolumbar junction (TLJ). Aims: The study aimed to explore whether a high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust of the TLJ would increase spinal mobility (measured through Range of Motion; ROM) and change IAc. Also, whether baseline IAc correlated with the post-ROM measures and change in ROM. Method: 21 asymptomatic participants were allocated into three conditions in a randomised order. These were; (1) a high velocity low amplitude manipulation of the TLJ; (2) sham (basic touch); and (3) a control (laying supine on a plinth). Before and following each intervention, the participants’ spinal ROM was measured using an Acumar digital inclinometer. In addition to this an ECG was used to measure their pre and post condition IAc. Results: There were significant increases in ROM for all condition, however, the HVLA thrust led to a significantly greater increase in ROM (p < 0.001) when compared to the control and sham. Baseline IAc was inversely associated with post-ROM but there was no association with change in ROM. The HVLA thrust did not significantly change IAc scores from pre to post intervention. Conclusions. HVLA thrust over the TLJ is a useful intervention for increasing spinal ROM. IAc maybe a useful predictor for intervention effectiveness of this technique and spinal area which could in the future be utilised by osteopaths as part of their diagnostics.

N2  - Background: Myofascial release (MFR) is used to restore tissue extensibility of the fascia tissue and is considered to be useful in a number of clinical settings such as low back pain, ankle injuries, fibromyalgia, and headaches. There is, however, despite the popularity of MFR in manual therapy, little consensus on whether it leads to biomechanical, systemic or interoceptive outcomes. Aims: This study aimed to explore the immediate biomechanical (increased elasticity for increased range of motion), systemic (local vs. distal areas of pain threshold) and bodily awareness effects (interoception) of a myofascial release technique on the thoracic spine. Method: Twelve healthy participants took part in this triple-bind, repeated measures, cross-over design study, and were randomised into counterbalanced sequences of three conditions; a control, a sham, and the MFR condition. The outcome measures used were; range of motion (ROM), pain pressure thresholds (PPT), and interoceptive sensitivity (IS) to assess biomechanical, systemic, and interoceptive effects of MFR. Results: There were significant increases in ROM and PPT (both local and distal) post MFR intervention. There was also a positive correlation between baseline interoceptive sensitivity and post-MFR ROM and a negative correlation for baseline interoceptive sensitivity and post-MRF PPT. Interoceptive sensitivity did increase post-MFR but this was non-significant. Conclusions: The increase in ROM suggests that the MFR may have caused a biomechanical change in tissue elasticity creating an increase in tissue flexibility. The increase in both local and distal sites of the PPT suggest an overall systemic response to the therapy. The correlation between baseline IS and post-MFR ROM and PPT suggest that IS may be usefully applied as a predictor for ROM and PPT post-MFR.

N2  - Background: Intervertebral motion impairment is widely thought to be related to chronic back disability, however, the movements of inter-vertebral pairs are not independent of each other and motion may also be related to morphology. Furthermore, maximum intervertebral range of motion (IV-RoMmax) is difficult to measure accurately in living subjects. The purpose of this study was to explore possible relationships between (IV-RoMmax) and lordosis, initial attainment rate and IV-RoMmax at other levels during weight-bearing flexion using quantitative fluoroscopy (QF). Methods: Continuous QF motion sequences were recorded during controlled active sagittal flexion of 60° in 18 males (mean age 27.6 SD 4.4) with no history of low back pain in the previous year. IV-RoMmax, lordotic angle, and initial attainment rate at all inter-vertebral levels from L2-S1 were extracted. Relationships between IV-RoMmax and the other variables were explored using correlation coefficients, and simple linear regression was used to determine the effects of any significant relationships. Within and between observer repeatability of IV-RoMmax and initial attainment rate measurements were assessed in a subset of ten participants, using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM).

N2  - The purpose of the present case study was to explore the efficacy of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in patient with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in the critical care outpatient department. Here, we present a 48-year-old male case with breathlessness, increased frequency of defecation, and pain in and around the nape of neck with diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis. He scored 3 on a patient-reported modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale. Osteopathic examination reveals multiple somatic findings across the chest and abdominal region and treated by OMT. Pre- and post-intervention changes were assessed by the 13-item shortness of breath with daily activities (13iSOBDA). 27.2, 22, 16.4, and 11.8 were noted at the end of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th week of intervention, respectively, on 13iSOBDA while mMRC decreased from 3 to 1. OMT may be a feasible option in decreasing the symptoms of the PPF in the critical care outpatient department.

N2  - BACKGROUND In 2010, the World Health Organization published benchmarks for training in osteopathy in which osteopathic visceral techniques are included. The purpose of this study was to identify and critically appraise the scientific literature concerning the reliability of diagnosis and the clinical efficacy of techniques used in visceral osteopathy. METHODS Databases MEDLINE, OSTMED.DR, the Cochrane Library, Osteopathic Research Web, Google Scholar, Journal of American Osteopathic Association (JAOA) website, International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine (IJOM) website, and the catalog of Académie d'ostéopathie de France website were searched through December 2017. Only inter-rater reliability studies including at least two raters or the intra-rater reliability studies including at least two assessments by the same rater were included. For efficacy studies, only randomized-controlled-trials (RCT) or crossover studies on unhealthy subjects (any condition, duration and outcome) were included. Risk of bias was determined using a modified version of the quality appraisal tool for studies of diagnostic reliability (QAREL) in reliability studies. For the efficacy studies, the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess their methodological design. Two authors performed data extraction and analysis. RESULTS Eight reliability studies and six efficacy studies were included. The analysis of reliability studies shows that the diagnostic techniques used in visceral osteopathy are unreliable. Regarding efficacy studies, the least biased study shows no significant difference for the main outcome. The main risks of bias found in the included studies were due to the absence of blinding of the examiners, an unsuitable statistical method or an absence of primary study outcome. CONCLUSIONS The results of the systematic review lead us to conclude that well-conducted and sound evidence on the reliability and the efficacy of techniques in visceral osteopathy is absent. TRIAL REGISTRATION The review is registered PROSPERO 12th of December 2016. Registration number is CRD4201605286 .

N2  - OBJECTIVE Breast cancer patients often benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, a protocol whose effectiveness is accompanied by disabling adverse effects. The aim of this controlled clinical study was to determine the impact of visceral osteopathy on the incidence of nausea/vomiting, constipation and overall quality of life (QoL) in women operated for breast cancer and undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy in Centre Georges François Leclerc, CGFL. STUDY DESIGN Ninety-four women operated for a breast cancer stage 1-3, in complete resection and to whom a 3 FEC 100 chemotherapy was prescribed, were randomly allocated to experimental or placebo group. Experimental group underwent a visceral osteopathic technique and placebo group was subjected to a superficial manipulation after each chemotherapy cycle. Rate of grade ≥1 nausea/vomiting or constipation, on the first 3 cycles of FEC 100, were reported. QoL was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. RESULTS Rate of nausea/vomiting episodes of grade ≥1 was high in both experimental and placebo group. Constipation episodes of grade ≥1 were also frequent. No significant differences were found between the two groups concerning the rate of nausea/vomiting (p = 0.569) or constipation (p = 0.204) according to clinician reported side-effects but patient reported impact of constipation and diarrhoea on quality of life was significantly lower in experimental group (p = 0.036 and p = 0.038, respectively). CONCLUSION Osteopathy does not reduce the incidence of nausea/vomiting in women operated for breast cancer and undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, patient reported digestive quality of life was significantly ameliorated by osteopathy. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02840890.

N2  - Background One-size-fits-all interventions reduce chronic low back pain (CLBP) a small amount. An individualised intervention called cognitive functional therapy (CFT) was superior for CLBP compared with manual therapy and exercise in one randomised controlled trial (RCT). However, systematic reviews show group interventions are as effective as one-to-one interventions for musculoskeletal pain. This RCT investigated whether a physiotherapist-delivered individualised intervention (CFT) was more effective than physiotherapist-delivered group-based exercise and education for individuals with CLBP.

Methods 206 adults with CLBP were randomised to either CFT (n=106) or group-based exercise and education (n=100). The length of the CFT intervention varied according to the clinical progression of participants (mean=5 treatments). The group intervention consisted of up to 6 classes (mean=4 classes) over 6–8 weeks. Primary outcomes were disability and pain intensity in the past week at 6 months and 12months postrandomisation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat using linear mixed models.

Results CFT reduced disability more than the group intervention at 6 months (mean difference, 8.65; 95% CI 3.66 to 13.64; p=0.001), and at 12 months (mean difference, 7.02; 95% CI 2.24 to 11.80; p=0.004). There were no between-group differences observed in pain intensity at 6 months (mean difference, 0.76; 95% CI -0.02 to 1.54; p=0.056) or 12 months (mean difference, 0.65; 95% CI -0.20 to 1.50; p=0.134).

Conclusion CFT reduced disability, but not pain, at 6 and 12 months compared with the group-based exercise and education intervention. Future research should examine whether the greater reduction in disability achieved by CFT renders worthwhile differences for health systems and patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010. OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatments in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (20 February 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012), AMED (January 1985 to February 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to February 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to Feburary 2012), PEDro (January 1980 to February 2012), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The authors extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality independently. They contacted trial investigators for missing information. MAIN RESULTS We identified six RCTs (430 participants), with moderate quality evidence, for inclusion in the review. When the searches were updated in 2012 we found no further studies. The sequence generation was not adequate in one study and not described in two studies. We performed two meta-analyses to evaluate the clinical (three trials, 261 participants included) and neurophysiological (two trials, 101 participants included) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition.We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI -0.94 to 3.87). In the simple decompression group 91 out 131 patients clinically improved; in the transposition group 97 out 130 patients improved. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85).In one trial (47 participants) the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in the clinical and neurophysiological outcomes.One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. The authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to the information did not produce further improvement. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The available evidence is not sufficient to identify the best treatment for idiopathic ulnar neuropathy at the elbow on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a patient conservatively or surgically. However, the results of our meta-analysis suggest that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, including when the nerve impairment is severe. In mild cases, evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.

N2  - Objective: To present the clinical diagnostic features including management of Guyon canal syndrome in a case with unresolved sensory deficits in a young female cyclist. Clinical Presentation: After 14 days of cycling across Canada, a 23-year old female experienced sensory loss, followed by atrophy and a "claw" hand appearance of her left hand. Intervention and Outcome: Treatment included cervical chiropractic manipulation, soft tissue therapy and the use of cycling gloves. Seven years after the initial injury a lack of sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution of her left hand has persisted. Discussion: This case demonstrates that a lack of proper management can lead to permanent sensory loss and is worth highlighting. Various therapists evaluated the patient's symptoms and provided minimal care. No diagnosis was given, nor were appropriate measures taken for her to understand the risks of continuing to ride. Summary: Although treatment for Guyon Canal Syndrome can be as easy as cessation from cycling until symptoms subside, other treatment options could be Objectif : Présenter les caractéristiques de diagnostic clinique, dont le traitement du syndrome du canal de Guyon dans un cas de déficits sensoriels non traités chez une jeune cycliste. Tableau clinique : Après 14 jours de vélo à travers le Canada, une femme de 23 ans a souffert une perte sensorielle, suivie par une atrophie et l'aspect d'une « main en griffe » à sa main gauche. Intervention et résultats : Le traitement comportait la manipulation chiropratique cervicale, le traitement des tissus mous et le port de gants de vélo. Sept ans après la blessure initiale, un manque de sensation dans la distribution du nerf cubital de la main gauche a persisté. Discussion : Ce cas démontre que le manque de traitement approprié peut entraîner la perte sensorielle permanente et mérite qu'on s'y attarde. Différents thérapeutes ont évalué les symptômes de la patiente et lui ont fourni des soins minimaux. Aucun diagnostic n'a été fait, ni des mesures appropriées n'étaient prises pour lui faire comprendre les risques de continuer à faire du vélo.

N2  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been shown to be one of the tools that can measure oxygenation in muscle and other tissues in vivo. This review paper highlights the progress, specifically in this decade, that has been made for evaluating skeletal muscle oxygenation and oxidative energy metabolism in sport, health and clinical sciences. Development of NIRS technologies has focused on improving quantification of the signal using multiple wavelengths to solve for absorption and scattering coefficients, multiple pathlengths to correct for the influence of superficial skin and fat, and time-resolved and phase-modulated light sources to determine optical pathlengths. In addition, advances in optical imaging with multiple source and detector pairs as well as portability using small wireless detectors have expanded the usefulness of the devices. NIRS measurements have provided information on oxidative metabolism in various athletes during localized exercise and whole-body exercise, as well as training-induced adaptations. Furthermore, NIRS technology has been used in the study of a number of chronic health conditions. Future developments of NIRS technology will include enhancing signal quantification. In addition, advances in NIRS imaging and portability promise to transform how measurements of oxygen utilization are obtained in the future. This journal is © 2011 The Royal Society.

N2  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has become an increasingly valuable tool to monitor tissue oxygenation (Toxy) in vivo. Observations of changes in the absorption of light with Toxy have been recognized as early as 1876, leading to a milestone NIRS paper by Jöbsis in 1977. Changes in the absorption and scatting of light in the 700–850-nm range has been successfully used to evaluate Toxy. The most practical devices use continuous-wave light providing relative values of Toxy. Phase-modulated or pulsed light can monitor both absorption and scattering providing more accurate signals. NIRS provides excellent time resolution (~ 10 Hz), and multiple source–detector pairs can be used to provide low-resolution imaging. NIRS has been applied to a wide range of populations. Continued development of NIRS devices in terms of lower cost, better detection of both absorption and scattering, and smaller size will lead to a promising future for NIRS studies.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to assess if chronic low back pain patients have impaired paraspinal muscle O2 turnover and endurance capacity as compared to healthy control subjects during dynamic exercise. Middle-aged healthy male subjects (n = 12, control) and male patients with chronic low back pain (n = 17, CLBP) participated in the study. L4-L5 level paraspinal muscle fatigue was objectively assessed during earlier validated 90 s dynamic back endurance test (spectral EMG, MPFslope). Also EMG amplitude (EMG amplitude) and initial MPF (MPFinitial) were assessed from the initial 5 s of the endurance contraction. Simultaneously near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used for quantitative measurement of local L4-L5 paraspinal muscle O2 consumption. Subcutaneous tissue thickness (ATT) was measured from the EMG and NIRS recording sites. The results indicated that control and CLBP groups were compatible as regarding anthropometric variables, paraspinal muscle activation levels (EMGamplitude), initial MPF (MPFinitial) and ATT. When the ATT was used as a covariate in the ANOVA analysis, CLBP group did not show significantly greater paraspinal muscle fatigability (right MPFslope - 12.2 ± 10.7%/min, left right MPFslope - 12.6 ± 13.3%/min) or O2 consumption (right NIRSslope - 52.8 ± 79.6 μM/l/s) as compared to healthy controls (right MPFslope - 11.9 ± 7.6%/min, left MPFslope - 12.7 ± 8.6%/min, right NIRSslope - 53.7 ± 95.2 μM/l/s). As a conclusion, these CLBP male patients did not show any impaired rate of paraspinal muscle oxygen consumption or excessive paraspinal muscle fatigability during dynamic exercise as compared with healthy controls. Subcutaneous tissue thickness has a strong influence on the NIRS and EMG amplitude measurements and, if unchecked, it could result in the false interpretation of the results. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Biering-Sørenson (1984) found that individuals with less lumbar extensor muscle endurance had an increased occurrence of first episode low back pain. As a result, back endurance tests have been recommended for inclusion in health assessment protocols. However, different studies have reported markedly different values for endurance times, leading some researchers to believe that the back is receiving support from the biceps femoris and gluteus maximus. Therefore, this study was designed to examine the haemodynamic and neuromuscular activity of the erector spinae, biceps femoris, and gluteus maximus musculature during the Biering-Sørenson Muscular Endurance Test (BSME). Methods: Seventeen healthy individuals and 46 individuals with chronic low back pain performed the Biering-Sørenson Muscular Endurance Test while surface electromyography was used to quantify neuromuscular activity. Disposable silver-silver-chloride electrodes were placed in a bipolar arrangement over the right or left biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, and the lumbosacral paraspinal muscles at the level of L3. Near Infrared Spectroscopy was used simultaneously to measure tissue oxygenation and blood volume changes of the erector spinae and biceps femoris. Results: The healthy group displayed a significantly longer time to fatigue (Healthy: 168.5s, LBP: 111.1s; p ≤ 0.05). Significant differences were shown in the median frequency slope of the erector spinae between the two groups at 90-100% of the time to fatigue while no significant differences were noted in the haemodynamic data for the two groups. Conclusion: Although the BSME has been recognized as a test for back endurance, individuals with chronic LBP appear to incorporate a strategy that may help support the back musculature by utilizing the biceps femoris and gluteus maximus to a greater degree than their healthy counterparts. © 2006 McKeon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was initiated in 1977 by Jobsis as a simple, noninvasive method for measuring the presence of oxygen in muscle and other tissues in vivo. This review honoring Jobsis highlights the progress that has been made in developing and adapting NIRS and NIR imaging (NIRI) technologies for evaluating skeletal muscle O2 dynamics and oxidative energy metabolism. Development of NIRS/NIRI technologies has included novel approaches to quantification of the signal, as well as the addition of multiple source detector pairs for imaging. Adaptation of NIRS technology has focused on the validity and reliability of NIRS measurements. NIRS measurements have been extended to resting, ischemic, localized exercise, and whole body exercise conditions. In addition, NIRS technology has been applied to the study of a number of chronic health conditions, including patients with chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, varying muscle diseases, spinal cord injury, and renal failure. As NIRS technology continues to evolve, the study of skeletal muscle function with NIRS first illuminated by Jobsis continues to be bright. © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

N2  - Despite an elusive pathophysiology, common characteristics are often observed in individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP). These include psychological symptoms, altered pain perception, altered pain modulation and altered muscle activation. These factors have been explored as possible determinants of disability, either separately or in cross-sectional studies, but were never assessed in a single longitudinal study. Therefore, the objective was to determine the relative contribution of psychological and neurophysiological factors to future disability in individuals with past LBP. The study included two experimental sessions (baseline and six months later) to assess cutaneous heat pain and pain tolerance thresholds, pain inhibition, as well as trunk muscle activation. Both sessions included the completion of validated questionnaires to determine clinical pain, disability, pain catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs and pain vigilance. One hundred workers with a history of LBP and 19 healthy individuals took part in the first experimental session. The second experimental session was exclusively conducted on workers with a history of LBP (77/100). Correlation analyses between initial measures and disability at six months were conducted, and measures significantly associated with disability were used in multiple regression analyses. A first regression analysis showed that psychological symptoms contributed unique variance to future disability (R2 = 0.093, p = .009). To control for the fluctuating nature of LBP, a hierarchical regression was conducted while controlling for clinical pain at six months (R2 = 0.213, p < .001) where pain inhibition contributed unique variance in the second step of the regression (R2 change = 0.094, p = .005). These results indicate that pain inhibition processes may constitute potential targets for treatment to alleviate future disability in individuals with past or present LBP. Then again, the link between psychological symptoms and pain inhibition needs to be clarified as both of these factors are linked together and influence disability in their own way.

N2  - Background: This study systematically summarizes quantitative imaging biomarker research in non-traumatic neck and shoulder musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). There were two research questions: 1) Are there quantitative imaging biomarkers associated with the presence of neck and shoulder MSDs?, 2) Are there quantitative imaging biomarkers associated with the severity of neck and shoulder MSDs? Methods: PubMed and SCOPUS were used for the literature search. One hundred and twenty-five studies met primary inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from 49 sufficient quality studies. Results: Most of the 125 studies were cross-sectional and utilized convenience samples of patients as both cases and controls. Only half controlled for potential confounders via exclusion or in the analysis. Approximately one-third reported response rates. In sufficient quality articles, 82% demonstrated at least one statistically significant association between the MSD(s) and biomarker(s) studied. The literature synthesis suggested that neck muscle size may be decreased in neck pain, and trapezius myalgia and neck/shoulder pain may be associated with reduced vascularity in the trapezius and reduced trapezius oxygen saturation at rest and in response to upper extremity tasks. Reduced vascularity in the supraspinatus tendon may also be a feature in rotator cuff tears. Five of eight studies showed an association between a quantitative imaging marker and MSD severity. Conclusions: Although research on quantitative imaging biomarkers is still in a nascent stage, some MSD biomarkers were identified. There are limitations in the articles examined, including possible selection bias and inattention to potentially confounding factors. Recommendations for future studies are provided.

N2  - Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the greatest contributors to disability in the world and there is growing interest on the role of biomarkers in LBP. To purpose of this review was to analyze available evidence on the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers, clinical presentation, and outcomes in patients with acute, subacute and chronic non-specific low back pain (NSLBP). Methods: A search was performed in Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Amed databases. Studies which measured levels of inflammatory biomarkers in participants with NSLBP were included. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, full-texts, and extracted data from included studies. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Level of evidence was assessed using the modified GRADE approach for prognostic studies. Results: Seven primary studies were included in this review. All results assessed using the modified GRADE demonstrated low to very low quality evidence given the small number of studies and small sample. Three studies examined C-reactive protein (CRP), one of which found significantly higher CRP levels in an acute NSLBP group than in controls and an association between high pain intensity and elevated CRP. Three studies examined tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), two of which found elevated TNF-α in chronic NSLBP participants compared to controls. Two studies examined interleukin 6 (IL-6), none of which found a significant difference in IL-6 levels between NSLBP groups and controls. Two studies examined interleukin 1 beta (IL-β), none of which found a significant difference in IL-β levels between NSLBP groups and controls. Conclusions: This review found evidence of elevated CRP in individuals with acute NSLBP and elevated TNF-Α in individuals with chronic NSLBP. There are a limited number of high-quality studies evaluating similar patient groups and similar biomarkers, which limits the conclusion of this review.

N2  - There is increasing interest about the possible involvement of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in initiation and maintenance of chronic muscle pain syndromes of different aetiology. Epidemiological data show that stresses of different nature, e.g. work-related, psychosocial, etc., typically characterised by SNS activation, may be a co-factor in the development of the pain syndrome and/or negatively affect its time course. In spite of their clear traumatic origin, whiplash associated disorders (WAD) appear to share many common features with other chronic pain syndromes affecting the musculo-skeletal system. These features do not only include symptoms, like type of pain or sensory and motor dysfunctions, but possibly also some of the pathophysiological mechanisms that may concur to establish the chronic pain syndrome. This review focuses on WAD, particular emphasis being devoted to sensorimotor symptoms, and on the actions exerted by the sympathetic system at muscle level. Besides its well-known action on muscle blood flow, the SNS is able to affect the contractility of muscle fibres, to modulate the proprioceptive information arising from the muscle spindle receptors and, under certain conditions, to modulate nociceptive information. Furthermore, the activity of the SNS itself is in turn affected by muscle conditions, such as its current state of activity, fatigue and pain signals originating in the muscle. The possible involvement of the SNS in the development of WAD is discussed in light of the several positive feedback loops in which it is implicated. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Compression at myofascial trigger points (MTrPs), known as “ischemic compression,” has been reported to provide immediate relief of musculoskeletal pain and reduce the sympathetic activity that exacerbates chronic pain. We conducted a pilot study to investigate the possible involvement of the prefrontal cortex in pain relief obtained by MTrP compression in the present study, and analyzed the relationships among prefrontal hemodynamic activity, activity of the autonomic nervous system, and subjective pain in patients with chronic neck pain, with and without MTrP compression. Twenty-one female subjects with chronic neck pain were randomly assigned to two groups: MTrP compression (n = 11) or Non-MTrP compression (n = 10). Compression for 30 s was conducted 4 times. During the experiment, prefrontal hemodynamic activity [changes in Oxy-hemoglobin (Hb), Deoxy-Hb, and Total-Hb concentrations] and autonomic activity based on heart rate variability (HRV) were monitored by using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electrocardiography (ECG), respectively. The results indicated that MTrP compression significantly reduced subjective pain compared with Non-MTrP compression. The spectral frequency-domain analyses of HRV indicated that a low frequency (LF) component of HRV was decreased, and a high frequency (HF) component of HRV was increased during MTrP compression, while LF/HF ratio was decreased during MTrP compression. In addition, prefrontal hemodynamic activity was significantly decreased during MTrP compression compared with Non-MTrP compression. Furthermore, changes in autonomic activity were significantly correlated with changes in subjective pain and prefrontal hemodynamic activity. Along with previous studies indicating a role for sympathetic activity in the exacerbation of chronic pain, the present results suggest that MTrP compression in the neck region alters the activity of the autonomic nervous system via the prefrontal cortex to reduce subjective pain.

N2  - Continuous dynamic multi-segmental studies of lumbar motion have added depth to our understanding of the biomechanics of back pain, but few have attempted to continuously measure the proportions of motion accepted by individual levels. This study attempted to compare the motion contributions of adjacent lumbar levels during an active weight bearing flexion and return protocol in chronic, non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) patients and controls using quantitative fluoroscopy (QF). Eight CNSLBP patients received QF during guided standing lumbar flexion. Dynamic motion sharing of segments from L2 to S1 were calculated and analysed for interactions between levels. Eight asymptomatic controls were then matched to the 8 patients for age and sex and their motion sharing patterns compared. Share of intersegmental motion was found to be consistently highest at L2-L3 and L3-L4 and lowest at L5-S1 throughout the motion in both groups, with the exception of maximum flexion where L4-L5 received the greatest share. Change in motion sharing occurred throughout the flexion and return motion paths in both participant groups but tended to vary more at L4-L5 in patients (p < 0.05). In patients, L5-S1 provided less angular range (p < 0.05) and contributed less at maximum bend (p < 0.05), while L3-L4, on average over the bending sequence, provided a greater share of motion (p < 0.05). Intervertebral motion sharing inequality is therefore a normal feature during lumbar flexion. However, in patients, inequality was more pronounced, and variability of motion share at some levels increased. These effects may result from differences in muscular contraction or in the mechanical properties of the disc.

N2  - Background: Spinal manipulation for nonspecific neck pain is thought to work in part by improving inter-vertebral range of motion (IV-RoM), but it is difficult to measure this or determine whether it is related to clinical outcomes. Objectives: This study undertook to determine whether cervical spine flexion and extension IV-RoM increases after a course of spinal manipulation, to explore relationships between any IV-RoM increases and clinical outcomes and to compare palpation with objective measurement in the detection of hypo-mobile segments. Method: Thirty patients with nonspecific neck pain and 30 healthy controls matched for age and gender received quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) screenings to measure flexion and extension IV-RoM (C1-C6) at baseline and 4-week follow-up between September 2012-13. Patients received up to 12 neck manipulations and completed NRS, NDI and Euroqol 5D-5L at baseline, plus PGIC and satisfaction questionnaires at follow-up. IV-RoM accuracy, repeatability and hypo-mobility cut-offs were determined. Minimal detectable changes (MDC) over 4 weeks were calculated from controls. Patients and control IV-RoMs were compared at baseline as well as changes in patients over 4 weeks. Correlations between outcomes and the number of manipulations received and the agreement (Kappa) between palpated and QF-detected of hypo-mobile segments were calculated. Results: QF had high accuracy (worst RMS error 0.5o) and repeatability (highest SEM 1.1o, lowest ICC 0.90) for IV-RoM measurement. Hypo-mobility cut offs ranged from 0.8o to 3.5o. No outcome was significantly correlated with increased IV-RoM above MDC and there was no significant difference between the number of hypo-mobile segments in patients and controls at baseline or significant increases in IV-RoMs in patients. However, there was a modest and significant correlation between the number of manipulations received and the number of levels and directions whose IV-RoM increased beyond MDC (Rho=0.39, p=0.043). There was also no agreement between palpation and QF in identifying hypo-mobile segments (Kappa 0.04-0.06). Conclusions: This study found no differences in cervical sagittal IV-RoM between patients with non-specific neck pain and matched controls. There was a modest dose-response relationship between the number of manipulations given and number of levels increasing IV-RoM - providing evidence that neck manipulation has a mechanical effect at segmental levels. However, patient-reported outcomes were not related to this.

N2  - Background: Spinal manipulation for nonspecific neck pain is thought to work in part by improving inter-vertebral range of motion (IV-RoM), but it is difficult to measure this or determine whether it is related to clinical outcomes.

N2  - Objective To determine differences in biomarker levels between radiographic phenotypes of facet joint osteoarthritis (FOA) only, spine OA only ((disc space narrowing (DSN) and vertebral osteophytes (OST)) or the combination of FOA and spine OA. Design A cross-sectional analysis of data from 555 participants in the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project was performed. Lumbar spine levels were graded by severity (OST and DSN) and presence (FOA) of degeneration. Biomarkers included hyaluronan (HA) and type II collagen (CTX-II). Adjusted risk ratios (aRRR) were estimated using multinomial regression, with adjustment for age, race, sex, body mass index (BMI), and radiographic OA (knee, hip, hand). Interactions were tested between sex, race and low back symptoms. Results FOA only was present in 22.4%, 14.5% had spine OA only, and 34.6% had the combination of FOA and spine OA. Compared to the reference group of neither FOA or spine OA, a one unit higher ln HA level was associated with 31% higher relative risk ratio (RRR = 1.31 (95% 1.03, 1.67)) of having FOA only, while, a one unit higher lnuCTX-II level was associated with 84% higher relative risk ratio (RRR = 1.84 (95% CI 1.19, 2.84)) of having spine OA only. No significant interactions were identified. Conclusion Interestingly, OA affecting the synovial facet joint was associated with a marker of inflammation (HA). Spine OA, affecting intervertebral discs that contain collagen type II, was associated with a marker reflecting collagen type II degradation (CTX-II). These findings suggest that biomarkers may reflect the different pathophysiologic processes of lumbar spine OA phenotypes.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the effects of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) on autonomic nervous system (ANS)-mediated outcomes, in both symptomatic and healthy populations, and to assess the quality of evidence for the most prevalent outcomes with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched from their inception to March 2014. Randomized controlled trials involving SMT, such as mobilization and manipulation, that reported at least 1 outcome related to the ANS, with placebo, control groups, or other SMT techniques as comparators, with either healthy or symptomatic samples were included. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach were used to assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, respectively. Results: Eighteen trials were included in this systematic review. Passive accessory intervertebral mobilization produced sympathoexcitation independently of the treated region (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine); although sustained natural apophyseal glides did not influence the ANS, conflicting results were observed regarding manipulation techniques. The overall quality of evidence for all analyzed outcomes ranged from low to very low quality. Conclusion: There is evidence pointing toward the existence of sympathoexcitatory short-term effects following passive accessory intervertebral mobilization mobilizations, but not for sustained natural apophyseal glide mobilizations. There is conflicting evidence regarding the ability of manipulation to elicit sympathoexcitation. However, the low quality of the evidence precludes a definitive conclusion of such effects. Based on the current evidence, there is uncertainty regarding the true effect estimates of SMT on ANS-mediated outcomes.
