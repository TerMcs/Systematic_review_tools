  abstract = {{Study Design. Descriptive method guidelines. Objectives. To help reviewers design, conduct, and report reviews of trials in the field of back and neck pain. Summary of Background Data. In 1997, the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group published method guidelines for systematic reviews. Since its publication, new methodologic evidence emerged and more experience was acquired in conducting reviews. Methods. All reviews and protocols of the Back Review Group were assessed for compliance with the 1997 method guidelines. Also, the most recent version of the Cochrane Handbook (4.1) was checked for new recommendations. In addition, some important topics that were not addressed in the 1997 method guidelines were included (e.g., methods for qualitative analysis, reporting of conclusions, and discussion of clinical relevance of the results). In May 2002, preliminary results were presented and discussed in a workshop. In two rounds, a list of all possible recommendations and the final draft were circulated for comments among the editors of the Back Review Group. Results. The recommendations are divided in five categories\&colon; literature search, inclusion criteria, methodologic quality assessment, data extraction, and data analysis. Each recommendation is classified in minimum criteria and further guidance. Additional recommendations are included regarding assessment of clinical relevance, and reporting of results and conclusions. Conclusions. Systematic reviews need to be conducted as carefully as the trials they report and, to achieve full impact, systematic reviews need to meet high methodologic standards.}},

  abstract = {{Experimental and clinical studies suggested an analgesic effect on chronic pain by motor cortex activation. The present study explored the complex mechanisms of interaction between motor and pain during performing the slow and fast finger tapping task alone and in concomitant with nociceptive laser stimulation. The participants were 38 patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and 21 healthy subjects. We used a simultaneous multimodal method of laser-evoked potentials and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate metabolic and electrical changes during the finger tapping task and concomitant noxious laser stimulation. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a portable and optical method to detect cortical metabolic changes. Laser-evoked potentials are a suitable tool to study the nociceptive pathways function. We found a reduced tone of cortical motor areas in patients with FM compared to controls, especially during the fast finger tapping task. FM patients presented a slow motor performance in all the experimental conditions, requesting rapid movements. The amplitude of laser evoked potentials was different between patients and controls, in each experimental condition, as patients showed smaller evoked responses compared to controls. Concurrent phasic pain stimulation had a low effect on motor cortex metabolism in both groups nor motor activity changed laser evoked responses in a relevant way. There were no correlations between Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (FNIRS) and clinical features in FM patients. Our findings indicated that a low tone of motor cortex activation could be an intrinsic feature in FM and generate a scarce modulation on pain condition. A simple and repetitive movement such as that of the finger tapping task seems inefficacious in modulating cortical responses to pain both in patients and controls. The complex mechanisms of interaction between networks involved in pain control and motor function require further studies for the important role they play in structuring rehabilitation strategies.}},

This study will evaluate whether NSCLBP subgroups exhibit regional spinal kinematic differences, compared to healthy individuals, during functional tasks. Observational, cross-sectional study design. Spinal kinematics of 50 NSCLBP subjects (27 FP, 23 AEP) and 28 healthy individuals were investigated using 3D motion analysis (Vicon™) during functional tasks [reaching upwards, step down, step up, lifting, and replacing a box, stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, bending to retrieve (and returning from retrieving) a pen from the floor]. Mean sagittal angle for the total thoracic, total lumbar, upper thoracic, lower thoracic, upper lumbar, and lower lumbar regions between groups was compared. Significant differences were observed in lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions between NSCLBP subgroups during most tasks. Significant differences were observed between the FP and healthy group in the lower thoracic region during stand-to-sit-to-stand tasks and bending (and returning from) to retrieve a pen from the floor. All significant results demonstrated the FP group to operate in comparatively greater flexion. The thoraco-lumbar spine discriminated between FP and AEP, and FP and healthy groups during functional tasks. FP individuals demonstrated more kyphotic thoraco-lumbar postures, which may be pain provocative. No significant differences were observed between AEP and healthy groups, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may occur in AEP.}},

Specifically in chronic low back pain (CLBP), functional changes in the left primary motor cortex (M1) with impaired anticipatory postural activation (APA) of trunk muscles have been observed. Given the connections between frontal and M1 areas for motor planning, it is hypothesized that the pain side could differently influence M1 function and APA of paravertebral multifidus (MF) muscles. This study aimed at testing whether people with right- versus left-sided CLBP showed different M1 excitability and APA. Thirty-five individuals with lateralized CLBP (19 right-sided and 16 left-sided) and 13 pain-free subjects (normative values) were tested for the excitability of MF M1 area (active motor threshold—AMT) with transcranial magnetic stimulation and for the latency of MF APA during bilateral shoulder flexion and during unilateral hip extension in prone lying. In the right-sided CLBP group, the AMT of both M1 areas was lower than in the left-sided group and the pain-free subjects; the latency of MF APA was shorter in bilateral shoulder flexion and in the left hip extension tasks as compared to the left-sided group. In CLBP, an earlier MF APA was correlated with lower AMT in both tasks. People with right-sided CLBP presented with increased M1 excitability in both hemispheres and earlier MF APA. These results likely rely on cortical motor adaptation related to the tasks and axial muscles tested. Future studies should investigate whether CLBP side-related differences have a clinical impact, e.g. in diagnosis and intervention.}},

Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) has excellent repeatability and provides continuous standardised inter-vertebral kinematic data from fluoroscopic sequences allowing assessment of mid-range motion. The aim of this study was to determine whether proportional continuous IV rotational patterns were different in patients and controls. A secondary aim was to update the repeatability of QF measurement of range of motion (RoM) for inter-vertebral (IV) rotation. Fluoroscopic sequences were recorded of passive, recumbent coronal and sagittal motion, which was controlled for range and velocity. Segments L2–5 in 40 primary care CNSLBP patients and 40 matched controls were compared. Patients also completed the von Korff Chronic Pain Grade and Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire. Sequences were processed using automated image tracking algorithms to extract continuous inter-vertebral rotation data. These were converted to continuous proportional ranges of rotation (PR). The continuous proportional range variances were calculated for each direction and combined to produce a single variable representing their fluctuation (CPRV). Inter- and intra-rater repeatability were also calculated for the maximum IV-RoM measurements obtained during controlled trunk motion to provide an updated indication of the reliability and agreement of QF for measuring spine kinematics. CPRV was significantly higher in patients (0.011 vs. 0.008, Mann–Whitney two-sided p = 0.008), implying a mechanical subgroup. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found its sensitivity and specificity to be 0.78 \% (60–90) and 0.55 \% (37–73), respectively (area under the curve 0.672). CPRV was not correlated with pain severity or disability. The repeatability of maximum inter-vertebral range was excellent, but range was only significantly greater in patients at L4–5 in right side bending (p = 0.03). The variation in proportional motion between lumbar vertebrae during passive recumbent trunk motion was greater in patients with CNSLBP than in matched healthy controls, indicating that biomechanical factors in passive structures play a part.}},

  abstract = {{Limb movement imparts a perturbation to the body. The impact of that perturbation is limited via anticipatory postural adjustments. The strategy by which the CNS controls anticipatory postural adjustments of the trunk muscles during limb movement is altered during acute back pain and in people with recurrent back pain, even when they are pain free. The altered postural strategy probably serves to protect the spine in the short term, but it is associated with a cost and is thought to predispose spinal structures to injury in the long term. It is not known why this protective strategy might occur even when people are pain free, but one possibility is that it is caused by the anticipation of back pain. In eight healthy subjects, recordings of intramuscular EMG were made from the trunk muscles during single and repetitive arm movements. Anticipation of experimental back pain and anticipation of experimental elbow pain were elicited by the threat of painful cutaneous stimulation. There was no effect of anticipated experimental elbow pain on postural adjustments. During anticipated experimental back pain, for single arm movements there was delayed activation of the deep trunk muscles and augmentation of at least one superficial trunk muscle. For repetitive arm movements, there was decreased activity and a shift from biphasic to monophasic activation of the deep trunk muscles and increased activity of superficial trunk muscles during anticipation of back pain. In both instances, the changes were consistent with adoption of an altered strategy for postural control and were similar to those observed in patients with recurrent back pain. We conclude that anticipation of experimental back pain evokes a protective postural strategy that stiffens the spine. This protective strategy is associated with compressive cost and is thought to predispose to spinal injury if maintained long term.}},

Autism affects approximately 1\% of children in developing countries. Given this prevalence, identifying risk factors and therapeutic interventions are pressing objectives—objectives that rest on neurobiologically grounded and psychologically informed theories about the underlying pathophysiology. In this article, we review the evidence that autism could result from a dysfunctional oxytocin system early in life. As a mediator of successful procreation, not only in the reproductive system, but also in the brain, oxytocin plays a crucial role in sculpting socio-sexual behavior. Formulated within a (Bayesian) predictive coding framework, we propose that oxytocin encodes the saliency or precision of interoceptive signals and enables the neuronal plasticity necessary for acquiring a generative model of the emotional and social ‘self.’ An aberrant oxytocin system in infancy could therefore help explain the marked deficits in language and social communication – as well as the sensory, autonomic, motor, behavioral, and cognitive abnormalities – seen in autism.}},

We propose that studies evaluating treatment-based subgroups can be interpreted in the context of a three-stage process: (1) hypothesis generation–proposal of clinical features to define subgroups; (2) hypothesis testing–a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test that subgroup membership modifies the effect of a treatment; and (3) replication–another RCT to confirm the results of stage 2 and ensure that findings hold beyond the specific original conditions. At this point, the bulk of research evidence in defining subgroups of patients with low back pain is in the hypothesis generation stage; no classification system is supported by sufficient evidence to recommend implementation into clinical practice.}},

Spinal postural angles were measured with digital photographs. Psychosocial variables and physical activity were registered using questionnaires.

Risk factors for developing or sustaining LBP were calculated using logistic regression analysis.A more ankle-steered proprioceptive postural control strategy in upright standing increased the risk for developing or having recurrences of mild LBP within two years (Odds: 3.5; 95\% CI: 1.1–10.8; p<0.05).

Forty-five full-text research reports were assessed, of which 28 studies (six ankle injury, nine knee injury, and 13 low back pain studies) were included in the review. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality and the study design extracted for analysis including the participants, cognitive and physical tasks performed, as well as outcome measures (e.g., three-dimensional kinematics, center of pressure, etc.). All studies included were cross-sectional or case–control with methodological quality scores of 17.8 ± 2.2 out of a possible 22. Twenty-five of the 28 studies found changes in motor performance with dual-task conditions compared with single tasks. Furthermore, 54\% of studies reported a significant group by task interaction effect, reporting at least one alteration in injured groups’ motor performance under dual-task conditions when compared with an uninjured group. The results of this systematic review indicate that motor performance is further impaired by placing a cognitive load on individuals in populations with musculoskeletal injury. More demanding tasks such as gait appear to be more affected in injured individuals than simple balance tasks. Future investigators may want to consider the difficulty of the tasks included as well as the impact of dual-task paradigms on rehabilitation programs.}},

(2015) used a topical capsaicin/heat pain sensitization model to experimentally induce lower back pain, and demonstrated that the experimental pain experience caused a decrease in the muscular contribution to lumbar spine rotational stiffness (related to mechanical stability) as well as lower back local dynamic stability (LDS). It has yet to be established if pain elsewhere in the body, specifically in other regions of the spine, can similarly affect the stability of the lower back. The purpose of this investigation was therefore to quantify thoracic and lumbar spine LDS as well as the muscular contribution to lumbar spine rotational stiffness after an experimental neck pain protocol. Results demonstrated that LDS of the thoracic spine decreased in response to the capsaicin/heat induced neck pain. Limited adaptation was required at the lumbar spine as demonstrated by the lack of statistically significant changes in lower back LDS or rotational stiffness.}},

Adaptions of motor control occur in low back pain (LBP) while different motor adaption strategies exist across individuals, probably to reduce LBP and risk of injury. However, in some individuals with LBP, adapted motor control strategies might have long-term consequences, such as increased spinal loading that has been linked with degeneration of intervertebral discs and other tissues, potentially maintaining recurrent or chronic LBP. Factors contributing to motor control adaptations in LBP have been extensively studied on the motor output side, but less attention has been paid to changes in sensory input, specifically proprioception. Furthermore, motor cortex reorganization has been linked with chronic and recurrent LBP, but underlying factors are poorly understood. Here, we review current research on behavioral and neural effects of motor control adaptions in LBP. We conclude that back pain-induced disrupted or reduced proprioceptive signaling likely plays a pivotal role in driving long-term changes in the top-down control of the motor system via motor and sensory cortical reorganization. In the outlook of this review, we explore whether motor control adaptations are also important for other (musculoskeletal) pain conditions.}},

  abstract = {{Intervertebral motion impairment is widely thought to be related to chronic back disability, however, the movements of inter-vertebral pairs are not independent of each other and motion may also be related to morphology. Furthermore, maximum intervertebral range of motion (IV-RoMmax) is difficult to measure accurately in living subjects. The purpose of this study was to explore possible relationships between (IV-RoMmax) and lordosis, initial attainment rate and IV-RoMmax at other levels during weight-bearing flexion using quantitative fluoroscopy (QF). Continuous QF motion sequences were recorded during controlled active sagittal flexion of 60° in 18 males (mean age 27.6 SD 4.4) with no history of low back pain in the previous year. IV-RoMmax, lordotic angle, and initial attainment rate at all inter-vertebral levels from L2-S1 were extracted. Relationships between IV-RoMmax and the other variables were explored using correlation coefficients, and simple linear regression was used to determine the effects of any significant relationships. Within and between observer repeatability of IV-RoMmax and initial attainment rate measurements were assessed in a sub-set of ten participants, using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). QF measurements were highly repeatable, the lowest ICC for IV-RoMmax, being 0.94 (0.80–0.99) and highest SEM (0.76°). For initial attainment rate the lowest ICC was 0.84 (0.49–0.96) and the highest SEM (0.036). The results also demonstrated significant positive and negative correlations between IV-RoMmax and IV-RoMmax at other lumbar levels (r = −0.64–0.65), lordosis (r = −0.52–0.54), and initial attainment rate (r = −0.64–0.73). Simple linear regression analysis of all significant relationships showed that these predict between 28 and 42 \% of the variance in IV-RoMmax. This study found weak to moderate effects of individual kinematic variables and lumbar lordosis on IV-RoMmax at other intervertebral levels. These effects, when combined, may be important when such levels are being considered by healthcare professionals as potential sources of pain generation. Multivariate investigations in larger samples are warranted.}},

Accurate measurement of intervertebral kinematic parameters helps to understand the etiology and diagnosis of related diseases, and to evaluate the subsequent treatment. Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) which can obtain continuous, dynamic image sequences of lumbar motion at low radiation doses were introduced. The estimation of intervertebral kinematics depends on the precise localization of lumbar vertebrae. Usually, vertebral corners are identified and tracked by automated methods or manual method. This study presents a novel method for vertebral tracking based on the KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi, KLT) algorithm for intervertebral kinematics analysis. Accuracy of the proposed method was tested using a sagittal human image which contained two vertebral bodies, and the average errors achieved for displacement and angle were within 0.25 mm and 0.3°, respectively. To test the proposed method under clinical conditions, totally 11 volunteers were recruited and a result of more smoothness and stability in the intervertebral kinematics was obtained with comparing to the manual method by an experienced and trained clinician. In conclusion, the proposed method is an effective, accurate way to assess lumbar vertebrae tracking.}},

Operations of fusion for low back pain were initially done at the beginning of the last century for back pain thought to be related to congenital abnormalities or for past spinal infection. The recognition of the disc as a cause of sciatica, commonly associated with back pain, and the recognition that a degenerate disc led to abnormal movement suggested the concept that this abnormal movement was the cause of pain, and this abnormal movement came to be called “instability”. Much biomechanical expertise confirmed the fact that degenerate discs led to abnormal movement, there were many hypothesis as to why this caused pain. However clinical results of fusion for back pain were unpredictable. The failure of pedicle screws and cage fusion to improve the clinical results of fusion despite near 100\% fusion success, and the introduction of “flexible stabilization” and artificial discs, which demonstrated that despite the often unpredictable movement permitted by of these devices, clinical success was similar to fusion, directed attention to the other role of the disc, that of load transfer, which these devices also affected. Abnormal load transfer was already known to be critical in other joints in the body and had led to the use of osteotomy to realign joints. The relevance of load transfer to the future design of spinal implants used in the treatment of low back pain is discussed, and some finite element studies are reported demonstrating the likely effect of abnormal loading beneath an incompletely incorporated plate of an artificial disc, perhaps explaining in part the somewhat disappointing clinical results to date of the implantation of artificial discs.}},

Synthesis of the results established strong evidence (multiple high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for a positive change in skin conductance, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart rate among the healthy population. As only one study investigated changes in a symptomatic population, there was limited evidence (one RCT) for an increase in skin conductance and decrease in skin temperature.

To determine how different patterns of multilevel disc degeneration influence the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine. Summary of Background Data. Because of the complex etiology of low back pain, it is often difficult to identify the specific factors that contribute to the symptoms of a particular patient. Disc degeneration is associated with the development of low back pain, but its presence is not always synonymous with symptoms. However, studies have suggested that “patterns” of disc degeneration may provide insight into such pain generation rather than the overall presence of degenerative changes. Specifically, individuals with contiguous multilevel disc degeneration have been shown to exhibit higher presence and severity of low back pain than patients with skipped-level disc degeneration (i.e., healthy discs located in between degenerated discs). Methods. In this study, the biomechanical differences between these patterns were analyzed using a nonlinear finite element model of the lumbar spine. Thirteen separate “patterns” of disc degeneration were evaluated using the model and simulated under normal physiological loading conditions in each of the primary modes of spinal motion. Results. The results showed that stresses and forces of the surrounding ligaments, facets, and pedicles at certain vertebral levels of the spine were generally lower in skipped-level disc degeneration cases than in the contiguous multilevel disc degenerations cases even when the skipped level contained more degenerated discs. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first study to illustrate the biomechanics of specific patterns of disc degeneration of the lumbar spine. Using a multilevel disc degeneration model, our study provides insights as to why various patterns of disc degeneration throughout the lumbar spine may affect motion and soft tissue structures as well that may have bearing in the clinical pathway of pain generation.

PubMed and SCOPUS were used for the literature search. One hundred and twenty-five studies met primary inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from 49 sufficient quality studies.

Approximately one-third reported response rates. In sufficient quality articles, 82\% demonstrated at least one statistically significant association between the MSD(s) and biomarker(s) studied. The literature synthesis suggested that neck muscle size may be decreased in neck pain, and trapezius myalgia and neck/shoulder pain may be associated with reduced vascularity in the trapezius and reduced trapezius oxygen saturation at rest and in response to upper extremity tasks. Reduced vascularity in the supraspinatus tendon may also be a feature in rotator cuff tears. Five of eight studies showed an association between a quantitative imaging marker and MSD severity.

A dispositional theory of causation may overcome challenges that clinicians face in complex clinical presentations including those that are medically unexplained. Dispositionalism identifies causes not as regular events necessitating an effect but rather phenomena, which are highly complex, context‐sensitive, and which tend toward an effect. Diagnostic uncertainty and causal explanation are significant challenges in terms of clinical reasoning, communication, and the overall therapeutic outcome. This novel framework aims to facilitate improved collaborative clinical reasoning, enhanced patient‐practitioner interaction, and supported treatment planning.

  abstract = {{ It is generally accepted that spine control and stability are relevant for the prevention and rehabilitation of low back pain (LBP). However, there are conflicting results in the literature in regards to how these variables are modified in the presence of LBP. The aims of the present work were twofold: (1) to use noxious stimulation to induce LBP in healthy individuals to assess the direct effects of pain on control (quantified by the time-dependent behavior of kinematic variance), and (2) to assess whether the relationship between pain and control is moderated by psychological features (i.e. pain catastrophizing (PC) and kinesiophobia). Participants completed three conditions (baseline, pain, recovery) during a task involving completion of 35 cycles of a repetitive unloaded spine flexion/extension movement. The neuromuscular control of spine movements was assessed during each condition using maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents (λ max). Nociceptive stimulus involved injection of hypertonic saline into the interspinous ligament, eliciting pain that was greater than baseline and recovery (p <0.001). Although there was no overall main effect of the nociceptive stimulation (i.e. pain) on λ max when the whole group was included in the statistical model (p =0.564), when data were considered separately for those with high and low PC, two distinct and well established responses to the pain were observed. Specifically, those with high PC tightened their control (i.e. stabilized), whereas those with low PC loosened their control (i.e. destabilized). This study provides evidence that individuals’ beliefs and attitudes towards pain are related to individual-specific motor behaviors, and suggests that future research studying spine control/stability and LBP should account for these variables.}},

To improve the rehabilitation effectiveness of post-stroke patients, we developed a sensory stimulation-based continuous passive motion (CPM)-MT system with two different operating protocols, that is, asynchronous and synchronous modes. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measured brain activation through relative and absolute power spectral density (PSD) changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) mu rhythm in three cases with CMT and CPM-MT with asynchronous and synchronous modes. We also monitored changes in muscle fatigue, which is one of the negative effects of the CPM device, based on median power frequency (MPF) and root mean square (RMS). Relative PSD was most suppressed when subjects used the CPM-MT system under synchronous control: 22.11\%, 15.31\%, and 16.48\% on Cz, C3, and C4, respectively. The absolute average changes in MPF and RMS were 1.59\% and 9.78\%, respectively, with CPM-MT. Synchronous mode CPM-MT is the most effective method for brain activation, and muscle fatigue caused by the CPM-MT system was negligible. This study suggests the more effective combination rehabilitation system for MT by utilizing CPM and magnetic-based MT task to add action execution and sensory stimulation compared with CMT.}},

It not only increases the medical costs directly, but also raises the disability and loss of productivity in the general population. Symptoms include local pain over the spinal area, pain radiating to the lower leg, stiffness, and muscle tension. LBP is strongly linked with intervertebral disc degeneration that is further associated with the disruption of the complex anatomy of nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and adjacent supporting structures of the spine. Change in the shape and intensity of nucleus pulposus, decreased disc height, disc herniation, vertebral endplate changes, presence of osteophyte, and posterior high intensity zones are degenerative changes found in imaging studies. Every feature is considered while grading the severity score. Modic changes, DEBIT (disc extension beyond interspace) score, and Pfirrmann criteria are some of the scoring criteria used for evaluating disc degeneration severity. Moreover, the total number and contiguous pattern of affected discs play a crucial role in symptom generation of back pain. Many studies have reported asymptomatic patients. Thus, the correlation between degeneration severity found in imaging study and symptom severity of LBP remain unclear. This review discusses and summarizes the available literature on the significance of the association between the severity of degenerative changes found in imaging study with the presence and intensity of LBP.}},

Avoidance is adaptive in the short term but paradoxically may have detrimental long-term effects. Pain and pain-related responses compete with other demands in the environment.

This research used dynamic fluoroscopic studies to compare intervertebral angular motion sharing inequality and variability (MSI and MSV) during continuous lumbar motion in CNSLBP patients and controls. Passive recumbent and active standing protocols were used and the relationships of these variables to age and disc degeneration were assessed. Twenty patients with CNSLBP and 20 matched controls received quantitative fluoroscopic lumbar spine examinations using a standardised protocol for data collection and image analysis. Composite disc degeneration (CDD) scores comprising the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grades from L2–S1 were obtained. Indices of intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI) and variability (MSV) were derived and expressed in units of proportion of lumbar range of motion from outward and return motion sequences during lying (passive) and standing (active) lumbar bending and compared between patients and controls. Relationships between MSI, MSV, age and CDD were assessed by linear correlation. MSI was significantly greater in the patients throughout the intervertebral motion sequences of recumbent flexion (0.29 vs. 0.22, p = 0.02) and when flexion, extension, left and right motion were combined to give a composite measure (1.40 vs. 0.92, p = 0.04). MSI correlated substantially with age (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) and CDD (R = 0.70, p = 0.03) in lying passive investigations in patients and not in controls. There were also substantial correlations between MSV and age (R = 0.77, p = 0.01) and CDD (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) in standing flexion in patients and not in controls. Greater inequality and variability of motion sharing was found in patients with CNSLBP than in controls, confirming previous studies and suggesting a biomechanical marker for the disorder at intervertebral level. The relationship between disc degeneration and MSI was augmented in patients, but not in controls during passive motion and similarly for MSV during active motion, suggesting links between in vivo disc mechanics and pain generation.}},

Four electronic databases were systematically searched the 10th of March 2018, resulting in 12 included studies. Studies showed a risk of bias of 37.5\%-75\% using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies. Limited evidence reported higher amplitudes of balance-related potentials and early components of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) to noxious stimuli, and altered feedback-related negativity and P300 potentials during decision-making in chronic LBP (CLBP). These findings suggest postural strategies requiring a higher cortical attention-demand, increased sensory-discriminative processing of noxious input, and altered decision-making in CLBP. However, further research is warranted as these inferences were based on single studies. Moderate evidence for unaltered amplitude of late-phase SEPs to noxious stimuli and auditory evoked potentials in LBP implies that the affective-emotional processing of stimuli might be unaffected in LBP. Furthermore, moderate evidence indicated disturbed habituation of somatosensory stimuli in LBP. Most studies examined non-specific or mixed CLBP populations, hence EEG-quantified brain activity in (sub)acute or recurrent LBP still needs to be explored. Perspective: This review presents an overview of the current understanding of the functional LBP brain measured with EEG. The limited evidence in current research suggests altered cortical function regarding balance control, somatosensory processing and decision making in LBP, and highlights opportunities for future EEG-research.}},

Common biases identified were lack of assessor blinding and sample size calculation, use of samples of convenience, and poor experimental protocol standardization. Studies had small sample sizes. Range of motion maneuvers were the main task performed (33/62). Kinematic/kinetic data of different individual or combination of body segments/joints were reported among the studies, commonest was to assess the hip joint and lumbar segment motion (13/62). Only one study described full body movement. The most commonly reported outcome was range of motion. Statistically significant differences between controls and low back pain groups were reported for different outcomes among the studies.

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that sensorimotor impairments in LBP may be associated with brain changes. However, no consensus exists regarding the relationship between functional brain changes and sensorimotor behavior in LBP. Therefore, this review critically discusses the available functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on brain activation related to nonnociceptive somatosensory stimulation and motor performance in individuals with LBP. Four electronic databases were searched, yielding nine relevant studies. Patients with LBP showed reduced sensorimotor-related brain activation and a reorganized lumbar spine representation in higher-order (multi)sensory processing and motor regions, including primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, supplementary motor area, and superior temporal gyrus. These results may support behavioral findings of sensorimotor impairments in LBP. In addition, patients with LBP displayed widespread increased sensorimotor-evoked brain activation in regions often associated with abnormal pain processing. Overactivation in these regions could indicate an overresponsiveness to sensory inputs that signal potential harm to the spine, thereby inducing overgeneralized protective responses. Hence, functional brain changes could contribute to the development and recurrence of LBP. However, future studies investigating the causality between sensorimotor-related brain function and LBP are imperative.}},

  abstract = {{ Human lumbar motion segment is composed of various components with distinct contributions to its gross mechanical response. By employing experimental and computational approaches, many studies have investigated the relative role of each component as well as effects of various factors such as boundary-initial conditions, load magnitude-combination-direction, load temporal regime, preload, posture, degeneration, failures and surgical interventions on load-sharing. This paper reviews and critically discusses the relevant findings of in vitro and finite element model studies on load-sharing in healthy, aged, degenerate and damaged human lumbar motion segments. Two systematic searches were performed in PubMed (October 2018 - March 2019) using three sets of concepts (“lumbar spine”, “load-sharing” and “motion segment components”) followed by a complementary generic search. The segment overall response as well as the relative role of its constituents are markedly influenced by alterations in resection sequence, boundary conditions, geometry, loading characteristics (rate, magnitude, combinations and preloads), disc hydration, bone quality, posture and time (creep and cyclic). Structural transection order affects both findings and conclusions not only in force-control protocols but also in displacement-control loading regimes. Disc degeneration, endplate fracture and surgical resections significantly alter load transmission in the lumbar spine. In summary, in vitro and finite element model studies have together substantially improved our understanding of functional biomechanics (load-sharing) of human lumbar spine in normal and perturbed conditions acting as invaluable complementary tools in clinical applications.}},

Pain intensity is largely perceived as a subjective experience, what makes challenging its objective measurement. However, the physiological traces of pain make possible its correlation with vital signs, such as heart rate variability, skin conductance, electromyogram, etc., or health performance metrics derived from daily activity monitoring or facial expressions, which can be acquired with diverse sensor technologies and multisensory approaches. As the assessment and management of pain are essential issues for a wide range of clinical disorders and treatments, this paper reviews different sensor-based approaches applied to the objective evaluation of non-oncological chronic pain.

The main objectives were to investigate whether cortical activity can be (1) detected using functional fNIRS, and (2) if it is possible to distinguish between painful and nonpainful pressure as well as a tactile brushing stimulus based on relative changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin ([O2Hb] and [HHb]). Twenty right-handed subjects (33.5 ± 10.7 years; range 20–61 years; 8 women) participated in the study. Painful and nonpainful pressure stimulation was exerted with a thumb grip perpendicularly to the spinous process of the lumbar spine. Tactile stimulation was realized by a one-finger brushing. The supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) were measured bilaterally using a multichannel continuous-wave fNIRS imaging system. Characteristic relative changes in [O2Hb] in the SMA and S1 after both pressure stimulations (corrected for multiple comparison) were observed. [HHb] showed only much weaker changes (uncorrected). The brushing stimulus did not reveal any significant changes in [O2Hb] or [HHb]. The results indicate that fNIRS is sensitive enough to detect varying hemodynamic responses to different types of mechanosensory stimulation. The acquired data will serve as a foundation for further investigations in patients with chronic lower back pain. The future aim is to disentangle possible maladaptive neuroplastic changes in sensorimotor areas during painful and nonpainful lower back stimulations based on fNIRS neuroimaging.}},

  abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine is commonly used to identify the source of low back pain (LBP); however, its use has been questionable. Throughout the years, numerous lumbar phenotypes (e.g., endplate abnormalities, Modic changes, black disc) have been studied as possible pain generators. High-intensity zones (HIZs) are of particular interest as they may represent annular tears. However, for over three decades, there has been heated debate as to whether these imaging biomarkers are synonymous with LBP. Therefore, the following study addressed a systematic review of the reported literature addressing the relationship of HIZs and LBP. A systematic review was conducted via MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane, PubMed, PubMed Central, EMBASE via Ovid, and Web of Science with the following search terms: “HIZ,” “high intensity zone,” or “high intensity zones” and “low back pain,” “pain,” “lumbago,” and/or “sciatica.” Specific exclusion criteria were also maintained. Two independent reviewers searched the literature, selected the studies, and extracted the data. We identified six studies from our search strategy that met the inclusion criteria from a total of 756 possible studies. One cross-sectional population-based study and five comparison studies were identified, which provided information regarding the prevalence of HIZs. The prevalence of HIZs was 3 to 61\% in subjects with LBP and 2 to 3\% in subjects without LBP. Only three studies suggested a significant association between the presence of HIZ and LBP with or without sciatica. Our systematic review has found evidence that HIZs may be a possible risk factor for LBP; however, a mismatch of the clinical relevance of HIZs between studies still remains. The available evidence is limited by small sample size, heterogeneous study populations, and lack of standardized imaging methods for phenotyping. HIZs may be important lumbar biomarkers that demand further investigation and should be considered in the global imaging assessment of the spine, which may have immense clinical utility. Further large-scale studies with standardized imaging and classification techniques as well as the assessment of patterns of HIZs are necessary to better understand their role with LBP development.}},

This study investigated the in vivo characteristic motion patterns of the human lumbar spine during a dynamic axial rotation of the body. Specifically, the contribution of each motion segment to the lumbar axial rotation and the coupled bending of the vertebrae during the dynamic axial rotation of the body were analyzed. Eight asymptomatic subjects (M/F, 7/1; age, 40–60 years) were recruited. The lumbar segment of each subject was MRI scanned for construction of 3D models of the vertebrae from L2 to S1. The lumbar spine was then imaged using a dual fluoroscopic system while the subject performed a dynamic axial rotation from maximal left to maximal right in a standing position. The 3D vertebral models and the fluoroscopic images were used to reproduce the in vivo vertebral motion. In this study, we analyzed the primary left–right axial rotation, the coupled left–right bending of each vertebral segment from L2 to S1 levels. The primary axial rotations of all segments (L2–S1) followed the direction of the body axial rotation. Contributions of each to the overall segment axial rotation were 6.7° ± 3.0° (27.9 \%) for the L2–L3, 4.4° ± 1.2° (18.5 \%) for the L3–L4, 6.4° ± 2.2° (26.7 \%) for the L4–L5, and 6.4° ± 2.6° (27.0 \%) for the L5–S1 vertebral motion segments. The upper segments of L2–L3 and L3–L4 demonstrated a coupled contralateral bending towards the opposite direction of the axial rotation, while the lower segments of L4–L5 and L5–S1 demonstrated a coupled ipsilateral bending motion towards the same direction of the axial rotation. Strong correlation between the primary axial rotation and the coupled bending was found at each vertebral level. We did not observe patterns of coupled flexion/extension rotation with the primary axial rotation. This study demonstrated that a dynamic lumbar axial rotation coupling with lateral bendings is segment–dependent and can create a coordinated dynamic coupling to maintain the global dynamic balance of the body. The results could improve our understanding of the normal physiologic lumbar axial rotation and to establish guidelines for diagnosing pathological lumbar motion.}},

Stresses within intervertebral discs, ligaments, and passive muscles are thought to support this moment thereby allowing the extensor muscles to ‘turn off’. While the mechanical behaviour of the intervertebral disc and ligaments have been studied extensively, less is known regarding the moment supported by passive muscle tissue during spine flexion. Here we estimated the L4/L5 moment supported by the passive musculature during spine flexion based on experimentally derived architectural and material properties. We then tested the validity of the passive muscle prediction by determining whether the cumulative passive tissue moment (including passive muscle, intervertebral discs, and ligaments) would support the extensor moment demand—calculated with inverse dynamics—near maximum spine flexion. The model predicted that the passive tissues were able to support the entire extensor moment demand, indicating that muscle activity was not required to support the weight of the upper body, consistent with the mechanism of flexion relaxation. The model further demonstrated that despite being inactive, spine muscles still greatly contribute to flexion relaxation by passively supporting ∼47\% of the extensor moment demand on the spine. Finally, there was strong agreement between the predicted active muscle moments and the recorded spine muscle activity (EMG); this strong agreement persisted when the external moment was manipulated using a pulley-system. These findings provide additional confidence that the estimated passive muscle moments are reasonably accurate throughout spine flexion.}},

From this previous work, it appears that chronic pain is associated with altered brain morphology. The present study was undertaken to assess these potential alterations in patients with painful hip osteoarthritis (OA). We studied 16 patients with unilateral right-sided hip pain, before and 9 months after hip arthroplasty. This enabled comparison of gray matter volume in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain versus healthy controls, as well as identification of any changes in volume following alleviation of pain (after surgery). Assessment involved self-completion questionnaires to assess pain, function, and psychosocial variables, and magnetic resonance imaging scanning of the brain for VBM analysis. Significant differences in brain gray matter volume between healthy controls and patients with painful hip arthritis were seen. Specifically, areas of the thalamus in patients with chronic OA pain exhibited decreased gray matter volume. Furthermore, when these preoperative changes were compared with the brain morphology of the patients 9 months after surgery, the areas of reduced thalamic gray matter volume were found to have “reversed” to levels seen in healthy controls. Our findings confirm that gray matter volume decreases within the left thalamus in the presence of chronic pain and disability in patients with hip OA. The results also show that these thalamic volume changes reverse after hip arthroplasty and are associated with decreased pain and increased function. These findings have potential implications with regard to optimizing the timing of orthopedic interventions such as arthroplasty.}},

Due to differences in the applied methodology, the results have been difficult to compare, and previous reviews have been limited in scope.

Searches will be conducted on the Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ZETOC and CINAHL databases, along with a comprehensive review of grey literature and key journals. One reviewer will conduct the searches, but two independent reviewers will screen potential studies and assess the risk of bias within studies which meet the inclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa risk of bias tool, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines will be used to assess the quality of the data. Meta-analysis will be conducted where appropriate on groups of studies with homogenous methodology. Where studies are too heterogeneous to allow for meta-analysis, meta-synthesis will instead be completed, comparing results in terms of net increases or decreases of activity. This review aims to identify common adaptations of muscle activity in people with low back pain and it is expected that the results will influence future research directions and future rehabilitation approaches.

The palpatory findings which osteopaths claim are related to tissue changes may be linked to allostatic load. However, this putative link has not been formally investigated. Methods We conducted a scoping review to critically appraise the relevant literature on the relationship between allostatic processes and tissue alterations. This review evaluates the use and relevance of palpatory findings in osteopathic care. We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library for research exploring the links between tissue adaptation, allostasis and osteopathic palpatory findings (OPF). Results Recent studies provide insights into the role of allostatic regulation on body systems' responses related to tissue alterations. These results provide new insights into the relevance of OPF to clinical practice. Discussion We build upon the findings of our review to propose a putative model for OPF in clinical practice. Conclusion Although the clinical phenomena associated with OPF may be biologically plausible, it lacks the necessary underpinning research evidence. Arguably, the classical focus on the diagnosis of palpable tissue changes fails to integrate biological, social and neuropsychological aspects such as stress responses. Tissue alterations related to stress and allostatic load markers have been less studied. Tissue changes involved in the adaptive process may be useful to practitioners in the field of manual therapy, particularly in osteopathy. We propose that OPF are one of the multidimensional aspects that may inform osteopathic decision-making. However, they should be considered within a biopsychosocial perspective and taking into account concepts of allostatic load and regulation.}},

Although objective biomarkers for pain could substantially aid pain diagnosis and development of novel therapies, reliable markers for clinical pain have been elusive. In this study, individualized physical maneuvers were used to exacerbate clinical pain in patients with chronic low back pain (N = 53), thereby experimentally producing lower and higher pain states. Multivariate machine-learning models were then built from brain imaging (resting-state blood-oxygenation-level-dependent and arterial spin labeling functional imaging) and autonomic activity (heart rate variability) features to predict within-patient clinical pain intensity states (ie, lower vs higher pain) and were then applied to predict between-patient clinical pain ratings with independent training and testing data sets. Within-patient classification between lower and higher clinical pain intensity states showed best performance (accuracy = 92.45\%, area under the curve = 0.97) when all 3 multimodal parameters were combined. Between-patient prediction of clinical pain intensity using independent training and testing data sets also demonstrated significant prediction across pain ratings using the combined model (Pearson's r = 0.63). Classification of increased pain was weighted by elevated cerebral blood flow in the thalamus, and prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, and increased primary somatosensory connectivity to frontoinsular cortex. Our machine-learning approach introduces a model with putative biomarkers for clinical pain and multiple clinical applications alongside self-report, from pain assessment in noncommunicative patients to identification of objective pain endophenotypes that can be used in future longitudinal research aimed at discovery of new approaches to combat chronic pain.}},

  abstract = {{ The study investigated the potential for obtaining more accurate spine joint reaction force (JRF) estimates from musculoskeletal models by incorporating dynamic stereo X-ray imaging (DSX)-based in vivo lumbar vertebral rotational and translational kinematics compared to generic, rhythm (RHY)-based kinematics, while also observing the influence of accompanying inputs: intervertebral segment stiffness and neutral state. A full-body OpenSim musculoskeletal model, constructed by combining existing lower- and upper-body models, was driven based on one volunteer’s (female; age 25; 60.8 kg; 176 cm) anthropometrics and kinematics from a series of upright standing and straight-legged dynamic lifting tasks. The lumbar spine portion was modified in a step-wise manner to observe effects of: (1) RHY vs. DSX lumbar kinematics; (2) No disc (bushing) stiffness (NBS); generic, linear bushing stiffness (LBS); subject-specific nonlinear bushing stiffness (NLBS); (3) Upright standing (UP) vs. Supine (SUP) neutral state; (4) Weight lifted: 4.5 kg vs. 13.6 kg. L4L5 JRF from 24 model variations based on combinations of aforementioned parameters were compared. Rhythm-based kinematics without translational components tends to over-predict JRF (31\% and 39\% for compression and shear, respectively) compared to DSX-based kinematics. Additionally, differences due to accompanying passive stiffness and neutral state choice combinations were even larger (>50\%), indicating heightened demand on the quality of these accompanying inputs. The study not only highlights model sensitivity to choices made regarding the three primary inputs—kinematics, passive stiffness and neutral state— separately, but also how interactions between these choices can result in significant variability in joint loading estimates.}},

We deconstruct chronic pain into four distinct phases, each with specific mechanisms, and outline current state of knowledge regarding these mechanisms: the limbic brain imparting risk, and the mesolimbic learning processes reorganizing the neocortex into a chronic pain state.

Post-genome data explosion and development of high-throughput techniques led to resurfacing of those ideas and debates as a new incarnation called Systems Biology. Though experimental biologists have co-opted systems biology and hailed it as a paradigm shift, it is practiced in different shades and understood with divergent meanings. Biology has certain questions linked with organization of multiple components and processes. Often such questions involve multilevel systems. Here in this essay we argue that systems theory provides required framework and abstractions to explore those questions. We argue that systems biology should follow the logical and mathematical approach of systems theory and transmogrification of systems biology to mere collection of higher dimensional data must be avoided. Therefore, the questions that we ask and the priority of those questions should also change.

Methods Twenty patients with pain related to the head, neck or shoulders were imaged via videofluoroscopy as they underwent sagittal-plane flexion and extension. A clinician graded disc height loss and osteophytes as “severe/moderate”, “mild”, or “none”. A novel tracking algorithm quantified motions of each vertebra. This information was used to calculate intervertebral angular and shear displacements. The digital algorithm made it practical to track individual vertebrae in multiple patients through hundreds of images without bias. Findings Cases without height loss/osteophytes had a consistent increase in intervertebral angular displacement from C2/C3 to C5/C6, like that of healthy individuals, and mild height losses did not produce aberrations that were systematic or necessarily discernable. However, joints with moderate to severe disc height loss and osteophytes exhibited reduced range of motion compared to adjacent unaffected joints in that patient and corresponding joints in patients without structural irregularities. Interpretation Digitally-obtained motion histories of individual joints allowed anatomical joint changes to be linked with changes in joint movement patterns. Specifically, disc height loss and osteophytes were found to influence cervical spine movement in the sagittal plane, reducing angular motions at affected joints by approximately 10\% between those with and without height loss and osteophytes. Further, these joint changes were associated with perturbed intervertebral angular and shear movements.}},

The neural basis of chronic pain is still not completely understood. Previous work has implicated prefrontal brain areas in chronic pain. Furthermore, prefrontal neuronal oscillations at gamma frequencies (60-90 Hz) have been shown to reflect the perceived intensity of longer lasting experimental pain in healthy human participants. In contrast, noxious stimulus intensity has been related to alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-29 Hz) oscillations in sensorimotor areas. However, it is not fully understood how the intensity of ongoing pain as the key symptom of chronic pain is represented in the human brain. Here, we asked 31 chronic back pain patients to continuously rate their ongoing pain while simultaneously recording electroencephalography (EEG). Time-frequency analyses revealed a positive association between ongoing pain intensity and prefrontal beta and gamma oscillations. No association was found between pain and alpha or beta oscillations in sensorimotor areas. These findings indicate that ongoing pain as the key symptom of chronic pain is reflected by neuronal oscillations implicated in the subjective perception of longer lasting pain rather than by neuronal oscillations related to the processing of objective nociceptive input. The findings, thus, support a dissociation of pain intensity from nociceptive processing in chronic back pain patients. Furthermore, although possible confounds by muscle activity have to be taken into account, they might be useful for defining a neurophysiological marker of ongoing pain in the human brain.}},

This presents across a spectrum from subtle changes in the manner in which a task is completed to complete avoidance of a function and could be both a cause and effect of pain/nociceptive input and/or injury. Movement, in a variety of forms, is also recommended as a component of treatment to aid the recovery in many pain syndromes. Some argue it may not be sufficient to simply increase activity, whereas others defend a necessity to consider how a person moves. There is unlikely to be a simple relationship between pain and movement, as both too little and too much movement could be suboptimal for the health of the tissues. The interaction between pain, (re)injury, and movement is surprisingly unclear. Traditional theories to explain adaptation in the motor system in pain are unable to account for the variability observed in laboratory and clinical practice. New theories are required. Treatments that focus on physical activity and exercise are the cornerstone of management of many pain conditions, but the effect sizes are modest. There is limited consensus when, if, and how interventions may be individualized and combined.

This review presents a systematic appraisal, including effect size calculation of studies utilizing experimentally induced pain and experimental pain relief models to explore this concept. Fifteen studies were identified using MEDLINE and a review of reference lists. Experimentally induced pain did produce changes in electromyography and gait-related kinematics. However these effects were not universal. Experimental pain relief studies produced mixed results for improving maximal muscle function. These methodologies shared similar threats to validity and failed to fully answer the question due to methodological limitations; however possible mechanisms as to the effects of pain are discussed.

In 36 individuals with acute, non-specific, clinical low back pain (LBP) and 36 age- and sex-matched, pain-free controls, we investigated the processing of non-noxious afferent inputs using sensory evoked potentials (SEPs), as well as corticomotor excitability and organisation of the primary motor cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Processing of non-noxious sensory inputs was lower (smaller area of the N80-N150-P260 SEP complex) in acute LBP (F1,70=45.28, p<0.01). Examination of specific SEP components revealed smaller area of the N150 and P260 SEP components in acute LBP, although inter-individual variability was high. Motor cortical map volume was lower in acute LBP (F1,70=5.61, p=0.02). These findings demonstrate that acute LBP is characterised by lower sensorimotor cortical activity at the group level.

  abstract = {{Abstract Background With its high temporal resolution, electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity of cortical neuronal cells, is a potentially suitable technique to investigate human somatosensory processing. By using EEG, the processing of (nociceptive) stimuli can be investigated, along with the functionality of the nociceptive pathway. Therefore, it can be applied in chronic pain patients to objectify whether changes have occurred in nociceptive processing. Typically, so-called event-related potential (ERP) recordings are used, where EEG signals are recorded in response to specific stimuli and characterized by latency and amplitude. Objective To summarize whether differences in somatosensory processing occur between chronic pain patients and healthy controls, measured with ERPs, and determine whether this response is related to the subjective pain intensity. Design Systematic review. Setting and Methods PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were consulted, and 18 case–control studies were finally included. Subjects The chronic pain patients suffered from tension-type headache, back pain, migraine, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, prostatitis, or complex regional pain syndrome. Results Chronic neuropathic pain patients showed increased latencies of the N2 and P2 components, along with a decreased amplitude of the N2-P2 complex, which was also obtained in FM patients with small fiber dysfunction. The latter also showed a decreased amplitude of the N2-P3 and N1-P1 complex. For the other chronic pain patients, the latencies and the amplitudes of the ERP components did not seem to differ from healthy controls. One paper indicated that the N2-P3 peak-to-peak amplitude correlates with the subjective experience of the stimulus. Conclusions Differences in ERPs with healthy controls can mostly be found in chronic pain populations that suffer from neuropathic pain or where fiber dysfunction is present. In chronic pain populations with other etiological mechanisms, limited differences were found or agreed upon across studies.}},

  abstract = {{According to our hypothesis, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is an acute compression axonopathy of the nerve endings in the muscle spindle. It is caused by the superposition of compression when repetitive eccentric contractions are executed under cognitive demand. The acute compression axonopathy could coincide with microinjury of the surrounding tissues and is enhanced by immune-mediated inflammation. DOMS is masked by sympathetic nervous system activity at initiation, but once it subsides, a safety mode comes into play to prevent further injury. DOMS becomes manifest when the microinjured non-nociceptive sensory fibers of the muscle spindle stop inhibiting the effects of the microinjured, hyperexcited nociceptive sensory fibers, therefore providing the ‘open gate’ in the dorsal horn to hyperalgesia. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide play a cross-talking role in the parallel, interlinked degeneration–regeneration mechanisms of these injured tissues. We propose that the mitochondrial electron transport chain generated free radical involvement in the acute compression axonopathy. ‘Closed gate exercises’ could be of nonpharmacological therapeutic importance, because they reduce neuropathic pain in addition to having an anti-inflammatory effect. Finally, DOMS could have an important ontogenetical role by not just enhancing ability to escape danger to survive in the wild, but also triggering muscle growth.}},

  abstract = {{Pain is a highly unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, and no objective diagnosis test exists to assess it. In clinical practice there are two main methods for the estimation of pain, a patient’s self-report and clinical judgement. However, these methods are highly subjective and the need of biomarkers to measure pain is important to improve pain management, reduce risk factors, and contribute to a more objective, valid, and reliable diagnosis. Therefore, in this study we propose the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and machine learning for the identification of a possible biomarker of pain. We collected pain information from 18 volunteers using the thermal test of the quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol, according to temperature level (cold and hot) and pain intensity (low and high). Feature extraction was completed in three different domains (time, frequency, and wavelet), and a total of 69 features were obtained. Feature selection was carried out according to three criteria, information gain (IG), joint mutual information (JMI), and Chi-squared (χ2). The significance of each feature ranking was evaluated using three learning models separately, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) and support vector machines (SVM) using the linear and Gaussian and polynomial kernels. The results showed that the Gaussian SVM presented the highest accuracy (94.17\%) using only 25 features to identify the four types of pain in our database. In addition, we propose the use of the top 13 features according to the JMI criteria, which exhibited an accuracy of 89.44\%, as promising biomarker of pain. This study contributes to the idea of developing an objective assessment of pain and proposes a potential biomarker of human pain using fNIRS.}},

Methods PubMed and Web of Science were systematically screened for relevant literature using different combinations of keywords regarding structural and functional brain imaging techniques in patients with CLBP. Reference lists of included articles were hand-searched for additional literature. Eligible articles were assessed on risk of bias and reviewed by two independent researchers. Results The search query returned 27 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality varied from poor to good. A total of 10 studies evaluated structural gray matter changes. There is conflicting evidence in global gray matter changes, with both increases and decreases shown in different studies. Gray matter changes were demonstrated in specific brain regions. Structural white matter changes were reported in five studies. There is conflicting evidence in total white matter volume due to both increases and unchanged white matter. Several regional differences were identified in which white matter changes were shown. Functional organization during rest was evaluated in 10 studies. CLBP patients showed increased activation in specific regions, together with a disrupted default mode network. A total of six studies evaluated brain activity in response to a nociceptive stimulus. Findings suggest that patients demonstrated increased activity in pain-related regions, and decreased activity in analgesic regions. Conclusions Overall, there is moderate evidence for regional changes in gray and white matter, together with an altered functional connectivity during rest and increased activity in pain-related areas following painful stimulation, evidencing an upregulated pain matrix. More longitudinal research is needed to clarify the temporal relationship regarding pain and neuroplastic changes, and integration of different brain imaging techniques is warranted.}},

Elements of the autonomic examination include variations in the pulse, postural measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, pupillary light reactions, skin coloration and temperature, patterns of sweating, and other organ-specific physical findings relevant to the individual patient’s presentation. Especially important is the often neglected practice of measuring the blood pressure standing up, for orthostatic hypotension cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and is a common source of potential morbidity.

  abstract = {{The calculation of heart rate variability (HRV) is a popular tool used to investigate differences in cardiac autonomic control between population samples. When interpreting effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of group differences, researchers typically use Cohen's guidelines of small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8) effects. However, these guidelines were originally proposed as a fallback for when the effect size distribution (ESD) was unknown. Despite the availability of effect sizes from hundreds of HRV studies, researchers still largely rely on Cohen's guidelines to interpret effect sizes and to perform power analyses to calculate required sample sizes for future research. This article describes an ESD analysis of 297 HRV effect sizes from between-group/case-control studies, revealing that the 25th, 50th, and 75th effect size percentiles correspond with effect sizes of 0.26, 0.51, and 0.88, respectively. The analyses suggest that Cohen's guidelines may underestimate the magnitude of small and large effect sizes and that HRV studies are generally underpowered. Therefore, to better reflect the observed ESD, effect sizes of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.9 should be interpreted as small, medium, and large effects (after rounding to the closest 0.05). Based on power calculations using the ESD, suggested sample sizes are also provided for planning suitably powered studies that are more likely to replicate. Researchers are encouraged to use the ESD data set or their own collected data sets in tandem with the provided analysis script to perform custom ESD and power analyses relevant to their specific research area.}},

  abstract = {{ Background Recently we provided evidence for a leptin-independent homeostatic regulation, the gravitostat, of body weight in rodents. The aim of the present translational proof of concept study was to test the gravitostat hypothesis in humans. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled single center trial (ClinicalTrial.gov number, NCT03672903), to evaluate the efficacy of artificially increased weight loading on body weight in subjects with mild obesity (BMI 30–35 kg/m2). Subjects were either treated with a heavy (=high load; 11\% of body weight) or light (=low load; 1\% of body weight) weight vest for eight hours per day for three weeks. The primary outcome was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes included change in body fat mass and fat-free mass as measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Findings In total 72 participants underwent randomization and 69 (36 high load and 33 low load) completed the study for the primary outcome. High load treatment resulted in a more pronounced relative body weight loss compared to low load treatment (mean difference -1.37\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI), -1.96 to -0.79; p = 1.5 × 10−5). High load treatment reduced fat mass (-4.04\%, 95\% CI, -6,53 to -1.55; p = 1.9 × 10−3) but not fat free mass (0.43\%, 95\% CI, -1.47 to 2.34; p = 0.65) compared to low load treatment. Interpretation Increased weight loading reduces body weight and fat mass in obese subjects in a similar way as previously shown in obese rodents. These findings demonstrate that there is weight loading dependent homeostatic regulation of body weight, the gravitostat, also in humans.

All pain-free controls and 64.3\% of the individuals with LBP exhibited the FRP. Individuals with LBP and the FRP exhibited a delay of its onset compared to pain-free controls (significant mean difference of 13.3\% of trunk flexion).

  abstract = {{Availability of accurate three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of lumbar vertebrae is necessary to understand normal and pathological biomechanics of the lumbar spine. Due to the technical challenges of imaging the lumbar spine motion in vivo, it has been difficult to obtain comprehensive, 3D lumbar kinematics during dynamic functional tasks. The present study demonstrates a recently developed technique to acquire true 3D lumbar vertebral kinematics, in vivo, during a functional load-lifting task. The technique uses a high-speed dynamic stereo-radiography (DSX) system coupled with a volumetric model-based bone tracking procedure. Eight asymptomatic male participants performed weight-lifting tasks, while dynamic X-ray images of their lumbar spines were acquired at 30 fps. A custom-designed radiation attenuator reduced the radiation white-out effect and enhanced the image quality. High resolution CT scans of participants' lumbar spines were obtained to create 3D bone models, which were used to track the X-ray images via a volumetric bone tracking procedure. Continuous 3D intervertebral kinematics from the second lumbar vertebra (L2) to the sacrum (S1) were derived. Results revealed motions occurring simultaneously in all the segments. Differences in contributions to overall lumbar motion from individual segments, particularly L2–L3, L3–L4, and L4–L5, were not statistically significant. However, a reduced contribution from the L5–S1 segment was observed. Segmental extension was nominally linear in the middle range (20\%–80\%) of motion during the lifting task, but exhibited nonlinear behavior at the beginning and end of the motion. L5–S1 extension exhibited the greatest nonlinearity and variability across participants. Substantial AP translations occurred in all segments (5.0 ± 0.3 mm) and exhibited more scatter and deviation from a nominally linear path compared to segmental extension. Maximum out-of-plane rotations (<1.91 deg) and translations (<0.94 mm) were small compared to the dominant motion in the sagittal plane. The demonstrated success in capturing continuous 3D in vivo lumbar intervertebral kinematics during functional tasks affords the possibility to create a baseline data set for evaluating the lumbar spinal function. The technique can be used to address the gaps in knowledge of lumbar kinematics, to improve the accuracy of the kinematic input into biomechanical models, and to support development of new disk replacement designs more closely replicating the natural lumbar biomechanics.}},

To measure three-dimensional segmental motion in vivo using a noninvasive measurement technique. Summary of Background Data. Spinal instability has been implicated as a potential cause of low back pain, especially, axial rotational instability. Typically, flexion-extension lateral radiographs were used to quantify instability, but inaccurately measured translations and inability to capture out-of-plane rotations are limitations. Methods. Using a custom-calibrated rotation jig, L1–S1 CT reconstructions were created of volunteers in each of 3 positions: supine and left and right rotations of the torso with respect to the hips. Segmental motions were calculated using Euler angles and volume merge methods in three major planes. Results. Segmental motions were small (<4° or 6mm) with the greatest motions seen in axial rotation (range, 0.6° to 2.2°), lateral bending (range, −3.6° to 3.0°), and frontal translation (−1.2mm to 5.4mm). Largest motions were in the levels: L1–L2 to L3–L4. Conclusions. Complex coupled motions were measured due to external torsion and could be indicative of instability chronic patients with low back pain. The presented data provide baseline segmental motions for future comparisons to symptomatic subjects.}},

In 10 healthy individuals we recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in separate sessions at multiple time-points before, during and immediately after pain induced by hypertonic saline infusion in a hand muscle, and at 15 and 25 minutes follow-up. Participants reported an average pain intensity that was less in the session where SEPs were recorded (SEPs: 4.0±1.6; MEPs: 4.9±2.3). In addition, the time taken for pain to return to zero once infusion of hypertonic saline ceased was less for participants in the SEP session (SEPs: 4.7±3.8 mins; MEPs 9.4±7.4 mins). Both SEPs and MEPs began to reduce almost immediately after pain reached 5/10 following hypertonic saline injection and were significantly reduced from baseline by the second (SEPs) and third (MEPs) recording blocks during pain. Both parameters remained suppressed immediately after pain had resolved and at 15 and 25 minutes after the resolution of pain. These data suggest S1 processing and corticomotor output may be co-modulated in association with muscle pain. Interestingly, this is in contrast to previous observations. This discrepancy may best be explained by an effect of the SEP test stimulus on the corticomotor pathway. This novel finding is critical to consider in experimental design and may be potentially useful to consider as an intervention for the management of pain.}},

Its aim was to reach a consensus on how best to record, analyse, and communicate QF information for research and clinical purposes. The Forum recommended that images should be acquired during regular trunk motion that is controlled for velocity and range, in order to minimise externally imposed variability as well as to correlate intervertebral motion with trunk motion. This should be done in both the recumbent passive and weight bearing active patient configurations. The main recommended outputs from QF were the true ranges of intervertebral rotation and translation, neutral zone laxity and the consistency of shape of the motion patterns. The main clinical research priority should initially be to investigate the possibility of mechanical subgroups of patients with chronic, nonspecific low back pain by comparing their intervertebral motion patterns with those of matched healthy controls.}},

It has been observed that patients with chronic pain have maladaptive neuroplastic changes and difficulty in imagination processes. Objective To assess the ability of patients with chronic LBP (CLBP) to generate kinesthetic and visual motor images and the time they spent on this mental task compared with asymptomatic participants. Design A prospective, cross-sectional study. Setting Primary health care center in Madrid, Spain. Participants A total of 200 participants were classified into 2 groups: asymptomatic participants (n = 100) and patients with CLBP (n = 100). Methods After consenting to participate, all recruited participants received a sociodemographic questionnaire, a set of self-report measures and completed the Revised Movement Imagery Questionnaire. Main Outcomes Measurements Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability using the Revised Movement Imagery Questionnaire. A mental chronometry using a stopwatch and psychosocial variables using self-reported questionnaires. Results Our results indicated that patients with CLBP had difficulty generating kinesthetic and visual motor images and also took a longer time to imagine them. A regression analysis indicated that in the CLBP group, the predictor variable for fear of activity and coping symptom self-efficacy was visual motor imagery (explaining 16.2\% of the variance); however, the predictor variable for LBP disability and pain management self-efficacy was kinesthetic motor imagery (explaining 17.8\% of the variance). Conclusions It appears that patients with CLBP have greater difficulty generating visual and kinesthetic motor images compared with asymptomatic participants, and they also need more time to perform these mental tasks.

This study attempted to compare the motion contributions of adjacent lumbar levels during an active weight bearing flexion and return protocol in chronic, non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) patients and controls using quantitative fluoroscopy (QF). Eight CNSLBP patients received QF during guided standing lumbar flexion. Dynamic motion sharing of segments from L2 to S1 were calculated and analysed for interactions between levels. Eight asymptomatic controls were then matched to the 8 patients for age and sex and their motion sharing patterns compared. Share of intersegmental motion was found to be consistently highest at L2-L3 and L3-L4 and lowest at L5-S1 throughout the motion in both groups, with the exception of maximum flexion where L4-L5 received the greatest share. Change in motion sharing occurred throughout the flexion and return motion paths in both participant groups but tended to vary more at L4-L5 in patients (p<0.05). In patients, L5-S1 provided less angular range (p<0.05) and contributed less at maximum bend (p<0.05), while L3-L4, on average over the bending sequence, provided a greater share of motion (p<0.05). Intervertebral motion sharing inequality is therefore a normal feature during lumbar flexion. However, in patients, inequality was more pronounced, and variability of motion share at some levels increased. These effects may result from differences in muscular contraction or in the mechanical properties of the disc.}},

This research used dynamic fluoroscopic studies to compare intervertebral angular motion sharing inequality and variability (MSI and MSV) during continuous lumbar motion in CNSLBP patients and controls. Passive recumbent and active standing protocols were used and the relationships of these variables to age and disc degeneration were assessed. Twenty patients with CNSLBP and 20 matched controls received quantitative fluoroscopic lumbar spine examinations using a standardised protocol for data collection and image analysis. Composite disc degeneration (CDD) scores comprising the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grades from L2–S1 were obtained. Indices of intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI) and variability (MSV) were derived and expressed in units of proportion of lumbar range of motion from outward and return motion sequences during lying (passive) and standing (active) lumbar bending and compared between patients and controls. Relationships between MSI, MSV, age and CDD were assessed by linear correlation. MSI was significantly greater in the patients throughout the intervertebral motion sequences of recumbent flexion (0.29 vs. 0.22, p = 0.02) and when flexion, extension, left and right motion were combined to give a composite measure (1.40 vs. 0.92, p = 0.04). MSI correlated substantially with age (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) and CDD (R = 0.70, p = 0.03) in lying passive investigations in patients and not in controls. There were also substantial correlations between MSV and age (R = 0.77, p = 0.01) and CDD (R = 0.85, p = 0.004) in standing flexion in patients and not in controls. Greater inequality and variability of motion sharing was found in patients with CNSLBP than in controls, confirming previous studies and suggesting a biomechanical marker for the disorder at intervertebral level. The relationship between disc degeneration and MSI was augmented in patients, but not in controls during passive motion and similarly for MSV during active motion, suggesting links between in vivo disc mechanics and pain generation.}},

EEG acquisition technology, currently one of the main modalities used for mobile brain activity assessment, is widely spread and open for access and thus easily customizable. fNIRS technology on the other hand has either to be bought as a predefined commercial solution or developed from scratch using published literature. To help reducing time and effort of future custom designs for research purposes, we present our approach toward an open source multichannel stand-alone fNIRS instrument for mobile NIRS-based neuroimaging, neuroergonomics and BCI/BMI applications. The instrument is low-cost, miniaturized, wireless and modular and openly documented on www.opennirs.org. It provides features such as scalable channel number, configurable regulated light intensities, programmable gain and lock-in amplification. In this paper, the system concept, hardware, software and mechanical implementation of the lightweight stand-alone instrument are presented and the evaluation and verification results of the instrument's hardware and physiological fNIRS functionality are described. Its capability to measure brain activity is demonstrated by qualitative signal assessments and a quantitative mental arithmetic based BCI study with 12 subjects.}},

We describe competing types of illumination (trans-illumination, reflectance, and differential reflectance) and data collection methods (continuous wave, time domain and frequency domain). Basic components (light sources, detection, and recording components) of fNIRS systems are presented. Advantages and limitations of fNIRS techniques are offered, followed by a list of very practical recommendations for its use. A variety of experimental and clinical studies with fNIRS are sampled, shedding light on many brain-related ailments. Finally, we describe and discuss a number of freely available analysis and presentation packages suited for data analysis. In conclusion, we recommend fNIRS due to its ever-growing body of clinical applications, state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique and manageable hardware requirements. It can be safely concluded that fNIRS adds a new arrow to the quiver of neuro-medical examinations due to both its great versatility and limited costs.}},

Chronic pain is the greatest source of disability globally and claims related to chronic pain feature in many insurance and medico-legal cases. Brain imaging (for example, functional MRI, PET, EEG and magnetoencephalography) is widely considered to have potential for diagnosis, prognostication, and prediction of treatment outcome in patients with chronic pain. In this Consensus Statement, a presidential task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain examines the capabilities of brain imaging in the diagnosis of chronic pain, and the ethical and legal implications of its use in this way. The task force emphasizes that the use of brain imaging in this context is in a discovery phase, but has the potential to increase our understanding of the neural underpinnings of chronic pain, inform the development of therapeutic agents, and predict treatment outcomes for use in personalized pain management. The task force proposes standards of evidence that must be satisfied before any brain imaging measure can be considered suitable for clinical or legal purposes. The admissibility of such evidence in legal cases also strongly depends on laws that vary between jurisdictions. For these reasons, the task force concludes that the use of brain imaging findings to support or dispute a claim of chronic pain — effectively as a pain lie detector — is not warranted, but that imaging should be used to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain.}},

Despite its great promise, neuroimaging has yet to substantially impact clinical practice and public health. However, a developing synergy between emerging analysis techniques and data-sharing initiatives has the potential to transform the role of neuroimaging in clinical applications. We review the state of translational neuroimaging and outline an approach to developing brain signatures that can be shared, tested in multiple contexts and applied in clinical settings. The approach rests on three pillars: (i) the use of multivariate pattern-recognition techniques to develop brain signatures for clinical outcomes and relevant mental processes; (ii) assessment and optimization of their diagnostic value; and (iii) a program of broad exploration followed by increasingly rigorous assessment of generalizability across samples, research contexts and populations. Increasingly sophisticated models based on these principles will help to overcome some of the obstacles on the road from basic neuroscience to better health and will ultimately serve both basic and applied goals.}},

This paper aims to quantify the time-variant and load-dependent characteristics of intervertebral contributions to L2–S1 extension during a dynamic lifting task. Eleven healthy participants lifted multiple weights (4.5, 9.1, and 13.6kg) from a trunk-flexed to an upright position while being imaged by a dynamic stereo X-ray system at 30frames/s. Vertebral (L2–S1) motion was tracked using a previously validated volumetric model-based tracking method that employs 3D bone models reconstructed from subject-specific CT images to obtain high-accuracy (≤0.26°, 0.2mm) 3D vertebral kinematics. Individual intervertebral motions as percentages of the total L2–S1 extension were computed at each \% increment of the motion to show the segmental apportionment. Results showed L3–L4 (25.8±2.2\%) and L4–L5 (31±3.1\%) together contributed a larger share (∼60\% combined) compared to L2–L3 (21.7±3.7\%) and L5–S1 (22.6±4.7\%); L4–L5 consistently provided the largest contribution of the measured segments. Relative changes over time in L3–L4 (6±12.5\%) and L4–L5 (0.5±10.2\%) contribution were minimal; in contrast, L2–L3 (18±20.1\%) contribution increased while L5–S1 (−33±22.9\%) contribution decreased in a somewhat complementary fashion as motion progressed. No significant effect of the magnitude of load lifted on individual segmental contribution patterns was detected. The current study updated the knowledge regarding apportionment of lumbar (L2–S1) motion among individual segments, serving both as input into musculoskeletal models and as potential biomechanical markers of low back disorders.}},

The aim of our investigation was the description of the lumbar spine's cortical representation in healthy subjects during the application of measured manual pressure. Twenty participants in the prone position were investigated during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An experienced manual therapist applied non‐painful, posterior‐to‐anterior (PA) pressure on three lumbar spinous processes (L1, L3, and L5). The pressure (30 N) was monitored and controlled by sensors. The randomized stimulation protocol consisted of 68 pressure stimuli of 5 s duration. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses were analyzed in relation to the lumbar stimulations. The results demonstrate that controlled PA pressure on the lumbar spine induced significant activation patterns. The major new finding was a strong and consistent activation bilaterally in the somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2). In addition, bilateral activation was located medially in the anterior cerebellum. The activation pattern also included other cortical areas probably related to anticipatory postural adjustments. These revealed stable somatosensory maps of the lumbar spine in healthy subjects can subsequently be used as a baseline to investigate cortical and subcortical reorganization in low back pain patients.

  abstract = {{In vivo three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of the lumbar spine has not been well evaluated by the conventional methods because of their methodological limitations, while 3D intervertebral motions have been quantitatively determined by cadaver studies. We thus developed a novel 3D analyzing system for the relative motions of individual vertebrae using 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analyzed in vivo 3D intervertebral motions of the lumbar spine during trunk rotation. Ten healthy volunteers underwent 3D MRI of the lumbar spine in nine positions with 15° increments during trunk rotation (0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, and maximum). Relative motions of the lumbar spine were calculated by automatically superimposing a segmented 3D MRI of the vertebra in the neutral position over images of each position using the voxel-based registration method. These 3D motions were represented with 6 degrees of freedom by Euler angles and translations on the coordinate system. The mean axial rotation of ten healthy volunteers of each lumbar spinal segment in 45° trunk rotation to each side ranged from 1.2° to 1.7°. Coupled flexion with axial rotation was observed at the segments from L1/2 to L5/S1. Coupled lateral bending of the segments from L1/2 to L4/5 was in the opposite direction of the trunk rotation, while that of T12/L1 and L5/S1 was in the same direction. The direction of the coupled lateral bending in the present study was different from that in the previous cadaver study only at L4/5. This difference might result from the non-load state of the supine position in the current study and/or the non-physiological state in the cadaver study. Our system has two limitations: (1) the study was conducted with each volunteer in the supine position, and (2) because the rotation device regulated trunk rotation, trunk rotation might not have been physiological. In vivo 3D intervertebral motions of the lumbar spine during trunk rotation were evaluated using our novel motion analysis system. These data may be useful for the optimal orthopaedic management of lumbar spinal disorders.}},

  abstract = {{Across neuroscience research, clinical diagnostics, and engineering applications in pain evaluation and treatment, there is a need for an objective measure of pain experience and detection when it occurs. This detector should be reliable in real-world settings using easily accessible, non-invasive data sources. We present a simple yet robust paradigm for decoding pain using neural and physiological data including electroencephalography (EEG), pulse, and skin conductance (GSR) measurements. The present study uses multivariate classification to distinguish painful events from non-painful multimodal sensory stimuli. To classify the pain response and detect relevant data attributes, we employed a sparse logistic regression (SLR) machine learning protocol with automatic feature selection. EEG input consisted of time-frequency changes under trial conditions, and physiological data included fluctuations and spikes in pulse and skin conductance. Classification averaged 70\% accuracy and selected between 5 and 15 features. In our experiment, pain was induced by cold stimulation which became noxious with prolonged exposure. Due to the long, ramp-and-hold nature of the stimulus, along with individual variability in sensitivity to pain, we did not observe specific rapid evoked responses or time-locked events common across participants. However, this format more closely resembles the experience of pain conditions requiring intervention which could be facilitated by a decoding system. The results illustrate the feasibility of developing a wireless pain detection system and give insight to important temporal, spectral, and spatial EEG events and physiological indicators of pain states. Success of the classifier protocol using these parameters could lead to the creation of a closed-loop system for decoding and intervention which can be applied in engineering and medical contexts.}},

Thus, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers to enable selection of the appropriate drug for the individual patient, a concept known as personalized medicine. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) and clinical parameters can provide some guidance for response, but better and more objective biomarkers are urgently warranted. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be suitable since it assesses the central nervous system where opioids mediate their effects. Clinical parameters, QST and EEG (during rest and tonic pain) was recorded from patients the day prior to total hip replacement surgery. Postoperative pain treatment was performed using oxycodone and piritramide as patient‐controlled analgesia. Patients were stratified into responders and non‐responders based on pain ratings 24 h post‐surgery. Parameters were analysed using conventional group‐wise statistical methods. Furthermore, EEG was analysed by machine learning to predict individual response. Eighty‐one patients were included, of which 51 responded to postoperative opioid treatment (30 non‐responders). Conventional statistics showed that more severe pre‐existing chronic pain was prevalent among non‐responders to opioid treatment (p = 0.04). Preoperative EEG analysis was able to predict responders with an accuracy of 65\% (p = 0.009), but only during tonic pain. Chronic pain grade before surgery is associated with the outcome of postoperative pain treatment. Furthermore, EEG shows potential as an objective biomarker and might be used to predict postoperative opioid analgesia. The current clinical study demonstrates the viability of EEG as a biomarker and with results consistent with previous experimental results. The combined method of machine learning and electroencephalography offers promising results for future developments of personalized pain treatment.}},

  abstract = {{In individuals having low back pain, the application of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) has been shown to reduce spinal stiffness in those who report improvements in post-SMT disability. The underlying mechanism for this rapid change in stiffness is not understood presently. As clinicians and patients may benefit from a better understanding of this mechanism in terms of optimizing care delivery, the objective of this scoping review of current literature was to identify if potential mechanisms that explain this clinical response have been previously described or could be elucidated from existing data. Three literature databases were systematically searched (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PubMed). Our search terms included subject headings and keywords relevant to SMT, spinal stiffness, lumbar spine, and mechanism. Inclusion criteria for candidate studies were publication in English, quantification of lumbar spinal stiffness before and after SMT, and publication between January 2000 and June 2019. The search identified 1931 articles. Of these studies, 10 were included following the application of the inclusion criteria. From these articles, 7 themes were identified with respect to potential mechanisms described or derived from data: 1) change in muscle activity; 2) increase in mobility; 3) decrease in pain; 4) increase in pressure pain threshold; 5) change in spinal tissue behavior; 6) change in the central nervous system or reflex pathways; and 7) correction of a vertebral dysfunction. This scoping review identified 7 themes put forward by authors to explain changes in spinal stiffness following SMT. Unfortunately, none of the studies provided data which would support the promotion of one theme over another. As a result, this review suggests a need to develop a theoretical framework to explain rapid biomechanical changes following SMT to guide and prioritize future investigations in this important clinical area.}},

The power of the early evoked magnetic field (<100 ms) elicited by painful stimulation of the painful back in very chronic patients was elevated relative to that elicited by painful back stimulation of healthy controls and showed a linear increase with chronicity (r=0.74). The maximum activity elicited in primary somatosensory cortex was shifted more medially in the very chronic back pain subjects.

This study used contemporaneous quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) and surface electromyography (sEMG) to investigate relationships between continuous inter-vertebral motion variables and muscle electrical activity in the lumbar multifidus (LMU), lumbar and thoracic erector spinae (LES and TES) during standardised lumbar flexion and return in 18 healthy male human subjects. Our results demonstrated that the variability in the sharing of angular motion (i.e. Motion Share Variability MSV) and motion segment laxity during a bending task were significantly (p<0.05) negatively correlated (Spearman) with muscle electrical activity throughout the participant bend for both locally and globally acting muscle groups. MSV was also strongly correlated with L2-3 laxity. The former suggests a damping mechanism reducing irregular displacements (i.e. less variability in the sharing of segmental motion) during bending and an action of spinal stabilisation by muscles at segmental levels, and the latter a synergy between laxity at L2-3 and MSV. While this has previously been theorised, it has never been shown in vivo at the inter-vertebral level. These assessments may be considered for use in validation studies of exercise programs for CNSLBP, however further replication is required.}},

  abstract = {{Lower limb rehabilitation is a fundamental part of post-acute care in neurological disease. Early commencement of active workout is often prevented by paresis, thus physical treatment may be delayed until patients regain some voluntary command of their muscles. Passive mobilization of the affected joints is mostly delivered in order to safeguard tissue properties and shun circulatory problems. The present paper investigates the potential role of early passive motion in stimulating cortical areas of the brain devoted to the control of the lower limb. An electro-mechanical mobilizer for the ankle joint (Toe-Up!) was implemented utilizing specially-designed shape-memory-alloy-based actuators. This device was constructed to be usable by bedridden subjects. Besides, the slowness and gentleness of the imparted motion, make it suitable for patients in a very early stage of their recovery. The mobilizer underwent technical checks to confirm reliability and passed the required safety tests for electric biomedical devices. Four healthy volunteers took part in the pre-clinical phase of the study. The protocol consisted in measuring of brain activity by EEG and NIRS in four different conditions: rest, active dorsiflexion of the ankle, passive mobilization of the ankle, and assisted motion of the same joint. The acquired data were processed to obtain maps of cortical activation, which were then compared. The measurements collected so far show that there is a similar pattern of activity between active and passive/assisted particularly in the contralateral premotor areas. This result, albeit based on very few observations, might suggest that passive motion provides somatosensory afferences that are processed in a similar manner as for voluntary control. Should this evidence be confirmed by further trials on healthy individuals and neurological patients, it could form a basis for a clinical use of early passive exercise in supporting central functional recovery.}},

Fifty-five healthy male (34) and female (21) pain free participants aged 21–80 years received quantitative fluoroscopic (QF) imaging both actively during standing and passively in the lateral decubitus position. The following five imaging protocols were extracted from 2 motion examinations, which were repeated 6 weeks apart: 1. Static during upright free bending. 2. Maximum during controlled upright bending, 3. At the end of controlled upright bending, 4. Maximum during controlled recumbent bending, 5. At the end of controlled recumbent bending. Intervertebral flexion translations from L2-S1 were determined for each protocol and their measurement errors (intra subject repeatability) calculated. Estimations using static, free bending radiographic images gave measurement errors of up to 4 mm, which was approximately twice that of the QF protocols. Significantly higher ranges at L4-5 and L5-S1 were obtained from the static protocol compared with the QF protocols. Weight bearing ranges at these levels were also significantly higher in males regardless of the protocol. Clinical decisions based on sagittal translations of less than 4 mm would therefore require QF imaging.}},

  abstract = {{Perception is the foundation of cognition and is fundamental to our beliefs and consequent action planning. The Editorial (this issue) asks: “what mechanisms, if any, mediate between perceptual and cognitive processes?” It has recently been argued that attention might furnish such a mechanism. In this paper, we pursue the idea that action planning (motor preparation) is an attentional phenomenon directed toward kinesthetic signals. This rests on a view of motor control as active inference, where predictions of proprioceptive signals are fulfilled by peripheral motor reflexes. If valid, active inference suggests that attention should not be limited to the optimal biasing of perceptual signals in the exteroceptive (e.g., visual) domain but should also bias proprioceptive signals during movement. Here, we investigate this idea using a classical attention (Posner) paradigm cast in a motor setting. Specially, we looked for decreases in reaction times when movements were preceded by valid relative to invalid cues. Furthermore, we addressed the hierarchical level at which putative attentional effects were expressed by independently cueing the nature of the movement and the hand used to execute it. We found a significant interaction between the validity of movement and effector cues on reaction times. This suggests that attentional bias might be mediated at a low level in the motor hierarchy, in an intrinsic frame of reference. This finding is consistent with attentional enabling of top-down predictions of proprioceptive input and may rely upon the same synaptic mechanisms that mediate directed spatial attention in the visual system.}},

  abstract = {{People with a history of low back pain (LBP) exhibit altered responses to postural perturbations, and the central neural control underlying these changes in postural responses remains unclear. To characterize more thoroughly the change in muscle activation patterns of people with LBP in response to a perturbation of standing balance, and to gain insight into the influence of early- vs. late-phase postural responses (differentiated by estimates of voluntary reaction times), this study evaluated the intermuscular patterns of electromyographic (EMG) activations from 24 people with and 21 people without a history of chronic, recurrent LBP in response to 12 directions of support surface translations. Two-factor general linear models examined differences between the 2 subject groups and 12 recorded muscles of the trunk and lower leg in the percentage of trials with bursts of EMG activation as well as the amplitudes of integrated EMG activation for each perturbation direction. The subjects with LBP exhibited 1) higher baseline EMG amplitudes of the erector spinae muscles before perturbation onset, 2) fewer early-phase activations at the internal oblique and gastrocnemius muscles, 3) fewer late-phase activations at the erector spinae, internal and external oblique, rectus abdominae, and tibialis anterior muscles, and 4) higher EMG amplitudes of the gastrocnemius muscle following the perturbation. The results indicate that a history of LBP associates with higher baseline muscle activation and that EMG responses are modulated from this activated state, rather than exhibiting acute burst activity from a quiescent state, perhaps to circumvent trunk displacements.}},

  abstract = {{This article explores the notion that the brain is genetically endowed with an innate virtual reality generator that – through experience-dependent plasticity – becomes a generative or predictive model of the world. This model, which is most clearly revealed in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreaming, may provide the theater for conscious experience. Functional neuroimaging evidence for brain activations that are time-locked to rapid eye movements (REMs) endorses the view that waking consciousness emerges from REM sleep – and dreaming lays the foundations for waking perception. In this view, the brain is equipped with a virtual model of the world that generates predictions of its sensations. This model is continually updated and entrained by sensory prediction errors in wakefulness to ensure veridical perception, but not in dreaming. In contrast, dreaming plays an essential role in maintaining and enhancing the capacity to model the world by minimizing model complexity and thereby maximizing both statistical and thermodynamic efficiency. This perspective suggests that consciousness corresponds to the embodied process of inference, realized through the generation of virtual realities (in both sleep and wakefulness). In short, our premise or hypothesis is that the waking brain engages with the world to predict the causes of sensations, while in sleep the brain’s generative model is actively refined so that it generates more efficient predictions during waking. We review the evidence in support of this hypothesis – evidence that grounds consciousness in biophysical computations whose neuronal and neurochemical infrastructure has been disclosed by sleep research.}},

We describe the different pain-related fear conditioning paradigms using proprioceptive and interoceptive CSs and painful stimuli as USs that have been developed to study specific forms of pain-related fear (i.e. fear of movement, fear of touch, fear of visceral sensations, and fear of penetration) that are relevant for different chronic pain conditions (i.e. musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, visceral pain, and genital pain). We present evidence that patients with chronic pain demonstrate impaired safety learning and excessive fear generalization; learning anomalies that have also been observed in anxiety disorders. Extinction-based protocols (exposure in vivo) have been developed to reduce pain-related fear and increase daily functioning in various chronic pain disorders. Finally, we outline some challenges and future directions to further our understanding of learning mechanisms underlying the development, persistence, and treatment of chronic pain disability.}},

Recently we observed adaptive changes in motor cortical organisation in patients with recurrent low back pain (LBP), which are linked to altered motor coordination. Although changes in motor coordination can be trained and are associated with improved symptoms and function, it remains unclear whether these training-induced changes are related to reorganisation of the motor cortex. This was investigated using the model of a delay in postural activation of the deep abdominal muscle, transversus abdominis (TrA) in 20 individuals with recurrent LBP. Subjects were allocated to either motor skill training that involved isolated voluntary contractions of TrA, or a control intervention of self-paced walking exercise for 2 weeks. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from TrA bilaterally using intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. Motor cortical organisation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and postural activation associated with single rapid arm movements were investigated before and after training. Motor skill training induced an anterior and medial shift in motor cortical representation of TrA, towards that observed in healthy individuals from our previous study. This shift was associated with earlier postural activation of TrA. Changes were not observed following unskilled walking exercise. This is the first observation that motor training can reverse reorganisation of neuronal networks of the motor cortex in people with recurrent pain. The observed relationship between cortical reorganisation and changes in motor coordination following motor training provides unique insight into potential mechanisms that underlie recovery.}},

This disruption in autonomic balance can be measured through the assessment of heart rate variability (HRV), that is, the variability of the interval between consecutive heart beats. However, there is yet to be a systematic evaluation of the body of literature concerning HRV across several chronic pain conditions. Moreover, modern meta-analytical techniques have never been used to validate and consolidate the extent to which HRV may be decreased in chronic pain. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines, this study systematically evaluated and critically appraised the literature concerning HRV in people living with chronic pain. After screening 17,350 sources, 51 studies evaluating HRV in a chronic pain group met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-six moderate–high quality studies were included in quantitative meta-analyses. On average, the quality of studies was moderate. There were 6 frequency-domain and time-domain measures of HRV across a broad range of chronic pain conditions. High heterogeneity aside, pooled results from the meta-analyses reflected a consistent, moderate-to-large effect of decreased high-frequency HRV in chronic pain, implicating a decrease in parasympathetic activation. These effects were heavily influenced by fibromyalgia studies. Future research would benefit from wider use of standardised definitions of measurement, and also investigating the synergistic changes in pain state and HRV throughout the development and implementation of mechanism-based treatments for chronic pain.}},

One strategy to attenuate M1 excitability is to influence prefrontal and premotor cortex activity. Working memory tasks, e.g. the two-back task (TBT), engage prefrontal and premotor cortices and may influence M1 excitability. We hypothesized that performing the TBT during pain would influence pain-related changes in M1 excitability. Participants (n = 28) received rigorous training in the TBT before baseline testing. Experimental pain was induced by injecting hypertonic saline into the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Participants rated pain intensity on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (NRS) every second min until pain-resolved (PR) during the performance of the TBT (n = 14) or during REST (n = 14). In the TBT, letters were presented pseudo-randomly, and accuracy and reaction time to identified letters corresponding to letters shown two times back were recorded. M1 excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded at baseline, and at PR, PR + 10, PR + 20, and PR + 30 min. Four minutes after hypertonic saline injection, the pain NRS scores were higher in the TBT group than the REST group (p = 0.009). No time × group interaction was found for MEPs (p = 0.73), but a main effect of time (p < 0.0005) revealed a reduction of MEPs at PR up until PR + 30 (p < 0.008). The TBT accuracy improved at PR + 30 in both groups (p = 0.019). In conclusion, the pain-induced reduction in corticomotor excitability was unaffected by performing a working memory task, despite greater pain in the TBT group.}},

These issues hinder the utility and transparency of new methods to the research community. Here I present revtools, an R package to support article screening during evidence synthesis projects. It provides tools for the import and de-duplication of bibliographic data, screening of articles by title or abstract, and visualization of article content using topic models. The software is entirely open-source and combines command-line scripting for experienced programmers with custom-built user interfaces for casual users, with further methods to support article screening to be added over time.

The temporal profiles of trial-wise physiological responses were characterized by component scores obtained from principal component analysis. These component scores were then used as predictors in a linear regression analysis, resulting in accurate pain predictions for individual trials. Using the temporal information encoded in the principal component scores explained the data better than prediction by a single summary statistic (ie, maximum amplitude). These results indicate that perceived pain is best reflected by the temporal dynamics of autonomic responses. Application of the regression model to an independent data set of 20 subjects resulted in a very good prediction of the pain ratings demonstrating the generalizability of the identified temporal pattern. Utilizing the readily available temporal information from skin conductance and pupil diameter responses thus allows parametric prediction of pain in human subjects.}},

  abstract = {{Chronic low back pain (chronic LBP) is both debilitating for patients but also a major burden on the health care system. Previous studies reported various maladaptive structural and functional changes among chronic LBP patients on spine- and supraspinal levels including behavioral alterations. However, evidence for cortical reorganization in the sensorimotor system of chronic LBP patients is scarce. Motor Imagery (MI) is suitable for investigating the cortical sensorimotor network as it serves as a proxy for motor execution. Our aim was to investigate differential MI-driven cortical processing in chronic LBP compared to healthy controls (HC) by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-nine subjects (15 chronic LBP patients, 14 HC) were included in the current study. MI stimuli consisted of randomly presented video clips showing every-day activities involving different whole-body movements as well as walking on even ground and walking downstairs and upstairs. Guided by the video clips, subjects had to perform MI of these activities, subsequently rating the vividness of their MI performance. Brain activity analysis revealed that chronic LBP patients exhibited significantly reduced activity compared to HC subjects in MI-related brain regions, namely the left supplementary motor area and right superior temporal sulcus. Furthermore, psycho-physiological-interaction analysis yielded significantly enhanced functional connectivity (FC) between various MI-associated brain regions in chronic LBP patients indicating diffuse and non-specific changes in FC. Current results demonstrate initial findings about differences in MI-driven cortical processing in chronic LBP pointing towards reorganization processes in the sensorimotor network.}},

Direct in vivo evidence for altered biomechanics following lumbar fusion is lacking.

This study analyzed seven patients with symptomatic lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (5 M, 2 F; age 65±5.1 years) using a biplane radiographic imaging system. Each subject performed two to three trials of continuous flexion of their torso according to established protocols. Synchronized biplane radiographs were acquired at 20 images per second one month before and six months after single-level fusion at L4-L5 or L5-S1, or two-level fusion at L3-L5 or L4-S1. A previously validated volumetric model-based tracking process was used to track the position and orientation of vertebrae in the radiographic images. Intervertebral flexion/extension and AP translation (slip) at the superior adjacent segment were calculated over the entire dynamic flexion activity. Skin-mounted surface markers were tracked using conventional motion analysis and used to determine torso flexion. Change in adjacent segment kinematics after fusion was determined at corresponding angles of dynamic torso flexion. Changes in adjacent segment motion varied across patients, however, all patients maintained or increased the amount of adjacent segment slip or intervertebral flexion/extension. No patients demonstrated both decreased adjacent segment slip and decreased rotation. This study suggests that short-term changes in kinematics at the superior adjacent segment after lumbar fusion appear to be patient-specific.}},

Here, we investigated whether such “physiological networks”—sets of segregated brain regions that exhibit similar responses following slow changes in systemic physiology—resemble patterns associated with large-scale networks typically attributed to remotely synchronized neuronal activity. By analyzing a large group of subjects from the 3T Human Connectome Project (HCP) database, we demonstrate brain-wide and noticeably heterogenous dynamics tightly coupled to either respiratory variation or heart rate changes. We show, using synthesized data generated from physiological recordings across subjects, that these physiologically-coupled fluctuations alone can produce networks that strongly resemble previously reported resting-state networks, suggesting that, in some cases, the “physiological networks” seem to mimic the neuronal networks. Further, we show that such physiologically-relevant connectivity estimates appear to dominate the overall connectivity observations in multiple HCP subjects, and that this apparent “physiological connectivity” cannot be removed by the use of a single nuisance regressor for the entire brain (such as global signal regression) due to the clear regional heterogeneity of the physiologically-coupled responses. Our results challenge previous notions that physiological confounds are either localized to large veins or globally coherent across the cortex, therefore emphasizing the necessity to consider potential physiological contributions in fMRI-based functional connectivity studies. The rich spatiotemporal patterns carried by such “physiological” dynamics also suggest great potential for clinical biomarkers that are complementary to large-scale neuronal networks.}},

These predictions are compared to the results from 30 clinical studies and three induced pain studies retrieved in a comprehensive literature search. Neither of the two models is unequivocally supported by the literature. These data and further data on timing of muscle activity and load sharing between muscles suggest an alternative model to explain the alterations of trunk muscle recruitment due to low-back pain. It is proposed that motor control changes in patients are functional in that they enhance spinal stability.}},

  abstract = {{Chronic back pain is a common disability, which is often accredited to intervertebral disc degeneration. Gold standard interventions such as spinal fusion, which are mainly designed to mechanically seal the defect, frequently fail to restore the native biomechanics. Moreover, artificial implants have limited success as a repair strategy, as they do not alter the underlying disease and fail to promote tissue integration and subsequent native biomechanics. The reported high rates of spinal fusion and artificial disc implant failure have pushed intervertebral disc degeneration research in recent years towards repair strategies. Intervertebral disc repair utilizing principles of tissue engineering should theoretically be successful, overcoming the inadequacies of artificial implants. For instance, advances in the development of scaffolds aided with cells and growth factors have opened up new possibilities for repair strategies. However, none has reached the stage of clinical trials in humans. In this review, we describe the hitches encountered in the musculoskeletal field and summarize recent advances in designing tissue-engineered constructs for promoting nucleus pulposus repair. Additionally, the review focuses on the effect of biomaterial aided with cells and growth factors on achieving effective functional reparative potency, highlighting the ways to enhance the efficacy of these treatments.}},

Of particular focus of this review was the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When faced with a stressor, the HPA axis provides the frontline of defence resulting in the production of cortisol, measurement of which has been shown to be a reliable indicator of HPA axis activity. Manual therapy has been shown to influence the HPA axis. However, a functional cross-talk has been clearly demonstrated between the HPA axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, with cortisol and testosterone inhibiting each other at all levels. This mutual inhibition may mean that multiple measures across these two systems (HPA-HPG axis) should be considered to provide an accurate representation of stress physiology. The balance between testosterone and cortisol represented as a ratio termed T/C ratio has been used for this purpose. Given the implicit role of the HPA-HPG axis in pain and inflammation and an apparent gender difference in pain perception and treatment response, T/C ratio may be of interest to osteopaths as it may enable us to capture the holistic effects of osteopathy. This review revisits the function of the HPA axis in pain and inflammation, presents a dual hormone approach in measuring the HPA axis and evaluates the implications for osteopathic practice and research.}},

This study evaluated the associations of task-related and person-related factors with the effect of low back pain on anticipatory postural adjustments.MethodsThirteen subjects with and 13 without low back pain performed seated, rapid arm flexion in self-initiated and cued conditions. Mixed-model ANOVA were used to evaluate group and condition effects on APA onset latencies of trunk muscles, arm-raise velocity, and pre-movement cortical potentials. These measures were evaluated for correlation with pain ratings, Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire scores, and Modified Oswestry Questionnaire scores.FindingsDelayed postural adjustments of subjects with low back pain were greater in the cued condition than in the self-initiated condition. The group with low back pain exhibited larger-amplitude cortical potentials than the group without pain, but also significantly slower arm-raise velocities. With arm-raise velocity as a covariate, the effect of low back pain remained significant for the latencies of postural adjustments but not for cortical potentials. Latencies of the postural adjustments significantly correlated with Oswestry and Fear Avoidance Beliefs scores.InterpretationDelayed postural adjustments with low back pain appear to be influenced by cueing of movement, pain-related disability and fear of activity. These results highlight the importance of subject characteristics, task condition, and task performance when comparing across studies or when developing treatment of people with low back pain.}},

This study aimed to assess the validity of a commercial HRM on a large study sample, with emphasis on gender and age. Simultaneous recordings of R–R intervals were conducted with the Polar RS800 HRM and a 3-lead ECG on 341 individuals. Data editing was performed with individually designated software for each instrument. Agreement on SDNN, RMSSD, and HF- and LF power was assessed with intraclass correlations (ICCs), standard errors of measurement (SEMs) and Bland and Altman plots. The HRM was not able to identify 18 observations with non-sinus beats. For men, agreement between instruments ranged from good to excellent (ICC ≥ 0.8) on all HRV measures, and SEMs were generally small. For women the results were weaker, with unacceptable agreement between instruments on SDNN. Women over 60 years did not reach a critical ICC value of 0.75 on any of the HRV measures. Bland and Altman plots demonstrated that the RS800 generally overestimated HRV, and that uncertainty increased with higher values. Since the Polar system did not identify errors satisfactorily, or return valid values of HRV for certain groups, it is concluded that, whenever possible, traditional ECGs should be used for both gathering and editing of HRV data.}},

  abstract = {{Low back pain (LBP) can significantly reduce the quality of life of patients, and has a considerable economic and social impact worldwide. It is commonly associated with disc degeneration, even though many people with degenerate discs are asymptomatic. Degenerate disc disease (DDD), is thus a common term for intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration associated with LBP. Degeneration is thought to lead to LBP because of nerve ingrowth into the degenerate disc, inflammation, or because degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) alters spinal biomechanics inappropriately. Thus, while the objectives of some interventions for LBP are to control pain intensity, other interventions aim to deal with the consequences of disc degeneration through stabilizing the disc surgically, by inserting artificial discs or by repairing the disc biologically and preventing progressive IVD degeneration. Despite tremendous research efforts, treatment of LBP through the use of regenerative interventions aiming to repair the IVD is still controversial. The use of mesenchymal stem cells for IVD regeneration in a patient‐based case will be discussed by an ensemble of clinicians and researchers. This T2‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging reveals single‐level intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration at the L4/5. The 22‐year‐old patient has been complaining about low back pain for 8 months despite conservative treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a regenerative treatment option have been tested as a feasible injection therapy for degenerate disc disease. Despite promising preclinical trials, clinical results are insufficient and multicenter, prospective, randomized trials remain to be conducted. Nevertheless, MSCs hold great regenerative potential due to their proliferation characteristics, their anabolic functionality and inflammation‐modulatory properties. The main challenge for a successful cell‐based IVD therapy can be seen in the harsh microenvironment of the degenerated IVDs that limits the viability and functionality of injected MSCs. However, preconditioning approaches including new emerging techniques in genomics have the potential to prepare MSCs for the survival in IVDs and to take MSCs therapies to the next step..}},

Thirty-seven patients with treatment-resistant back pain referred for quantitative fluoroscopy were matched to an equal number of pain-free controls for age and sex. All received passive recumbent flexion assessments for intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI), variability (MSV), laxity and translation. Comparisons were made between patient subgroups, between patients and controls and against normative levels from a separate group of controls. Eleven patients had had surgical or interventional procedures, and ten had spondylolisthesis or pars defects. Sixteen had no disruption. Patients had significantly higher median MSI values (0.30) than controls (0.27, p = 0.010), but not MSV (patients 0.08 vs controls 0.08, p = 0.791). Patients who received invasive procedures had higher median MSI values (0.37) than those with bony defects (0.30, p = 0.018) or no disruption (0.28, p = 0.0007). Laxity and translation above reference limits were not more prevalent in patients. Patients with treatment-resistant nonspecific back pain have greater MSI values than controls, especially if the former have received spinal surgery. However, excessive laxity, translation and MSV are not more prevalent in these patients. Thus, MSI should be investigated as a pain mechanism and for its possible value as a prognostic factor and/or target for treatment in larger patient populations.

In particular, spine related injuries in the US affect upwards of 5.7 million people each year. The degenerative disc disease treatment almost always arises due to a clinical presentation of pain and/or discomfort. Preferred conservative treatment modalities include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, chiropractic work, and dietary supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin. Artificial disc replacement, also known as total disc replacement, is a treatment alternative to spinal fusion. The goal of artificial disc prostheses is to replicate the normal biomechanics of the spine segment, thereby preventing further damage to neighboring sections. Artificial functional disc replacement through permanent metal and polymer-based components continues to evolve, but is far from recapitulating native disc structure and function, and suffers from the risk of unsuccessful tissue integration and device failure. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies combine novel material structures, bioactive factors and stem cells alone or in combination to repair and regenerate the IVD. These efforts are at very early stages and a more in-depth understanding of IVD metabolism and cellular environment will also lead to a clearer understanding of the native environment which the tissue engineering scaffold should mimic. The current review focusses on the strategies for a successful regenerative scaffold for IVD regeneration and the need for defining new materials, environments, and factors that are so finely tuned in the healthy human intervertebral disc in hopes of treating such a prevalent degenerative process.}},

Electromyography (EMG) was used to measure the pattern of muscle activity, onset of muscle activation, and peak activation of bilateral lumbar multifidus and iliocostalis. Movements were investigated before and after pain relief, through the self-administration of oral analgesia.ResultsElectromyography profiles and peak values were reliable across 3 trials, and EMG profiles correlated well with kinematic profiles. Specific EMG profiles were commonly associated with specific kinematic values, and on the whole, the EMG profiles were unaffected by pain relief. Muscle onset times and peak muscle amplitudes were not affected by pain relief in either acute or chronic low back pain.ConclusionThis study showed that the EMG activities from the lumbar region, including lumbar multifidus and iliocostalis, are reliable, and specific EMG profiles are identifiable.

A few hypotheses have attempted to explain these varied clinical and research findings. A new hypothesis, based upon the concept that subfailure injuries of ligaments (spinal ligaments, disc annulus and facet capsules) may cause chronic back pain due to muscle control dysfunction, is presented. The hypothesis has the following sequential steps. Single trauma or cumulative microtrauma causes subfailure injuries of the ligaments and embedded mechanoreceptors. The injured mechanoreceptors generate corrupted transducer signals, which lead to corrupted muscle response pattern produced by the neuromuscular control unit. Muscle coordination and individual muscle force characteristics, i.e. onset, magnitude, and shut-off, are disrupted. This results in abnormal stresses and strains in the ligaments, mechanoreceptors and muscles, and excessive loading of the facet joints. Due to inherently poor healing of spinal ligaments, accelerated degeneration of disc and facet joints may occur. The abnormal conditions may persist, and, over time, may lead to chronic back pain via inflammation of neural tissues. The hypothesis explains many of the clinical observations and research findings about the back pain patients. The hypothesis may help in a better understanding of chronic low back and neck pain patients, and in improved clinical management.}},

Material and Methods: Surface electromyography (sEMG) was performed on the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles of 120 subjects (73 F; 47 M), both at time T0 and T2. The sample was divided into three randomized groups of 40 subjects each: control, placebo, and osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT). In the T1 interval between the two evaluations, the control group was not treated, the placebo group underwent a placebo treatment, and the OMT group underwent manipulative treatment. The mean value of each measurement and its coefficient of variation, between time T0 and T2, were calculated for both the intragroup (OMT, placebo, control) and the intergroup (OMT-placebo, OMT-control). Outcomes: In 40\% of the subjects, statistically significant improvements were highlighted in the OMT. Whereas, the statistically significant results of the placebo and control groups were 7.5\% and 17.5\%, respectively, of which more than 75\% moved away from the physiological range, showing a worsening of the muscular activity. This analysis showed statistically significant variations (p ≤ 0.05) in the OMT group compared to the placebo and the control groups.

  abstract = {{In this study we investigated sensorimotor processing of painful pressure stimulation on the lower back of patients with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation. The main objectives were whether patients with CLBP show different relative changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin ([O2Hb] and [HHb]) in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) compared to healthy controls (HC). Twelve patients with CLBP (32 ± 6.1 years; range: 24–44 years; nine women) and 20 HCs (33.5 ± 10.7 years; range 22–61 years; eight women) participated in the study. Painful and non-painful pressure stimulation was exerted with a thumb grip perpendicularly to the spinous process of the lumbar spine. A force sensor was attached at the spinous process in order to control pressure forces. Tactile stimulation was realized by a one-finger brushing. Hemodynamic changes in the SMA and S1 were measured bilaterally using a multi-channel continuous wave fNIRS imaging system and a multi-distant probe array. Patients with CLBP showed significant stimulus-evoked hemodynamic responses in [O2Hb] only in the right S1, while the HC exhibited significant [O2Hb] changes bilaterally in both, SMA and S1. However, the group comparisons revealed no significant different hemodynamic responses in [O2Hb] and [HHb] in the SMA and S1 after both pressure stimulations. This non-significant result might be driven by the high inter-subject variability of hemodynamic responses that has been observed within the patients group. In conclusion, we could not find different stimulus-evoked hemodynamic responses in patients with CLBP compared to HCs. This indicates that neither S1 nor the SMA show a specificity for CLBP during pressure stimulation on the lower back. However, the results point to a potential subgrouping regarding task-related cortical activity within the CLBP group; a finding worth further research.}},

This makes possible deeper study of the condition’s biometrics. However, the measurement of change over time involves error. The purpose of this prospective investigation is to determine the intrasubject repeatability of six in vivo intervertebral motion parameters using quantitative fluoroscopy. Intrasubject reliability (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC) of baseline to 6-week follow-up measurements were calculated for six lumbar spine intervertebral motion parameters in 109 healthy volunteers. A standardised quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) protocol was used to provide measurements in the coronal and sagittal planes using both passive recumbent and active weight-bearing motion. Parameters were: intervertebral range of motion (IV-RoM), laxity, motion sharing inequality (MSI), motion sharing variability (MSV), flexion translation and anterior disc height change during flexion. The best overall intrasubject reliability (ICC) and agreement (MDC) were for disc height (ICC 0.89, MDC 43\%) and IV-RoM (ICC 0.96, MDC 60\%), and the worst for MSV (ICC 0.04, MDC 408\%). Laxity, MSI and translation had acceptable reliability (most ICCs > 0.60), but not agreement (MDC > 85\%). Disc height and IV-RoM measurement using QF could be considered for randomised trials, while laxity, MSI and translation could be considered for moderators, correlates or mediators of patient-reported outcomes. MSV had both poor reliability and agreement over 6 weeks. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.}},

Precisely, functional changes of the lumbar multifidus muscles (MF) involved in spine stability may be of special interest in rehabilitation. Therefore, we tested MF corticomotor control using double transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms for the first time in this muscle and examined its link with MF volitional activation. Eleven individuals with lateralized CLBP and 13 pain-free participants were recruited. Ultrasound imaging enabled measurement of MF volitional isometric contraction in prone lying. TMS of MF M1 area was used to test hemispheric excitability and mechanisms in relation to motor programming, i.e., active motor threshold (AMT), amplitude of motor-evoked potentials and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (SICF). In CLBP, SICI level was lower in the left hemisphere and MF volitional contraction was not related to AMT (M1 excitability), conversely to what was observed in the pain-free group. No other between-group difference was detected. These original findings support a plasticity of cortical maps controlling paravertebral muscles and likely including a different motor strategy for the control of MF. Changes of M1 function may thus underlie impaired motor control of lumbopelvic spine and pain persistence in CLBP.}},

  abstract = {{Neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have shown that nociceptive stimuli elicit responses in an extensive cortical network including somatosensory, insular and cingulate areas, as well as frontal and parietal areas. This network, often referred to as the "pain matrix", is viewed as representing the activity by which the intensity and unpleasantness of the perception elicited by a nociceptive stimulus are represented. However, recent experiments have reported (i) that pain intensity can be dissociated from the magnitude of responses in the "pain matrix", (ii) that the responses in the "pain matrix" are strongly influenced by the context within which the nociceptive stimuli appear, and (iii) that non-nociceptive stimuli can elicit cortical responses with a spatial configuration similar to that of the "pain matrix". For these reasons, we propose an alternative view of the functional significance of this cortical network, in which it reflects a system involved in detecting, orienting attention towards, and reacting to the occurrence of salient sensory events. This cortical network might represent a basic mechanism through which significant events for the body's integrity are detected, regardless of the sensory channel through which these events are conveyed. This function would involve the construction of a multimodal cortical representation of the body and nearby space. Under the assumption that this network acts as a defensive system signaling potentially damaging threats for the body, emphasis is no longer on the quality of the sensation elicited by noxious stimuli but on the action prompted by the occurrence of potential threats.}},

Repair strategies using biomaterials can be optimized based on the biomechanical and biological requirements of the IVD.PurposeTo review the present literature on the effects of degeneration, simulated degeneration, and injury on biomechanics of the IVD, with special attention paid to needle puncture injuries, which are a pathway for diagnostics and regenerative therapies and the promising biomaterials for disc repair with a focus on how those biomaterials may promote biomechanical repair.Study designA narrative review to evaluate the role of biomechanics on disc degeneration and regenerative therapies with a focus on what biomechanical properties need to be repaired and how to evaluate and accomplish such repairs using biomaterials. Model systems for the screening of such repair strategies are also briefly described.MethodsArticles were selected from two main PubMed searches using keywords: intervertebral AND biomechanics (1,823 articles) and intervertebral AND biomaterials (361 articles). Additional keywords (injury, needle puncture, nucleus pressurization, biomaterials, hydrogel, sealant, tissue engineering) were used to narrow the articles down to the topics most relevant to this review.ResultsDegeneration and acute disc injuries have the capacity to influence nucleus pulposus (NP) pressurization and annulus fibrosus (AF) integrity, which are necessary for an effective disc function and, therefore, require repair. Needle injection injuries are of particular clinical relevance with the potential to influence disc biomechanics, cellularity, and metabolism, yet these effects are localized or small and more research is required to evaluate and reduce the potential clinical morbidity using such techniques. NP replacement strategies, such as hydrogels, are required to restore the NP pressurization or the lost volume. AF repair strategies including cross-linked hydrogels, fibrous composites, and sealants offer promise for regenerative therapies to restore AF integrity. Tissue engineered IVD structures, as a single implantable construct, may promote greater tissue integration due to the improved repair capacity of the vertebral bone.ConclusionsIVD height, neutral zone characteristics, and torsional biomechanics are sensitive to specific alterations in the NP pressurization and AF integrity and must be addressed for an effective functional repair. Synthetic and natural biomaterials offer promise for NP replacement, AF repair, as an AF sealant, or whole disc replacement. Meeting mechanical and biological compatibilities are necessary for the efficacy and longevity of the repair.}},

  abstract = {{Age-related brain changes likely contribute to mobility impairments, but the specific mechanisms are poorly understood. Current brain measurement approaches (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), PET) are limited by inability to measure activity from the whole brain during walking. The Mind in Motion Study will use cutting edge, mobile, high-density electroencephalography (EEG). This approach relies upon innovative hardware and software to deliver three-dimensional localization of active cortical and subcortical regions with good spatial and temporal resolution during walking. Our overarching objective is to determine age-related changes in the central neural control of walking and correlate these findings with a comprehensive set of mobility outcomes (clinic-based, complex walking, and community mobility measures). Our hypothesis is that age-related walking deficits are explained in part by the Compensation Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH). CRUNCH is a well-supported model that describes the over-recruitment of brain regions exhibited by older adults in comparison to young adults, even at low levels of task complexity. CRUNCH also describes the limited brain reserve resources available with aging. These factors cause older adults to quickly reach a ceiling in brain resources when performing tasks of increasing complexity, leading to poor performance. Two hundred older adults and twenty young adults will undergo extensive baseline neuroimaging and walking assessments. Older adults will subsequently be followed for up to 3 years. Aim 1 will evaluate whether brain activity during actual walking explains mobility decline. Cross sectional and longitudinal designs will be used to study whether poorer walking performance and steeper trajectories of decline are associated with CRUNCH indices. Aim 2 is to harmonize high-density EEG during walking with fNIRS (during actual and imagined walking) and fMRI (during imagined walking). This will allow integration of CRUNCH-related hallmarks of brain activity across neuroimaging modalities, which is expected to lead to more widespread application of study findings. Aim 3 will study central and peripheral mechanisms (e.g., cerebral blood flow, brain regional volumes, and connectivity, sensory function) to explain differences in CRUNCH indices during walking. Research performed in the Mind in Motion Study will comprehensively characterize the aging brain during walking for developing new intervention targets.}},

The selected feature of pain measure is the concentration change of oxygenated hemoglobin.

Passive contributions from erector spinae stretching during the flexion posture and active contributions from other muscles (quadratus lumborum and deep erector spinae among others) further assist in load sharing in the trunk flexion posture. A number of studies have shown differences in the FRP between patients with chronic low back pain and healthy individuals, and the reliability of the assessment. Persistent activation of the lumbar erector spinae musculature among patients with back pain may represent the body's attempt to stabilize injured or diseased spinal structures via reflexogenic ligamentomuscular activation thereby protecting them from further injury and avoiding pain.ConclusionsThe myoelectric silencing of the erector spinae muscles in the trunk flexion posture is indicative of increased load sharing on passive structures, which tissues have been found to fail under excessive loading conditions and shown to be a source of low back pain. The studies that show differences in the presence of the FRP among patients and control subjects are encouraging for this type of clinical assessment and suggest that assessment of the FRP is a valuable objective clinical tool to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with low back pain.}},

  abstract = {{Joint inflammation is present in a subpopulation of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Proinflammatory cytokines are known to sensitize the peripheral and central pain pathways. This can be mechanistically assessed by pressure pain thresholds and temporal summation of pain (TSP). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) combined with paracetamol are recommended as OA treatment. The current study hypothesized that evidence of central sensitization would predict poor responses to peripherally directed therapies in knee OA and therefore aimed to investigate the value of mechanistic pain profiling for predicting pain outcome of treatment with NSAIDs plus paracetamol. One hundred thirty-two patients received ibuprofen 1200 mg/daily, paracetamol 3 g/daily, and pantoprazole 20 mg/daily for 3 weeks. Before administration, cuff pain detection, tolerance threshold, and TSP were assessed. Worst pain within the last 24 hours and pain during activity (visual analogue scales) were assessed before and after treatment. Facilitated TSP was found at baseline in the nonresponders to the 3-weeks treatment as compared to responders for both the 30\% and 50\% pain alleviation criteria (P < 0.02). Linear regression models identified facilitated TSP (P < 0.01) and low clinical pain scores (P < 0.001) as independent factors for prediction of poor pain alleviation by the treatment. In conclusion, this study found that mechanistic pain profiling can predict pain alleviation of NSAIDs and paracetamol. Facilitated TSP and low clinical pain scores before treatment are independent predictors of poor pain alleviation after NSAIDs and paracetamol. This study adds to the growing evidence that a subgroup of knee OA patients with manifested central sensitization may require special management attention.}},

To assess the effectiveness of Delitto's classification–based treatment approach compared with usual physical therapy care in patients with subacute or chronic low back pain. Summary of Background Data. No trial has evaluated this approach in patients with subacute and chronic low back pain. Methods. Before randomization, all patients were classified by research physical therapists according to a modified version of Delitto's classification–based system. Randomization was computer-generated, with centralized allocation concealment. The statistician and the physical therapists were unblinded. Patients and assistants who collected follow-up questionnaires were blinded. Follow-up assessments were completed at 8, 26, and 52 weeks. The primary analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, using multilevel analysis. The main outcomes were global perceived effect, disability (Oswestry Disability Index, 0–100), and pain intensity (Numerical Rating Scale, 0–10). Secondary outcomes were quality of life, fear-avoidance beliefs, and psychosocial status. Results. A total of 156 patients were included (classification-based group, n = 74; usual physical therapy group, n = 82). There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups for any of the outcomes at any of the follow-up time points. After 8 weeks, patients in the classification-based group had greater global perceived effect scores; adjusted odds ratio of 1.01 (95\&percnt; confidence interval \&lsqb;CI\&rsqb;, 0.31 to 3.28), and higher adjusted Oswestry Disability Index and Numerical Rating Scale scores; mean adjusted differences of 0.48 points (95\&percnt; CI, −4.59 to 3.63) and 0.49 points (95\&percnt; CI, −1.34 to 0.37) respectively, but all differences were statistically nonsignificant.

  abstract = {{Abstract Background and purpose Isometric activation (ISOM) of deep multifidi muscles (MF) can influence postural adjustments and primary motor cortex (M1) function in chronic low back pain (CLBP). In order to better understand how ISOM impacts on CLBP condition, the present study contrasted ISOM aftereffects on Ml function, MF postural activation and pain with another training, the global activation of paravertebral muscles (GLOB, hip extension). The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of ISOM and GLOB (3-week training each) on MF postural activation and Ml function in a CLBP population. Methods Twenty-four people with CLBP were randomly allocated to ISOM and GLOB groups for a 3- week daily practice. Pre/post-training after-effects were assessed by the onset of superficial MF (MF-S) activation during ballistic limb movements (bilateral shoulder flexion in standing; unilateral hip extension in prine lying), MF-S corticomotor control tested by transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1, and assessment of pain, kinesiophobia and disability by standardized questionnaires. Results Both ISOM and GLOB improved pain and disability. However, only ISOM influenced Ml function (decreased corticospinal excitability and increased intracortical inhibition), fastened MF-S postural activation and decreased kinesiophobia. Conclusions Changes of corticospinal excitability and of MF-S postural adjustments suggest that ISOM better influenced brain plasticity. Future studies should further test whether our novel findings relate to an influence of the exercises on the lumbopelvic control of different muscles and on cognitive function. Clinically, individual’s evaluation remains warranted before prescribing one or the other of these two conventional exercises for reducing pain. Implications This original study presents how motor control exercises can influence brain plasticity and postural control in chronic low back pain. This knowledge will impact on the decision of clinicians to prescribe specific exercises with a view of improving motor control in this musculoskeletal condition.}},

  abstract = {{Contingent negative variation (CNV) is a negative cortical wave that precedes a pre‐cued imperative stimulus requiring a quick motor response. It has been related to motor preparation and anticipatory attention. The aim was to ascertain whether the clinical improvement of functional movement disorders after physiotherapy would be associated with faster reaction times and modulation of CNV. Motor performance and CNV were analysed during a pre‐cued choice reaction time task with varying cue validity. Twenty‐one patients with functional movement disorders and 13 healthy controls at baseline were compared. Patients then underwent physiotherapy. At follow‐up after physiotherapy, patients were categorized as clinically improved (responders) or not improved (non‐responders) and retested. At baseline, patients did not generate CNV, contrary to controls [mean amplitude (µV) at the end of preparation to move: patients −0.47 (95\% CI −1.94, 1.00) versus controls −2.59 (95\% CI −4.46, −0.72)]. Responders performed faster after physiotherapy [mean natural logarithm (ln) reaction time (RT) (ms): follow‐up 6.112 (95\% CI 5.923, 6.301) versus baseline 6.206 (95\% CI 6.019, 6.394), P = 0.010], contrary to non‐responders. Simultaneously, responders showed a recovery of CNV after physiotherapy [follow‐up −1.95 (95\% CI −3.49, −0.41) versus baseline −0.19 (95\% CI −1.73, 1.35), P < 0.001], contrary to non‐responders [follow‐up −0.32 (95\% CI −1.79, 1.14) versus baseline −0.72 (95\% CI −2.19, 0.75), P = 0.381]. Clinical improvement of functional movement disorders after physiotherapy was associated with faster reaction times and normalization of CNV, which was absent at baseline. These findings suggest that CNV may constitute a useful neurophysiological biomarker related to abnormal attention in functional movement disorders.}},

Interoception is an umbrella term that encompasses (1) the afferent (body‐to‐brain) signaling through distinct neural and humoral (including immune and endocrine) channels; (2) the neural encoding, representation, and integration of this information concerning internal bodily state; (3) the influence of such information on other perceptions, cognitions, and behaviors; (4) and the psychological expression of these representations as consciously accessible physical sensations and feelings. Interoceptive mechanisms ensure physiological health through the cerebral coordination of homeostatic reflexes and allostatic responses that include motivational behaviors and associated affective and emotional feelings. Furthermore, the conscious, unitary sense of self in time and space may be grounded in the primacy and lifelong continuity of interoception. Body‐to‐brain interactions influence physical and mental well‐being. Consequently, we show that systematic investigation of how individual differences, and within‐individual changes, in interoceptive processing can contribute to the mechanistic understanding of physical and psychological disorders. We present a neurobiological overview of interoception and describe how interoceptive impairments at different levels relate to specific physical and mental health conditions, including sickness behaviors and fatigue, depression, eating disorders, autism, and anxiety. We frame these findings in an interoceptive predictive processing framework and highlight potential new avenues for treatments.

  abstract = {{Trunk muscle dysfunction is often regarded as a key feature of non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) despite being poorly understood and variable with increases, decreases and no change in muscle activity reported. Differences in thoraco-lumbar kinematics have been observed in motor control impairment NSCLBP subgroups (Flexion Pattern, Active Extension Pattern) during static postures and dynamic activities. However, potential differences in muscle activity during functional tasks has not been established in these subgroups to date. A case-control study design recruited 50 NSCLBP subjects (27 Flexion Pattern, 23 Active Extension Pattern) and 28 healthy individuals. Surface electromyography determined muscle activity during functional tasks: reaching upwards, step-down, step-up, lifting and replacing a box, stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, bending to retrieve (and returning from retrieving) a pen from the floor. Normalised (\% sub-maximal voluntary contraction) mean amplitude electromyography of bilateral musculature (transversus abdominis/internal oblique, external oblique, superficial lumbar multifidus and longissimus thoracis) was analysed using Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests. Transversus abdominis/internal oblique activity was significantly increased in the Flexion Pattern group compared to controls during stand-to-sit (p = 0.009) on the left side only. External oblique activity was significantly greater in the Active Extension Pattern group compared to controls during box lift (p = 0.016) on the right side only. Significantly greater activity was identified in the right Superficial lumbar multifidus during step up (p = 0.029), reach up (p = 0.013) and box replace (p = 0.007) in the Active Extension Pattern group compared to controls. However left-sided superficial lumbar multifidus activity was significantly greater in the Flexion Pattern group (compared to controls) only during stand-to-sit (p = 0.009). No significant differences were observed in longissimus thoracis activity bilaterally during any task. No significant differences between NSCLBP subgroups were observed. Muscle activity in these NSCLBP subgroups appears to be highly variable during functional tasks with no clear pattern of activity identified. The findings reflect inconsistencies and variability in trunk muscle activity previously observed in these NSCLBP subgroups. Further work evaluating ratios of muscle activity and changes in muscle activity throughout task duration is warranted.}},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.}},

This study used contemporaneous quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) and surface electromyography (sEMG) to investigate relationships between continuous inter-vertebral motion variables and muscle electrical activity in the lumbar multifidus (LMU), lumbar and thoracic erector spinae (LES and TES) during standardised lumbar flexion and return in 18 healthy male human subjects. Our results demonstrated that the variability in the sharing of angular motion (i.e. Motion Share Variability MSV) and motion segment laxity during a bending task were significantly (p<0.05) negatively correlated (Spearman) with muscle electrical activity throughout the participant bend for both locally and globally acting muscle groups. MSV was also strongly correlated with L2-3 laxity. The former suggests a damping mechanism reducing irregular displacements (i.e. less variability in the sharing of segmental motion) during bending and an action of spinal stabilisation by muscles at segmental levels, and the latter a synergy between laxity at L2-3 and MSV. While this has previously been theorised, it has never been shown in vivo at the inter-vertebral level. These assessments may be considered for use in validation studies of exercise programs for CNSLBP, however further replication is required.}},

The aim of this study was to develop a reliable measurement technique for the assessment of lumbar spine kinematics using digital video fluoroscopy in a group of patients with low back pain (LBP) and a control group. Lumbar segmental instability (LSI) is one subgroup of nonspecific LBP the diagnosis of which has not been clarified. The diagnosis of LSI has traditionally relied on the use of lateral functional (flexion–extension) radiographs but use of this method has proven unsatisfactory. Fifteen patients with chronic low back pain suspected to have LSI and 15 matched healthy subjects were recruited. Pulsed digital videofluoroscopy was used to investigate kinematics of lumbar motion segments during flexion and extension movements in vivo. Intersegmental linear translation and angular displacement, and pathway of instantaneous center of rotation (PICR) were calculated for each lumbar motion segment. Movement pattern of lumbar spine between two groups and during the full sagittal plane range of motion were analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measures design. Intersegmental linear translation was significantly higher in patients during both flexion and extension movements at L5–S1 segment (p < 0.05). Arc length of PICR was significantly higher in patients for L1–L2 and L5–S1 motion segments during extension movement (p < 0.05). This study determined some kinematic differences between two groups during the full range of lumbar spine.

Two issues require consideration; first, the potential mechanisms for these changes in control, and secondly, the effect or outcome of changes in control for lumbopelvic function. Recent data indicate that experimentally induced pain may replicate some of the changes identified in people with LBP. While this does not exclude the possibility that changes in control of the trunk muscles may lead to pain, it does argue that, at least in some cases, pain may cause the changes in control. There are many possible mechanisms, including changes in excitability in the motor pathway, changes in the sensory system, and factors associated with the attention demanding, stressful and fearful aspects of pain. A new hypothesis is presented regarding the outcome from differential effects of pain on the elements of the motor system.

Recent cross-sectional studies have suggested a relationship between aberrant sensorimotor cortex activity and pain persistence. The UPWaRD (Understanding persistent Pain Where it ResiDes) cohort study is the first prospective, longitudinal investigation of sensorimotor cortex activity in low back pain. This paper describes the development of a causal model and statistical analysis plan for investigating the causal effect of sensorimotor cortex activity on the development of chronic low back pain. Sensorimotor cortex activity was assessed within 6 weeks of low back pain onset using somatosensory evoked potentials and transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping techniques. Chronic low back pain is defined as ongoing pain (Numerical Rating score ≥1) or disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score ≥3) at 6 months follow-up. Variables that could confound the relationship between sensorimotor cortex activity and chronic low back pain were identified using a directed acyclic graph and content expertise was used to specify known causal paths. The statistical model was developed ‘a priori’ to control for confounding variables identified in the directed acyclic graph, allowing an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of sensorimotor activity in acute low back pain on the development of chronic pain. The statistical analysis plan was finalised prior to follow-up of all participants and initiation of analysis.

  abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to review and summarize recent findings on electroencephalographic patterns in individuals with chronic pain. We also discuss recent advances in the use of quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG) for the assessment of pathophysiology and biopsychosocial factors involved in its maintenance over time. Data collection took place from February 2014 to July 2015 in PubMed, SciELO and PEDro databases. Data from cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies, as well as clinical trials involving chronic pain participants were incorporated into the final analysis. Our primary findings related to chronic pain were an increase of theta and alpha EEG power at rest, and a decrease in the amplitude of evoked potentials after sensory stimulation and cognitive tasks. This review suggests that qEEG could be considered as a simple and objective tool for the study of brain mechanisms involved in chronic pain, as well as for identifying the specific characteristics of chronic pain condition. In addition, results show that qEEG probably is a relevant outcome measure for assessing changes in therapeutic studies.}},

  abstract = {{Background and objectives: Low back pain is one of the most common health problems. In 85\% of cases, it is not possible to identify a specific cause, and it is therefore called Non-Specific Low Back Pain (NSLBP). Among the various attempted classifications, the subgroup of patients with impairment of motor control of the lower back (MCI) is between the most studied. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the results from trials about validity and reliability of clinical tests aimed to identify MCI in the NSLBP population. Materials and Methods: The MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and MedNar databases have been searched until May 2018. The criteria for inclusion were clinical trials about evaluation methods that are affordable and applicable in a usual clinical setting and conducted on populations aged > 18 years. A single author summarized data in synoptic tables relating to the clinical property; a second reviewer intervened in case of doubts about the relevance of the studies. Results: 13 primary studies met the inclusion criteria: 10 investigated inter-rater reliability, 4 investigated intra-rater reliability, and 6 investigated validity for a total of 23 tests (including one cluster of tests). Inter-rater reliability is widely studied, and there are tests with good, consistent, and substantial values (waiter’s bow, prone hip extension, sitting knee extension, and one leg stance). Intra-rater reliability has been less investigated, and no test have been studied for more than one author. The results of the few studies about validity aim to discriminate only the presence or absence of LBP in the samples. Conclusions: At the state of the art, results related to reliability support the clinical use of the identified tests. No conclusions can be drawn about validity.}},

In this Review, Kuner and Flor discuss how structural plasticity and reorganisation in somatosensory and emotional networks can contribute to chronic pain, integrating information available from animal models and human patients. Chronic pain is not simply a temporal continuum of acute pain. Studies on functional plasticity in neural circuits of pain have provided mechanistic insights and linked various modulatory factors to a change in perception and behaviour. However, plasticity also occurs in the context of structural remodelling and reorganisation of synapses, cells and circuits, potentially contributing to the long-term nature of chronic pain. This Review discusses maladaptive structural plasticity in neural circuits of pain, spanning multiple anatomical and spatial scales in animal models and human patients, and addresses key questions on structure–function relationships.}},

They facilitate tapping meaningfully into the complex, non-linear interactions that affect the brain and multiple systems of the body and promote adaptation or, when dysregulated, they can accelerate disease processes.

This is necessary in order to adequately describe and predict how an individual embedded in a particular social and physical environment, and with a unique genotype and set of lifetime experiences, will fare in terms of health and disease risk, as well as how that individual will respond to an intervention. Yet, at the same time, single biomarkers can have a predictive or diagnostic value when combined with carefully designed longitudinal assessment of behavior and disease related to stress. Moreover, the methods of brain imaging, themselves the reflection of the complexity of brain functional architecture, have provided new ways of diagnosing, and possibly differentiating, subtypes of depressive illness and anxiety disorders that are precipitated or exacerbated by stress. Furthermore, postmortem assessment of brain biomarkers provides important clues about individual vulnerability for suicide related to depression and this may lead to predictive biomarkers to better treat individuals with suicidal depression. Once biomarkers are available, approaches to prevention and treatment should take advantage of the emerging evidence that activating brain plasticity together with targeted behavioral interventions is a promising strategy.}},

Summary of Background Data. It has been well documented that many CLBP patients have motor control impairments of their lumbar spine. O’Sullivan proposed a mechanism-based classification system for NS-CLBP with motor control impairments based on a comprehensive subjective and physical examination to establish the relationship between pain provocation and spinal motor control. For the FP and AEP s, 2 groups defined by O’Sullivan and under investigation is this study, the motor control impairment is considered to be the mechanism maintaining their CLBP. No previous studies have used a Statistical Model with measurements of motor control impairment to subclassify NS-CLBP patients. Methods. Thirty-three NS-CLBP patients (20 FP and 13 AEP) and 34 asymptomatic subjects had synchronized lumbosacral kinematics and trunk muscle activation recorded during commonly reported aggravating postures and movements. Biomechanical variables were quantified and a Statistical Classification Model was developed. Results. The Statistical Model used 5 kinematic and 2 electromyography variables. The model correctly classified 96.4\% of cases. Conclusion. Selected biomechanical variables were predictors for subgroup membership and were able to discriminate the 3 subgroups. This study adds further support toward the validation of the proposed classification system.}},

Because of its availability and reasonable cost, two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopy has great potential as a diagnostic and evaluative tool. However, the technique of quantifying intervertebral motion in the lumbar spine must be validated, and the sensitivity assessed. The purpose of this investigation was to (1) compare synchronous fluoroscopic and optoelectronic measures of intervertebral rotations during dynamic flexion–extension movements in vitro and (2) assess the effect of C-arm rotation to simulate off-axis patient alignment on intervertebral kinematics measures. Six cadaveric lumbar–sacrum specimens were dissected, and active marker optoelectronic sensors were rigidly attached to the bodies of L2–S1. Fluoroscopic sequences and optoelectronic kinematic data (0.15-mm linear, 0.17–0.20 deg rotational, accuracy) were obtained simultaneously. After images were obtained in a true sagittal plane, the image receptor was rotated in 5 deg increments (posterior oblique angulations) from 5 deg to 15 deg. Quantitative motion analysis (qma) software was used to determine the intersegmental rotations from the fluoroscopic images. The mean absolute rotation differences between optoelectronic values and dynamic fluoroscopic values were less than 0.5 deg for all the motion segments at each off-axis fluoroscopic rotation and were not significantly different (P > 0.05) for any of the off-axis rotations of the fluoroscope. Small misalignments of the lumbar spine relative to the fluoroscope did not introduce measurement variation in relative segmental rotations greater than that observed when the spine and fluoroscope were perpendicular to each other, suggesting that fluoroscopic measures of relative segmental rotation during flexion–extension are likely robust, even when patient alignment is not perfect.}},

  abstract = {{Lumbar segmental instability is often considered to be a cause of chronic low back pain. However, defining its measurement has been largely limited to laboratory studies. These have characterised segmental stability as the intrinsic resistance of spine specimens to initial bending moments by quantifying the dynamic neutral zone. However these measurements have been impossible to obtain in vivo without invasive procedures, preventing the assessment of intervertebral stability in patients. Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF), measures the initial velocity of the attainment of intervertebral rotational motion in patients, which may to some extent be representative of the dynamic neutral zone. This study sought to explore the possible relationship between the dynamic neutral zone and intervertebral rotational attainment rate as measured with (QF) in an in vitro preparation. The purpose was to find out if further work into this concept is worth pursuing. This study used passive recumbent QF in a multi-segmental porcine model. This assessed the intrinsic intervertebral responses to a minimal coronal plane bending moment as measured with a digital force guage. Bending moments about each intervertebral joint were calculated and correlated with the rate at which global motion was attained at each intervertebral segment in the first 10° of global motion where the intervertebral joint was rotating. Unlike previous studies of single segment specimens, a neutral zone was found to exist during lateral bending. The initial attainment rates for left and right lateral flexion were comparable to previously published in vivo values for healthy controls. Substantial and highly significant levels of correlation between initial attainment rate and neutral zone were found for left (Rho = 0.75, P = 0.0002) and combined left-right bending (Rho = 0.72, P = 0.0001) and moderate ones for right alone (Rho = 0.55, P = 0.0012). This study found good correlation between the initial intervertebral attainment rate and the dynamic neutral zone, thereby opening the possibility to detect segmental instability from clinical studies. However the results must be treated with caution. Further studies with multiple specimens and adding sagittal plane motion are warranted.}},

  abstract = {{In order to improve understanding of the complex interactions between spinal sub-systems (i.e., the passive (ligaments, discs, fascia and bones), the active (muscles and tendons) and the neural control systems), it is necessary to take a dynamic approach that incorporates the measurement of multiple systems concurrently. There are currently no reviews of studies that have investigated dynamic sagittal bending movements using a combination of electromyography (EMG) and lumbar kinematic measurements. As such it is not clear how understanding of spinal stability concepts has advanced with regards to this functional movement of the spine. The primary aim of this review was therefore to evaluate how such studies have contributed to improved understanding of lumbar spinal stability mechanisms. PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched using combinations of the keywords related to spinal stability and sagittal bending tasks, using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Whilst examples of the interactions between the passive and active sub-systems were shown, typically small sample sizes meant that results were not generalizable. The majority of studies used regional kinematic measurements, and whilst this was appropriate in terms of individual study aims, the studies could not provide insight into sub-system interaction at the level of the spinal motion segment. In addition, the heterogeneity in methodologies made comparison between studies difficult. The review suggests that since Panjabi’s seminal spinal control papers, only limited advancement in the understanding of these theories has been provided by the studies under review, particularly at an inter-segmental level. This lack of progression indicates a requirement for new research approaches that incorporate multiple system measurements at a motion segment level.}},

  abstract = {{Background: Heart rate variability (HRV), the physiological variance in the heart's R-R interval length, can be analyzed to produce various parameters reflective of one's autonomic balance. HRV analysis may be used to capture those autonomic aberrations associated with chronic neuropathic pain (NP) in spinal cord injury (SCI). This study assesses the capacity of HRV parameters to diagnose NP in an SCI cohort. Methods: An electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected at rest from able bodied participants (AB, n = 15), participants with SCI only (SCI-NP, n = 11), and those with SCI and NP (SCI+NP, n = 20). HRV parameters were analyzed using conventional time and frequency analysis. Results: At rest, there were no heart rate differences amongst groups. However, SCI+NP participants demonstrated lower overall HRV, as determined by the SDNN time domain parameter, compared to either AB (p < 0.01) or SCI-NP (p < 0.05) groups. Moreover, AB and SCI-NP participants were statistically comparable for all HRV time and frequency domain parameters. Additional analyses demonstrated no differences in HRV parameters between T4, above vs. T5, below SCI groups (for all parameters: p > 0.15) or between C8, above vs. T1, below SCI groups (p > 0.30). Conclusions: Participants with SCI and NP exhibit a lower overall HRV, which can be determined by HRV time domain parameter SDNN. HRV analysis is an innovative modality with the capacity for objective quantification of chronic NP in participants with SCI.}},

Methods The 504 persons with chronic neck and low back pain filled out questionnaires assessing impairments in body functions and structures, limitations in activities of daily living, participation, and personal factors. Univariate analyzes were performed to investigate whether there are differences between individuals with and without kinesiophobia or not. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate whether independent variables were statistically significant predictors. Results In the univariate analyses, the persons who had high-level kinesiophobia had a significantly lower level of education and had significantly higher scores for the Million Visual Analogue Scale, Neck Disability Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Nottingham Health Profile (P < .001). In the final logistic regression analysis, only educational level (P = .01), Million Visual Analogue Scale (P = .002) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (P = .008, P = .012) were retained significantly as the predictors of kinesiophobia. Conclusion In this group of people with chronic neck and low back pain, educational level, low back pain-associated disability, and emotional states like depression and anxiety were associated with kinesiophobia.}},

Sleep habits are heritable, associated with brain function and structure, and intrinsically related to well-being, mental, and physical health. However, the biological basis of the interplay of sleep and health is incompletely understood. Here we show, by combining neuroimaging and behavioral genetic approaches in two independent large-scale datasets (HCP (n = 1106), age range: 22–37, eNKI (n = 783), age range: 12–85), that sleep, mental, and physical health have a shared neurobiological basis in grey matter anatomy; and that these relationships are driven by shared genetic factors. Though local associations between sleep and cortical thickness were inconsistent across samples, we identified two robust latent components, highlighting the multivariate interdigitation of sleep, intelligence, BMI, depression, and macroscale cortical structure. Our observations provide a system-level perspective on the interrelation of sleep, mental, and physical conditions, anchored in grey-matter neuroanatomy. Tahmasian et al. report that associations between sleep duration, intelligence, BMI, and depression are attributed to a shared macroscale brain-anatomy. They apply a comprehensive multivariate approach on two independent neuroimaging datasets and study shared heritability effects driving phenotypic associations in a twin-based sample.}},

This study investigated whether movement behaviour and tactile/pain sensation are related to M1 organisation in CLBP.Methods:Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to map the M1 representation of the erector spinae and multifidus muscles in 20 participants with and without CLBP. Cortical organisation was quantified by: map volume; center of gravity (CoG); number of peaks; and primary and secondary peak location. Movement behaviour was assessed as the ability to dissociate lumbar from thorax motion and sensory function as two-point discrimination, pressure pain thresholds, and pain intensity (visual analogue scale).Results:People with CLBP showed more anterior location of the CoG than controls. Map peaks were more numerous in CLBP participants who performed the movement task good than those with poor performance. In CLBP, smaller map volume correlated with greater pain during the movement task. Movement behaviour was not linearly correlated with M1 features.Conclusions:This study confirms that M1 maps differ between people with and without CLBP, but these changes are variable within the CLBP group and are not related to motor and sensory features in a simple manner.}},

Multichannel EEG recordings and pain ratings were obtained during the presentation of 800 painful electrical intramuscular and intracutaneous stimuli each to the left m. erector spinae and the left m. extensor digitorum. Perception and pain thresholds were not significantly different between the two groups, though patients showed significantly more perceptual sensitization. Across all stimulation conditions, a larger EEG component 80 milliseconds after stimulation was observed in the CLBP group. No significant group differences were found for the N150. The component 260 milliseconds after stimulus onset was significantly smaller in the CLBP group. N80, N150, and perceptual sensitization were significantly positively correlated. These results indicate enhanced perceptual sensitization and enhanced processing of the sensory-discriminative aspect of pain, as expressed in the N80 component, in CLBP patients. This may be one neurophysiologic basis of sensitization and the chronicity process. The lower P260 component in the patients may be explained in terms of tonic pain inhibiting phasic pain or may be related to the affective distress observed in this patient group.}},

  abstract = {{Using a technique of tracking intersegmental spine kinematics via skin surface markers, this study aimed to estimate local dynamic spine stability across smaller sub-regions (or segments) of the lumbar spine while also considering the impact of an external pelvic constraint during repetitive movements. Sixteen participants (10 males) performed two trials [Free Motion (FM), Pelvis Constrained (PC)] each consisting of 65 repetitive trunk flexion-extension movements to assess dynamic spine stability using maximum Lyapunov exponents (LyE). First, results indicated that LyE obtained from analysis of 30 repetitive flexion-extension movements did not differ from those obtained from analysis of greater numbers of repetitive movements, which aligns with results from a previous study for the whole lumbar spine. Next, for both males and females, and FM and PC trials, the most caudal region of the lumbar spine behaved the most dynamically stable, while upper lumbar regions behaved the most dynamically unstable. Finally, females demonstrated greater lumbar and intersegmental stability (lower LyE) during PC trials compared to FM, while males demonstrated slightly decreased lumbar and intersegmental stability (higher LyE) during PC trials compared to FM; this resulted in PC trials, but not FM trials, being different between sexes. Altogether, these data show that dynamic stability of lumbar spine sub-regions may be related to the proximity of the motion segment to rigid skeletal structures, and that consideration is needed when deciding whether to constrain the pelvis during analyses of dynamic spine stability.}},

The sheer volume and complexity of now available information can be overwhelming. We aimed to distil it into a form that facilitates comparison among diverse studies addressing spinal kinematics under healthy and degenerative conditions. We specifically aimed to define a baseline definition of the spectrum of normal spinal kinematics that in turn allows a comparable definition of kinematics of the degenerative lumbar spine. The considered data was obtained by a systematic MEDLINE search including studies on angular/translational segmental motion contribution, range of motion, coupling and center of rotation. As for degenerative conditions, we collected publications on disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, facet joint tropism, spondylolisthesis, ligament degeneration and paraspinal muscle degeneration. While we could demonstrate repeating motion patterns for some topics, agreement in other fields is limited due to methodological variances and small sample sizes, particularly in publications with highly accurate but complex techniques. Besides, the high frequency of concurrent degenerative processes complicates the association between diseases and subsequent kinematical changes. Despite several substantial gaps, we stand at the precipice of technological breakthroughs that can power future large-scale studies.}},

The effects of focussing attention on ankle passive movements were considered. Primary sensory (FSS1) and motor (FSM1) area activities were discriminated by the Functional Source Separation algorithm. Only contralateral FSS1 was recruited by common peroneal nerve stimulation and only contralateral FSM1 displayed coherence with TA muscular activity. FSM1 showed higher power of gamma rhythms (33–90 Hz) than FSS1. Both sources displayed higher beta (14–32 Hz) and gamma powers in the left than in the right hemisphere. Both sources displayed a bilateral reduction of beta power during IC-AM with respect to rest. Only FSS1 beta band power reduced during O-PM. No beta band modulation was observed of either source during NMES-PM. Mutual FSS1-FSM1 coherence in gamma2 band (61–90 Hz) showed a slight trend towards an increase when focussing attention during O-PM.

  abstract = {{The assessment of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) based on electrocardiograms (ECG) is considered a good proxy for stress in a wide range of animal species. However, problems can occur e.g., when measuring ECG in ambulatory settings such as recording of unrestrained animals using non‐invasive devices. Artefacts caused by technical (i.e. bad electrode contact) or physiological (i.e. ectopic beats, non‐cardiac muscle potentials) sources are common and can disturb the ECG signal. As HRV analysis is highly sensitive to artefacts in the interbeat interval (RR‐interval) time series the process of visual inspection of the raw signal to detect and correct these is essential. Most of the commercially available software requires intensive training and extensive manual work to accomplish this task and/or is often not available to access for free. EasieRR is an open‐source, stand‐alone software optimized for analysing ECG in non‐restrained animals. The program allows a species‐specific analysis and calculation of recommended standard HRV parameters in both, the time‐ and the nonlinear domain (RMSSD, SDNN, SD1 and SD2). Visualization of data using Poincaré plots and tachograms of RR‐intervals eases the validation of correct heart cycle interval detection and minimizes manual work for the user. Automatically detected peaks can be manually corrected via deletion, correction of spurious detections or marking of undetected peaks. The HRV analysis can be exported using common formats (TXT, MAT). Figures can be plotted and exported in various formats (PDF, SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EMF and EPS). Included in EasieRR is the possibility for synchronization of ECG data with video in order to link cardiac responses to specific behavioural responses. Die Analyse der Herzfrequenz (HF) und der Herzfrequenzvariabilität (HRV) aufgrund von Elektrokardiogrammen (EKG) kann zur Evaluation von Stress bei Tieren herangezogen werden. Fehlerhafter Hautkontakt der Messtechnik und Muskelpotentiale durch Bewegung können zu Artefakten im EKG und in Folge zu Fehlern im Tachogramm führen. Die visuelle Inspektion des EKG und eine anschließende Korrektur falsch detektierter QRS‐Komplexe ist daher unerlässlich, kann jedoch mit verfügbarer Software einen zeitaufwendigen Prozess darstellen. EasieRR ist eine benutzerfreundliche und frei‐zugängliche Software optimiert zur EKG‐Analyse am Tier. Das Programm ermöglich eine Art‐spezifische Analyse im zeitbasierten (mittlere HF, SD, RMSSD) und nicht‐linearen Bereich (SD1, SD2). Die Benutzeroberfläche von EasieRR kombiniert EKG und Tachogramm mit der Darstellung von Poincaré‐Plots und erleichtert somit das Auffinden von Artefakten, deren Korrektur und die HRV Analyse. Während der visuellen Inspektion als fehlerhaft erkannte R‐Zacken können manuell gelöscht, verschoben oder neu eingefügt werden. Die Ergebnisse der HRV‐Analyse können in gängigen Formaten (MAT, XLSX) exportiert werden und stehen für weitere statistische Anwendungen zur Verfügung. Grafiken können im Format PDF, SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EMF und EPS gesichert werden. EasieRR ermöglich auch die Synchronisation von Videoaufnahmen mit EKG‐Daten, und somit die Verknüpfung von Herzfrequenzparametern mit spezifischen Verhaltensweisen.}},

In order to clarify changes in corticomotor neurophysiology, APAs were assessed by using electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). An equal number (29) of nonspecific LBP patients and healthy subjects performed unilateral rapid arm movements in response to auditory imperative stimulus preceded by warning stimulus within 2 s interstimulus interval. Burst onset activity was calculated in relation to the activity of anterior deltoid for bilateral transverse abdominis/internal oblique (TrA/IO), and also postural muscles on left side, including rectus abdominis, external oblique (E.O), erector spinae and medial head of gastrocnemius (Gc.M). Contingent negative variation (CNV) potentials were recorded by scalp EEG, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was analyzed. In LBP patients, there was a significant onset delay for E.O and bilateral TrA/IO, but a significant earlier activity for Gc.M (for both P < 0.05). The CNV parameters were considerably greater in LBP patients (P < 0.01). The AUC was significant just for left TrA/IO and E.O muscles (P < 0.05). The CNV amplitudes were increased, and APA onset times re-organized to be delayed at the trunk and early at the distal limb in LBP cases. These findings support the hypothesis about reorganized activity of cerebral cortex in LBP patients.}},

Patients with CLBP have limited functioning and participation. Theoretically, physical functioning in patients with CLBP can plausibly be linked to CS; however, evidence to explain such association is scarce. Moreover, there is no gold standard for CS diagnosis. The objectives of the study are: (1) to analyse the association between instruments assessing reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS; (2) to analyse whether reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS are associated with functioning measurement outcomes; and (3) to analyse whether changes (between baseline and discharge) in reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS are related to changes in each of the functioning measurement outcomes. A cross-sectional and longitudinal observational study is performed with measurements taken at baseline and discharge of an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme. A sample size of 110 adult patients with CLBP has been calculated for the study. CS measurements are: Central Sensitisation Inventory, quantitative sensory testing and heart rate variability. Functioning measurements are: lifting capacity, maximal aerobic capacity, accelerometry and reported functioning. Statistical analyses to be performed are: (1) correlation between CS measurements, (2) multiple regression between functioning (dependent variable) and CS measurements (independent variable), and (3) multiple regression between changes in scores of functioning (dependent variable) and CS measurements (independent variable), and corrected for sex and age. The study obtained the clearance to its implementation from the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen in July 2017.

Prefrontal cortex regions are involved in executive functions and gait control and have been related to the performance of dual-tasks. Dual-task performance assessment may help identify older adults at risk of negative health outcomes. As an alternative to neuroimaging techniques that do not allow assessment during actual motion, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive technique that can assess neural activation through the measurement of cortical oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels, while the person is performing a motor task in a natural environment as well as during cognitive tasks. The aim of this review was to describe the use of fNIRS to study frontal lobe hemodynamics during cognitive, motor and dual-tasks in older adults. From the 46 included publications, 20 studies used only cognitive tasks, three studies used motor tasks and 23 used dual-tasks. Our findings suggest that fNIRS detects changes in frontal activation in older adults (cognitively healthy and mild cognitive impairment), especially while performing cognitive and dual-tasks. In both the comparison between older and younger adults, and in people with different neurological conditions, compared to healthier controls, the prefrontal cortex seems to experience a higher activation, which could be interpreted in the context of proposed neural inefficiency and limited capacity models. Further research is needed to establish standardized fNIRS protocols, study the cerebral hemodynamic in different neurological and systemic conditions that might influence cortical activation and explore its role in predicting incident health outcomes such as dementia.}},

  abstract = {{We propose a new conceptualization of pain by incorporating advancements made by phenomenologists and cognitive scientists. The biomedical understanding of pain is problematic as it inaccurately endorses a linear relationship between noxious stimuli and pain, and is often dualist or reductionist. From a Cartesian dualist perspective, pain occurs in an immaterial mind. From a reductionist perspective, pain is often considered to be “in the brain.” The biopsychosocial conceptualization of pain has been adopted to combat these problematic views. However, when considering pain research advancements, paired with the work of phenomenologists’ and cognitive scientists’ advanced understanding of perception, the biopsychosocial model is inadequate in many ways. The boundaries between the biological, psychological, and social are artificial, and the model is often applied in a fragmented manner. The model has a limited theoretical foundation, resulting in the perpetuation of dualistic and reductionist beliefs. A new framework may serve to better understand and treat pain. In this paper, we conceptualize pain as a 5E process, arguing that it is: Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, Emotive, and Extended. This perspective is applied using back pain as an exemplar and we explore potential clinical applications. With enactivism at the core of this approach, pain does not reside in a mysterious immaterial mind, nor is it an entity to be found in the blood, brain, or other bodily tissues. Instead, pain is a relational and emergent process of sense-making through a lived body that is inseparable from the world that we shape and that shapes us.}},

The assessment of higher order kinematics during complex movement tasks is the most highly researched and the most successful in describing differences between the populations. The use of simple end range of motion appears questionable, while assessing spinal proprioception is the least researched, yet shows potential in highlighting differences between low back sufferers and asymptomatics.ConclusionCurrent kinematic biomechanical assessment techniques are capable of identifying functional differences between low back pain populations and controls.

  abstract = {{Introduction. Lower back pain (LBP) is almost a problem of civilizations. Quite often, it is a consequence of many years of disturbed distribution of tension within the human body caused by local conditions (injuries, hernias, stenoses, spondylolisthesis, cancer, etc.), global factors (postural defects, structural integration disorders, lifestyle, type of activity, etc.), or systemic diseases (connective tissue, inflammation, tumours, abdominal aneurysm, and kidney diseases, including urolithiasis, endometriosis, and prostatitis). Therefore, LBP rehabilitation requires the use of integrated therapeutic methods, combining the competences of interdisciplinary teams, both in the process of diagnosis and treatment. Aim of the Study. Given the above, the authors of the article conducted meta-analysis of the literature in terms of integrated therapeutic methods, indicating the techniques focused on a holistic approach to the patient. The aim of the article is to provide the reader with comprehensive knowledge about treating LBP using noninterventional methods. Material and Methods. An extensive search for the materials was conducted online using PubMed, the Cochrane database, and Embase. The most common noninterventional methods have been described, as well as the most relevantly updated and previously referenced treatment of LBP. The authors also proposed noninvasive (measurable) diagnostic procedures for the functional assessment of the musculoskeletal system, including initial, systematic, and cross-sectional control. All figures and images have been prepared by the authors and are their property. Results. This review article goes beyond combining a detailed description of each procedure with full references, as well as a comprehensive discussion of this very complex and troublesome problem. Conclusions. Lower back pain is a serious health problem, and this review article will help educate physicians and physiotherapists dealing with LBP in the options of evidence-based treatment. Ultimately, the article introduces and postulates the need to systematize therapeutic procedures in LBP therapy, with a long-term perspective.}},

A notorious problem with EEG is that genuine cerebral data is often contaminated by artifacts of non-cerebral origin. Unfortunately, such artifacts tend to be exacerbated when the subject is in motion, meaning that obtaining reliable data during exercise is inherently problematic. These problems may explain the limited number of studies using EEG as a methodological tool in the sports sciences. This paper discusses how empirical studies have generally tackled the problem of movement artifact by adopting alternative paradigms which avoid recording during actual physical exertion. Moreover, the specific challenges that motion presents to obtaining reliable EEG data are discussed along with practical and computational techniques to confront these challenges. Finally, as EEG recording in sports is often underpinned by a desire to optimise performance, a brief review of EEG-biofeedback and peak performance studies is also presented. A knowledge of practical aspects of EEG recording along with the advent of new technology and increasingly sophisticated processing models offer a promising approach to minimising, if perhaps not entirely circumventing, the problem of obtaining reliable EEG data during motion.}},

Furthermore NP gel supports integration following injection into the disc and restores mechanical function to the disc. However, translation of this treatment strategy into clinical application is dependent on the survival and differentiation of hMSC to the correct cell phenotype within the degenerate intervertebral disc (IVD). Here, we investigated the viability and differentiation of hMSCs within NP gel within a catabolic microenvironment. hMSCs were encapsulated in NPgel and cultured for 4 weeks under hypoxia (5\% O2) with ± calcium, interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) either individually or in combination to mimic the degenerate environment. Cell viability and cellular phenotype were investigated. Stem cell viability was maintained within hydrogel systems for the 4 weeks investigated under all degenerate conditions. NP matrix markers: Agg and Col II and NP phenotypic markers: HIF‐1α, FOXF1, and PAX1 were expressed within the NPgel cultures and expression was not affected by culture within degenerate conditions. Alizarin red staining demonstrated increased calcium deposition under cultures containing CaCl2 indicating calcification of the matrix. Interestingly matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), ADAMTS 4, and Col I expression by hMSCs cultured in NPgel was upregulated by calcium but not by proinflammatory cytokines IL‐1β and TNFα. Importantly IL‐1β and TNFα, regarded as key contributors to disc degeneration, were not shown to affect the NP cell differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the NPgel. In agreement with our previous findings, NPgel alone was sufficient to induce NP cell differentiation of MSCs, with expression of both aggrecan and collagen type II, under both standard and degenerate culture conditions; thus could provide a therapeutic option for the repair of the NP during IVD degeneration. Translation of injectable hydrogel systems for delivery of MSCS are dependent on survival and differentiation to the correct cell phenotype within the degenerate intervertebral disc (IVD).

In this study, intervertebral motion in a lumbar motion segment, trunk flexion, and the electromyographic activity in the lumbar erector spinae muscles were simultaneously measured during dynamic flexion-extension in seven patients with chronic low back pain with symptoms suggesting segmental instability and in six asymptomatic controls. A linkage system, which attached directly to the spinous processes of a lumbar motion segment, was used to continuously measure the sagittal plane intervertebral motion, while a potentiometric goniometer measured trunk flexion; myoelectric activity was measured using surface electrodes. It was found that intervertebral motions, as well as trunk mobility, were significantly less in the patients, both in terms of range and pattern of motion. Flexion relaxation was demonstrated in the controls by a 78\% decrease in myoelectric activity at full flexion, whereas in the patients, only a 13\% reduction was found, with most of the patients experiencing no reduction at all. Flexion relaxation occurred only in subjects in whom intervertebral rotation had reached a stage of completion considerably before full trunk flexion was achieved. These findings suggest that persistent muscle activation, which restricts intervertebral motion, is a means by which the neuromuscular system provides stability to help protect diseased passive spinal structures from movements that may cause pain.}},

The lumbar segment of each subject was MRI-scanned to construct 3D models of the L2–S1 vertebrae. The lumbar spine was then imaged using a dual fluoroscopic imaging system as the subject performed a weight-lifting activity from a lumbar flexion position (45°) to maximal extension position. The 3D vertebral models and the fluoroscopic images were used to reproduce the in vivo vertebral positions along the motion path. The relative translations and rotations of each motion segment were analyzed. All vertebral motion segments, L2–3, L3–4, L4–5 and L5–S1, rotated similarly during the lifting motion. L4–5 showed the largest anterior-posterior (AP) translation with 2.9 ± 1.5 mm and was significantly larger than L5–S1 (p < 0.05). L5–S1 showed the largest proximal–distal (PD) translation with 2.8 ± 0.9 mm and was significantly larger than all other motion segments (p < 0.05).

The amplitude of motor evoked potentials (n=6) was averaged for each position.ResultsThe optimal site for evoking responses in the contralateral LP muscles was situated 1cm anterior and 4cm lateral to the vertex. Ipsilateral responses were evoked from sites lateral to the optimal site for evoking contralateral responses.

Anterior sites at which excitation can be evoked may indicate projections arising in the SMA are involved.SignificanceThis study provides normative data regarding the cortical representation of the paravertebral muscles and provides a technique for evaluating cortical motor plasticity in patients presenting with spinal pathologies.}},

The model generalizes ‘appraisal’ theories that view emotions as emerging from cognitive evaluations of physiological changes, and it sheds new light on the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie the experience of body ownership and conscious selfhood in health and in neuropsychiatric illness.}},

Researchers may conduct scoping reviews instead of systematic reviews where the purpose of the review is to identify knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify concepts or to investigate research conduct. While useful in their own right, scoping reviews may also be helpful precursors to systematic reviews and can be used to confirm the relevance of inclusion criteria and potential questions. Scoping reviews are a useful tool in the ever increasing arsenal of evidence synthesis approaches. Although conducted for different purposes compared to systematic reviews, scoping reviews still require rigorous and transparent methods in their conduct to ensure that the results are trustworthy. Our hope is that with clear guidance available regarding whether to conduct a scoping review or a systematic review, there will be less scoping reviews being performed for inappropriate indications better served by a systematic review, and vice-versa.}},

It is therefore frequently assessed in affected patients and commonly reported as the average amount of postural sway while standing upright under a variety of sensory conditions. These averaged linear outcomes, such as mean centre of pressure (CP) displacement or mean CP surface areas, may not reflect the true postural status. Adding nonlinear outcomes and multi-segmental kinematic analysis has been reported to better reflect the complexity of postural control and may detect subtler postural differences. In this cross-sectional study, a combination of linear and nonlinear postural parameters were assessed in patients with CNLBP (n = 24, 24-75 years, 9 females) and compared to symptom-free controls (CG, n = 34, 22-67 years, 11 females). Primary outcome was postural control measured by variance of joint configurations (uncontrolled manifold index, UI), confidence ellipse surface areas (CEA) and approximate entropy (ApEn) of CP dispersion during the response phase of a perturbed postural control task on a swaying platform. Secondary outcomes were segment excursions and clinical outcome correlates for pain and function. Non-parametric tests for group comparison with P-adjustment for multiple comparisons were conducted. Principal component analysis was applied to identify patterns of segmental contribution in both groups. CNLBP and CG performed similarly with respect to the primary outcomes. Comparison of joint kinematics revealed significant differences of hip (P < .001) and neck (P < .025) angular excursion, representing medium to large group effects (r′s = .36 − .51). Significant (P′s < .05), but moderate correlations of ApEn (r = -.42) and UI (r = -.46) with the health-related outcomes were observed. These findings lend further support to the notion that averaged linear outcomes do not suffice to describe subtle postural differences in CNLBP patients with low to moderate pain status.}},

However, recent studies have shown similar clinical outcomes after decompression alone, suggesting that a subset of DS patients may not require spinal fusion. Identification of dynamic instability could prove useful for predicting which patients are at higher risk of post-laminectomy destabilization necessitating fusion. The goal of this study was to determine if static clinical radiographs adequately characterize dynamic instability in patients with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) and to compare the rotational and translational kinematics in vivo during continuous dynamic flexion activity in DS versus asymptomatic age-matched controls. Seven patients with symptomatic single level lumbar DS (6 M, 1 F; 66 ± 5.0 years) and seven age-matched asymptomatic controls (5 M, 2 F age 63.9 ± 6.4 years) underwent biplane radiographic imaging during continuous torso flexion. A volumetric model-based tracking system was used to track each vertebra in the radiographic images using subject-specific 3D bone models from high-resolution computed tomography (CT). In vivo continuous dynamic sagittal rotation (flexion/extension) and AP translation (slip) were calculated and compared to clinical measures of intervertebral flexion/extension and AP translation obtained from standard lateral flexion/extension radiographs. Static clinical radiographs underestimate the degree of AP translation seen on dynamic in vivo imaging (1.0 vs 3.1 mm; p = 0.03). DS patients demonstrated three primary motion patterns compared to a single kinematic pattern in asymptomatic controls when analyzing continuous dynamic in vivo imaging. 3/7 (42\%) of patients with DS demonstrated aberrant mid-range motion. Continuous in vivo dynamic imaging in DS reveals a spectrum of aberrant motion with significantly greater kinematic heterogeneity than previously realized that is not readily seen on current clinical imaging.

At the same time, the autonomic nervous system is influenced by humoral effects, hemodynamic variables, respiratory rhythm, and stroke volume, among others. Furthermore, there exist feedback loops among these mechanisms influencing each other in a nonlinear way. A consequence of these nonlinear interactions is that heart rate modulation cannot be fully understood by studying its components in isolation. However, the study of the heart rhythm modulation as a whole is a formidable task. A more common approach in the literature, more modest than the full comprehension of the heart rate regulation system, is trying to quantify the complexity of heart rate using nonlinear statistics derived from the chaos theory or from fractal processes. In this chapter, we summarize the most widely used statistics based on nonlinear and fractal dynamics, and we show how to compute them with RHRV.}},

The intervertebral discs lie between the vertebral bodies, linking them together. The components of the disc are nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus and cartilagenous end-plates. The blood supply to the disc is only to the cartilagenous end-plates. The nerve supply is basically through the sinovertebral nerve. Biochemically, the important constituents of the disc are collagen fibers, elastin fibers and aggrecan. As the disc ages, degeneration occurs, osmotic pressure is lost in the nucleus, dehydration occurs, and the disc loses its height. During these changes, nociceptive nuclear material tracks and leaks through the outer rim of the annulus. This is the main source of discogenic pain. While this is occurring, the degenerative disc, having lost its height, effects the structures close by, such as ligamentum flavum, facet joints, and the shape of the neural foramina. This is the main cause of spinal stenosis and radicular pain due to the disc degeneration in the aged populations. Diagnosis is done by a strict protocol and treatment options are described in this review. The rationale for new therapies are to substitute the biochemical constituents, or augment nucleus pulposus or regenerate cartilaginous end-plate or finally artificial disc implantation. ▪.}},

  abstract = {{Many people with recurrent low back pain (LBP) have deficits in postural control of the trunk muscles and this may contribute to the recurrence of pain episodes. However, the neural changes that underlie these motor deficits remain unclear. As the motor cortex contributes to control of postural adjustments, the current study investigated the excitability and organization of the motor cortical inputs to the trunk muscles in 11 individuals with and without recurrent LBP. EMG activity of the deep abdominal muscle, transversus abdominis (TrA), was recorded bilaterally using intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. Postural control was assessed as onset of TrA EMG during single rapid arm flexion and extension tasks. Motor thresholds (MTs) for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were determined for responses contralateral and ipsilateral to the stimulated cortex. In addition, responses of TrA to TMS over the contralateral cortex were mapped during voluntary contractions at 10\% of maximum. MTs and map parameters [centre of gravity (CoG) and volume] were compared between healthy and LBP groups. The CoG of the motor cortical map of TrA in the healthy group was ∼2 cm anterior and lateral to the vertex, but was more posterior and lateral in the LBP group. The location of the CoG and the map volume were correlated with onset of TrA EMG during rapid arm movements. Furthermore, the MT needed to evoke ipsilateral responses was lower in the LBP group, but only on the less excitable hemisphere. These findings provide preliminary evidence of reorganization of trunk muscle representation at the motor cortex in individuals with recurrent LBP, and suggest this reorganization is associated with deficits in postural control.}},

In an effort to standardize reporting, we propose the Guidelines for Reporting Articles on Psychiatry and Heart rate variability (GRAPH), a checklist with four domains: participant selection, interbeat interval collection, data preparation and HRV calculation. This paper provides an overview of these four domains and why their standardized reporting is necessary to suitably evaluate HRV research in psychiatry and related disciplines.

This may be explained by the fact that only general measures of pain‐related fear have been used to examine the association with movement patterns. This study explored whether task‐specific, instead of general measures of pain‐related fear can predict movement behaviour. Fifty‐five patients with CLBP and 54 healthy persons performed a lifting task while kinematic measurements were obtained to assess lumbar range of motion (ROM). Scores on the Photograph Daily Activities Series‐Short Electronic Version (PHODA‐SeV), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia and its Activity Avoidance and Somatic Focus subscales were used as general measures of pain‐related fear. The score on a picture of the PHODA‐SeV, showing a person lifting a heavy object with a bent back, was used as task‐specific measure of pain‐related fear. Lumbar ROM was predicted by task‐specific, but not by general measures of pain‐related fear. Only the scores on one other picture of the PHODA‐SeV, similar to the task‐specific picture regarding threat value and movement characteristics, predicted the lumbar ROM. Compared to healthy persons, patients with CLBP used significantly less ROM, except the subgroup with a low score on the task‐specific measure of pain‐related fear, who used a similar ROM. Our results suggest to use task‐specific measures of pain‐related fear when assessing the relationship with movement. It would be of interest to investigate whether reducing task‐specific fear changes protective movement behaviour. This study shows that lumbar range of motion in CLBP is predicted by task‐specific, but not by general measures of pain‐related fear. This suggests that both in clinical practice and for research purposes, it might be recommended to use task‐specific measures of pain‐related fear when assessing the relationship with movement behaviour. This may help to disentangle the complex interactions between pain‐related fear, movement and disability in patients with CLBP.}},

  abstract = {{Control of the lumbar spine requires contributions from both the active and passive sub-systems. Identifying interactions between these systems may provide insight into the mechanisms of low back pain. However, as a first step it is important to investigate what is normal. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between the lumbar inter-vertebral range of motion and paraspinal muscle activity during weight-bearing flexion in healthy controls using quantitative fluoroscopy (QF) and surface electromyography (sEMG). Contemporaneous lumbar sEMG and QF motion sequences were recorded during controlled active flexion of 60° using electrodes placed over Longissimus thoracis pars thoracis (TES), Longissimus thoracis pars lumborum (LES), and Multifidus (LMU). Normalised root mean square (RMS) sEMG amplitude data were averaged over five epochs, and the change in amplitude between epochs was calculated. The sEMG ratios of LMU/LES LMU/TES and LES/TES were also determined. QF was used to measure the maximum inter-vertebral range of motion from L2-S1, and correlation coefficients were calculated between sEMG amplitude variables and these measurements. Intra- and inter-session sEMG amplitude repeatability was also assessed for all three paraspinal muscles. The sEMG amplitude measurements were highly repeatable, and sEMG amplitude changes correlated significantly with L4-5 and L5-S1 IV-RoMmax (r = −0.47 to 0.59). The sEMG amplitude ratio of LES/TES also correlated with L4-L5 IV-RoMmax (r = −0.53). The relationships found may be important when considering rehabilitation for low back pain.}},

  abstract = {{Various pain conditions may result in altered autonomic nervous system regulation. We evaluated whether autonomic regulation, analyzed with short-term heart rate variability (HRV), differs between low back pain (LBP) patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we tested if short-term HRV recordings are feasible and informative in planning home monitoring of LBP patients. The study population consisted of 16 volunteers (8 LBP patients and 8 healthy subjects) (age 42±10 years, body mass index 26±4 kg/m2, 7 men and 9 women). Usually 3-to 5-minute R-R interval recordings have been used as short-term recordings of HRV, but recent evidence supports even shorter R-R interval recording procedure for short-term HRV assessment. We collected R-R interval data for 1 minute in sitting, standing and bending down tasks. Mean heart rate (HR) and vagally mediated beat-to-beat variability (SD1 and rMSSD) were analyzed. The results showed that autonomic nervous system function assessed with the short-term measurement HRV method differentiates LBP patients from healthy controls in sitting and standing. Vagally mediated SD1 and rMSSD were significantly lower and the HR was higher among the patients compared to the controls. A novel finding was also the feasibility of 1-minute measurement of HRV, which may open entirely new opportunities to assess accurately concomitant changes in autonomic nervous system function and self-reported individual pain experience. This could lead to a more personalized pain treatment and more efficient health care resource allocation as the new measurement methods is more suitable for home monitoring than the previously used ones.}},

  doi = {10.1101/2020.04.01.20049999}, 
  abstract = {{There is a long-held belief that physical activities such as lifting with a flexed spine is generally harmful for the back and can cause low back pain (LBP), potentially nurturing fear avoidance beliefs underlying pain-related fear. In chronic LBP patients, pain-related fear has been shown to be associated with reduced lumbar range of motion during lifting, indicating distinct and probably protective psychomotor responses to pain. However, despite short term beneficial effects for tissue health, recent evidence suggests that maintaining a protective trunk movement strategy may also pose a risk for (persistent) LBP due to possible pro-nociceptive consequences of altered spinal kinematics, reflected by increased loading on lumbar tissues and persistent muscle tension. Yet, it is unknown if similar psychomotor interactions already exist in pain-free individuals which would yield potential insights into how a person might react when they experience LBP. Therefore, the aim of this study is to test the impact of pain-related fear on spinal kinematics in a healthy cohort of pain-free adults without a history of chronic pain. The study subjects (N=57) filled out several pain-related fear questionnaires and were asked to perform a lifting task (5kg-box). High-resolution spinal kinematics were assessed using an optical motion capturing system. Time-sensitive analyses were performed based on statistical parametric mapping. The results demonstrated time-specific and negative relationships between self-report measures of pain-related fear and lumbar spine flexion angles during lifting, yielding important implications regarding unfavorable psychomotor interactions that might become relevant in a future LBP incident. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Clinical Trial NCT03255616 \#\#\# Funding Statement This research was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF, Bern, Switzerland). \#\#\# Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

  abstract = {{Objectives Although treatment development in osteoarthritis (OA) focuses on chondroprotection, it is unclear how much preventing cartilage loss reduces joint pain. It is also unclear how nociceptive tissues may be involved. Methods Using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, we quantified the relation between cartilage loss and worsening knee pain after adjusting for bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and synovitis, and examined how much these factors mediated this association. 600 knee MRIs were scored at baseline, 12 months and 24 months for quantitative and semiquantitative measures of OA structural features. We focused on change in medial cartilage thickness using an amount similar to that seen in recent trials. Linear models calculated mean change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score with cartilage loss, adjusted for baseline BMLs, synovitis and covariates. Mediation analysis tested whether change in synovitis or BMLs mediated the cartilage loss–pain association. We carried out a subanalysis for knees with non-zero baseline WOMAC pain scores and another for non-valgus knees. Results Cartilage thickness loss was significantly associated with a small degree of worsening in pain over 24 months. For example, a loss of 0.1 mm of cartilage thickness over 2 years was associated with a 0.32 increase in WOMAC pain (scale 0–20). The association of cartilage thickness loss with pain was mediated by synovitis change but not by BML change. Subanalysis results were similar. Conclusions Cartilage thickness loss is associated with only a small amount of worsening knee pain, an association mediated in part by worsening synovitis. Demonstrating that chondroprotection reduces knee pain will be extremely challenging and is perhaps unachievable.}},

  abstract = {{ Background context The correlation between physical inactivity, thoracolumbar disc degeneration, and back pain remains unclear Purpose This study investigated the relationship between short- and long-term physical inactivity and degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine in a southern German cohort from the general population over a time period of 14 years. Study design / Setting This study was designed as a cross-sectional case-control study, nested in a prospective cohort from the “Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg/Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg” (KORA) study. Patient sample All participants in the population-based KORA study were assessed using a physical activity questionnaire to establish a baseline in 1999-2001 (exam 1), within an initial follow up questionnaire in 2006-2008 (exam 2) and a second follow-up questionnaire between 2013-2014 (exam 3). A sub-sample of this group (400 subjects) underwent full body MR scan performed on a 3T MRI scanner current with exam 3. Outcome Measure Data regarding physical inactivity over a time period of 14 years and back pain, and quantification of thoracic and lumbar disc degeneration on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Methods Quantification of thoracic and lumbar disc degeneration was performed using the Pfirrmann score. Physical activity was grouped as no physical activity, irregularly for 1 hour, regularly for 1 hour, or regularly for ≥2 hours. This was used to calculate another variable “physical inactivity”, with the options of irregular activity ≤1 hour per week or regularly ≥1 hour. Physical labor, walking, and cycling activity were additionally investigated. Correlations between physical inactivity measurements and thoracic and lumbar disc degeneration were analyzed via linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and back pain. Results In total, 385 individuals (mean age: 56 years, SD ± 9.19; 58.2\% male) were included in this study. Mean summed Pfirrmann score was 2.41 (SD ± 4.19) in the thoracic and 1.78 (SD ± 1.81) in the lumbar spine. The level of current exercise in our cohort varied with 113 (29.4\%) subjects exercising regularly ≥2 hours per week, 118 (30.7\%) regularly 1 hour per week, 57 (14\%) irregularly for about 1 hour per week, and 97 (25.2\%) stated not to exercise at exam 3. Disc degeneration was more apparent in those with irregular activity <1 hour compared to those with regular activity of ≥1 hour and more per week (p<0.01) and in those with no activity compared to those with regular activity of ≥2 (p<0.001) measured using exam 3. Less physical activity over a time period of 14 years correlated with an increase of disc degeneration of the thoracic and lumbar spine after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, hypertension and diabetes mellitus (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant association between physical labor, walking activity, or cycling activity with disc degeneration. Additionally, no significant correlations between degree of disc degeneration (p=0.990), degree of physical inactivity (p=0.158), and back pain were observed. Conclusion Degree of physical inactivity as measured over a time period of 14 years demonstrated a strong correlation with disc degeneration of the thoracic and lumbar spine.}},

J Strength Cond Res 32(3): 716–725, 2018—Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during exercise is an interesting noninvasive tool to measure the cardiovascular response to the stress of exercise. Wearable heart rate monitors are a comfortable option to measure interbeat (RR) intervals while doing physical activities. It is necessary to evaluate the agreement between HRV parameters derived from the RR series recorded by wearable devices and those derived from an electrocardiogram (ECG) during dynamic exercise of low to high intensity. Twenty-three male volunteers performed an exercise stress test on a cycle ergometer. Subjects wore a Polar RS800 device, whereas ECG was also recorded simultaneously to extract the reference RR intervals. A time–frequency spectral analysis was performed to extract the instantaneous mean heart rate (HRM), and the power of low-frequency (PLF) and high-frequency (PHF) components, the latter centered on the respiratory frequency. Analysis was done in intervals of different exercise intensity based on oxygen consumption. Linear correlation, reliability, and agreement were computed in each interval. The agreement between the RR series obtained from the Polar device and from the ECG is high throughout the whole test although the shorter the RR is, the more differences there are. Both methods are interchangeable when analyzing HRV at rest. At high exercise intensity, HRM and PLF still presented a high correlation (\&rgr; > 0.8) and excellent reliability and agreement indices (above 0.9). However, the PHF measurements from the Polar showed reliability and agreement coefficients around 0.5 or lower when the level of the exercise increases (for levels of O2 above 60\&percnt;).}},

Here we aimed to determine whether motor cortical reorganization in low back pain (LBP) can be identified using noninvasive surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings of back muscles at different lumbar levels, and whether cortical reorganization is related to clinical features of LBP. Summary of Background Data. Reorganization of motor regions of the brain may contribute to altered motor control, pain, and disability in chronic LBP. However, data have been limited by the need for invasive recordings of back muscle myoelectric activity. The relationship between altered cortical organization and clinical features of LBP remains unclear. Methods. In 27 individuals with recurrent, nonspecific LBP and 23 pain-free controls, we mapped the motor cortical representation of the paraspinal muscles using transcranial magnetic stimulation in conjunction with noninvasive surface EMG recordings at L3 and L5 levels. Clinical measures of pain severity, location, and duration were made. Results. The results demonstrate a loss of discrete motor cortical organization of the paraspinal muscles in chronic LBP that can be identified using noninvasive EMG recordings. A loss of discrete cortical organization was clearer when surface electrodes were positioned at L3 rather than L5. A novel finding was that altered motor cortical organization (number of discrete peaks and map volume) was associated with the severity and location of LBP. Conclusion. These data suggest that surface EMG positioned at L3 is appropriate for the identification of changes in the motor cortex in LBP. Furthermore, our data have implications for treatment strategies that aim to restore cortical organization in LBP. Level of Evidence: 2}},

Development of systems biology at the beginning of 21st century transformed biological science. Systems biology is a new holistic approach or strategy how to research biological organisms, developed through three phases. The first phase was completed when molecular biology transformed into systems molecular biology. Prior to the second phase, convergence between applied general systems theory and nonlinear dynamics took place, hence allowing the formation of systems mathematical biology. The second phase happened when systems molecular biology and systems mathematical biology, together, were applied for analysis of biological data. Finally, after successful application in science, medicine and biotechnology, the process of the formation of modern systems biology was completed.Systems and molecular reductionist views on organisms were completely opposed to each other. Implications of systems and molecular biology on reductionist–antireductionist debate were quite different. The analysis of reductionism, antireductionism and emergence issues, in the era of systems biology, revealed the hierarchy between methodological, epistemological and ontological antireductionism. Primarily, methodological antireductionism followed from the systems biology. Only after, epistemological and ontological antireductionism could be supported.}},

  abstract = {{Pain is a conscious experience, crucial for survival. To investigate the neural basis of pain perception in humans, a large number of investigators apply noxious stimuli to the body of volunteers while sampling brain activity using different functional neuroimaging techniques. These responses have been shown to originate from an extensive network of brain regions, which has been christened the Pain Matrix and is often considered to represent a unique cerebral signature for pain perception. As a consequence, the Pain Matrix is often used to understand the neural mechanisms of pain in health and disease. Because the interpretation of a great number of experimental studies relies on the assumption that the brain responses elicited by nociceptive stimuli reflect the activity of a cortical network that is at least partially specific for pain, it appears crucial to ascertain whether this notion is supported by unequivocal experimental evidence. Here, we will review the original concept of the "Neuromatrix" as it was initially proposed by Melzack and its subsequent transformation into a pain-specific matrix. Through a critical discussion of the evidence in favor and against this concept of pain specificity, we show that the fraction of the neuronal activity measured using currently available macroscopic functional neuroimaging techniques (e.g., EEG, MEG, fMRI, PET) in response to transient nociceptive stimulation is likely to be largely unspecific for nociception.}},

Lacking of the spatial information of muscle oxygenation will limit the exploration of the heterogeneity of muscle activities. In this study, a multichannel NIRS recording system was used to measure the muscle oxygenation with an attempt to simultaneously provide the temporal and spatial HBO and HBT concentration. In the experiment, the influences of four motor tasks, including active, passive, imaginary movement, and the control task (no movement), on muscle oxygenation were investigated in eight normal subjects. Our results showed that both amplitude and spatial heterogeneity associated with variation in muscle oxygenation during active and passive motor tasks were significantly different between the motor time and rest time (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the region where HBO concentration decreased during the active motor task was in accordance with the anatomical position of contracted muscle, which cannot be observed from the results of the passive task. Considering the imaginary and control tasks in which the muscle was in a fixed/stationary state, the amplitude and spatial heterogeneity associated with variations in muscle oxygenation only exhibited slight changes (P > 0.05). This pilot study suggested that the spatiotemporal information obtained from multichannel NIRS devices might be potential for accurate measurement of the variation in muscle oxygenation during motor tasks, which would be useful for different clinical applications.}},

In the brain the experience of pain is associated with neuronal oscillations and synchrony at different frequencies. However, an overarching framework for the significance of oscillations for pain remains lacking. Recent concepts relate oscillations at different frequencies to the routing of information flow in the brain and the signaling of predictions and prediction errors. The application of these concepts to pain promises insights into how flexible routing of information flow coordinates diverse processes that merge into the experience of pain. Such insights might have implications for the understanding and treatment of chronic pain.}},

This manuscript presents a systematic meta-analytic review of studies examining SEMG differences between these groups. Forty-four articles were identified using MEDLINE and a review of reference lists in articles. For static SEMG, the largest effect size was observed for SEMG while standing, with subjects having LBP demonstrating higher SEMG. The effect size for flexion/relaxation measures was found to be very high (d = −1.71). Studies examining SEMG during isometric exercise or muscle recovery following exercise produced inconsistent findings. Sensitivity and specificity of SEMG for dynamic SEMG measures averaged 88.8\% and 81.3\%. Most classification schemes were statistically determined and utilized a combination of measures. Only one published study prospectively validated a classification scheme. SEMG measures of flexion-relaxation appear to distinguish LBP subjects from controls with good accuracy, and the sensitivity and specificity of SEMG can be increased by using multiple measures. Further research is needed to determine the combination of measures that are cost-effective, reliable, valid and discriminate with a high degree of accuracy between healthy persons and those with LBP.PerspectiveSEMG is a simple and noninvasive measure of muscle activity. SEMG measures hold promise as an objective marker of LBP.}},

We often cannot identify mechanisms to explain the major negative impact cLBP has on patients' lives. Such cLBP is often termed non-specific and may be due to multiple biologic and behavioral etiologies. Researchers use varied inclusion criteria, definitions, baseline assessments, and outcome measures, which impede comparisons and consensus. Therefore, NIH Pain Consortium charged a Research Task Force (RTF) to draft standards for research on cLBP. The resulting multidisciplinary panel recommended using 2 questions to define cLBP; classifying cLBP by its impact (defined by pain intensity, pain interference, and physical function); use of a minimum dataset to describe research participants (drawing heavily on the PROMIS methodology); reporting "responder analyses" in addition to mean outcome scores; and suggestions for future research and dissemination. The Pain Consortium has approved the recommendations, which investigators should incorporate into NIH grant proposals. The RTF believes that these recommendations will advance the field, help to resolve controversies, and facilitate future research addressing the genomic, neurologic, and other mechanistic substrates of chronic low back pain. We expect that the RTF recommendations will become a dynamic document and undergo continual improvement.}},

Thirteen subjects with chronic, recurrent, non-specific LBP and 13 subjects without LBP participated. The subjects responded to unpredictably timed postural perturbations while standing on a platform that randomly rotated either “toes up” or “toes down”. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to calculate the negative peak (N1) and subsequent positive peak (P2) amplitudes of the perturbation-evoked cortical potentials. Passive-marker motion capture was used to calculate joint and center-of-mass (CoM) displacements. Surface electromyography was used to record muscle onset latencies. Questionnaires assessed pain, interference with activity, fear of activity, and pain catastrophizing. Results demonstrated that subjects with LBP exhibited significantly larger P2 potentials, delayed erector spinae, rectus abdominae, and external oblique onset latencies, as well as smaller trunk extension yet larger trunk flexion, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion displacements compared to subjects without LBP. For the subjects with LBP, CoM displacements significantly and positively correlated with knee displacements as well as activity interference and fear scores. The P2 potentials significantly and negatively correlated with CoM displacements as well as activity interference, catastrophizing, and fear scores. These results demonstrate that people with LBP exhibit altered late-phase cortical processing of postural perturbations concomitant with altered kinematic and muscle responses, and these cortical and postural response characteristics correlate with each other as well as with clinical reports of pain-related fears and activity interference.}},

This terminology also serves as a foundation for the design of studies that evaluate the technical performance of quantitative imaging biomarkers and for studies of algorithms that generate the quantitative imaging biomarkers from clinical scans. This paper provides examples of research studies and quantitative imaging biomarker claims that use terminology consistent with these definitions as well as examples of the rampant confusion in this emerging field. We provide recommendations for appropriate use of quantitative imaging biomarker terminological concepts.

  abstract = {{Background: Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and chronic whiplash associated disorders (cWAD) present a reduced ability to activate central descending nociceptive inhibition after exercise, compared to measurements before exercise. It was hypothesised that a dysfunctional motor-induced inhibition of nociception partly explains this dysfunctional exercise-induced hypoalgesia. This study investigates if engagement of the motor system during movement preparation inhibits nociception-evoked brain responses in these patients as compared to healthy controls (HC). Methods: The experiment used laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) during three conditions (no task, mental task, movement preparation) while recording brain activity with a 32-channel electroencephalogram in 21 patients with cWAD, 20 patients with CFS and 18 HC. Two-factor mixed design Analysis of variance were used to evaluate differences in LEP amplitudes and latencies. Results: No differences in N1, N2, N2P2, and P2 LEP amplitudes were found between the HC, CFS, and cWAD groups. After nociceptive stimulation, N1, N2 (only at hand location), N2P2, and P2 LEP amplitudes significantly decreased during movement preparation compared to no task (within group differences). Conclusion: Movement preparation induces a similar attenuation of LEPs in patients with CFS, patients with cWAD and HC. These findings do not support reduced motor-induced nociceptive inhibition in these patients.}},

Systemic inflammation is observed in chronic LBP and may contribute to the transition from acute to persistent LBP. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether changes present early or develop over time. Psychological and/or sleep-related factors may be related. Individuals within 2 weeks of onset of acute LBP (N = 109) and pain-free controls (N = 55) provided blood for assessment of CRP, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β, and completed questionnaires related to pain, disability, sleep, and psychological status. LBP participants repeated measurements at 6 months. Biomarkers were compared between LBP and control participants at baseline, and in longitudinal (baseline/6 months) analysis, between unrecovered (≥pain and disability), partially recovered (reduced pain and/or disability) and recovered (no pain and disability) participants at 6 months. We assessed baseline patterns of inflammatory, psychological, sleep, and pain data using hierarchical clustering and related the clusters to recovery (\% change in pain) at 6 months. CRP was higher in acute LBP than controls at baseline. In LBP, baseline CRP was higher in the recovered than non-recovered groups. Conversely, TNF was higher at both time-points in the non-recovered than recovered groups. Two sub-groups were identified that associated with more (“inflammatory/poor sleep”) or less (“high TNF/depression”) recovery. This is the first evidence of a relationship between an “acute-phase” systemic inflammatory response and recovery at 6 months. High inflammation (CRP/IL-6) was associated with good recovery, but specific elevation of TNF, along with depressive symptoms, was associated with bad recovery. Depression and TNF may have a two-way relationship. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.}},

  abstract = {{ High-density surface electromyography (HDEMG) is an electrophysiological technique that can be used to quantify the spatial distribution of activity within muscles. When pain-free individuals perform sustained or repetitive tasks, different regions within a muscle become progressively more active; this is thought to reflect a strategy to redistribute the load to different regions, thus limiting localised muscle fatigue. The use of HDEMG has revealed that when people with musculoskeletal pain perform the same tasks, the distribution of activity within the same muscle is usually different, and the same muscle region tends to be active throughout the whole task without progressive activation of different muscle regions. This potentially results in a focal overload of a muscle region, and may contribute to fatigue, localised muscle pain and potentially pain persistence and/or recurrence over time. Interestingly, not all patients with musculoskeletal pain present with this regional alteration in muscle activation, reflecting the heterogeneity of patient presentations. This article will briefly review the technique of HDEMG followed by a review of studies demonstrating spatial redistribution of muscle activity in asymptomatic people during both isometric and dynamic conditions, including functional tasks. Lastly, the article will provide a review of HDEMG studies with a focus on changes in the behaviour of the lumbar erector spine and upper trapezius in people with spinal pain. These studies have revealed subtle changes in the distribution of muscle activity in people with spinal pain, which may have relevance for onset, persistence or recurrence of symptoms and could become a target of novel therapeutic approaches.}},

Identifying normal motion within an individual is complicated by the considerable variation in movement patterns amongst healthy individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize sources of variation in spine motion among a sample of healthy participants. The second objective of this study was to develop a multivariate model capable of predicting an expected movement pattern for an individual. The kinematic shape of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine was recorded during a constrained dynamic trunk flexion movement; as this is not a normal everyday movement task, movements are considered ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ for this task rather than ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’. Variations in neutral standing posture accounted for 85\% of the variation in spine motion throughout the task. Differences in total spine range of flexion and a regional re-weighting of range of motion between lower thoracic and lumbar regions explained a further 9\% of the variance among individuals. The analysis also highlighted a difference in temporal sequencing of motion between lower thoracic and lumbar regions which explained 2\% of the total movement variation. These identified sources of variation were used to select independent variables for a multivariate linear model capable of predicting an individuals’ expected movement pattern. This was done as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how the error between predicted and observed motion patterns could be used to differentiate between ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ movement strategies.}},

Tracked lumbar vertebral (L2-S1) motion data were processed into highly accurate 6DOF intervertebral (L2L3, L3L4, L4L5, L5S1) kinematics. ICRs were computed using the finite helical axis method. Effects of segment level and load magnitude on the anterior-posterior (AP) and superior-inferior (SI) ICR migration ranges were assessed with a mixed-effects model. Further, ICRs were averaged to a single center of rotation (COR) to assess segment-specific differences in COR AP- and SI-coordinates. The AP range was found to be significantly larger for L2L3 compared to L3L4 (p=0.02), L4L5 and L5S1 (p<0.001). Average ICR SI location was relatively higher – near the superior endplate of the inferior vertebra – for L4L5 and L5SI compared to L2L3 and L3L4 (p≤0.001) – located between the mid-transverse plane and superior endplate of the inferior vertebra – but differences were not significant amongst themselves (p>0.9). Load magnitude had a significant effect only on the SI component of ICR migration range (13.5kg>9kg and 4.5kg; p=0.049 and 0.017 respectively). The reported segment-specific ICR data exemplify improved input parameters for lumbar spine biomechanical models and design of disc replacements, and base-line references for potential diagnostic applications.}},

  abstract = {{EEG involves the recording, analysis, and interpretation of voltages recorded on the human scalp which originate from brain gray matter. EEG is one of the most popular methods of studying and understanding the processes that underlie behavior. This is so, because EEG is relatively cheap, easy to wear, light weight and has high temporal resolution. In terms of behavior, this encompasses actions, such as movements that are performed in response to the environment. However, there are methodological difficulties which can occur when recording EEG during movement such as movement artifacts. Thus, most studies about the human brain have examined activations during static conditions. This article attempts to compile and describe relevant methodological solutions that emerged in order to measure body and brain dynamics during motion. These descriptions cover suggestions on how to avoid and reduce motion artifacts, hardware, software and techniques for synchronously recording EEG, EMG, kinematics, kinetics, and eye movements during motion. Additionally, we present various recording systems, EEG electrodes, caps and methods for determinating real/custom electrode positions. In the end we will conclude that it is possible to record and analyze synchronized brain and body dynamics related to movement or exercise tasks.}},

The aims of this study were to characterize differences in sensorimotor functional connectivity in individuals with NSLBP and to investigate whether the patterns of sensorimotor functional connectivity underlie the impaired STSTS performance. Seventeen individuals with NSLBP and 17 healthy controls were instructed to perform five consecutive STSTS movements as fast as possible. Based on the center of pressure displacement, the total duration of the STSTS task was determined. In addition, resting-state functional connectivity images were acquired and analyzed on a multivariate level using both functional connectivity density mapping and independent component analysis. Individuals with NSLBP needed significantly more time to perform the STSTS task compared to healthy controls. In addition, decreased resting-state functional connectivity of brain areas related to the integration of sensory and/or motor information was shown in the individuals with NSLBP. Moreover, the decreased functional connectivity at rest of the left precentral gyrus and lobule IV and V of the left cerebellum was associated with a longer duration of the STSTS task in both individuals with NSLBP and healthy controls. In summary, individuals with NSLBP showed a reorganization of the sensorimotor network at rest, and the functional connectivity of specific sensorimotor areas was associated with the performance of a dynamic sensorimotor task.}},

  abstract = {{Compression of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles is reported to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain. The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment. The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P < 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P < 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P < 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P < 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P < 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P < 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P < 0.05). The results suggest that MTrP compression at the lumbar muscle modulates pPFC activity and functional connectivity between the pPFC and insula, which may relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain.

  abstract = {{Objectives: Pain assessment is enigmatic. Although clinicians and researchers must rely upon observations to evaluate pain, the personal experience of pain is fundamentally unobservable. This raises the question of how the inherent subjectivity of pain can and should be integrated within assessment. Current models fail to tackle key facets of this problem, such as what essential aspects of pain are overlooked when we only rely on numeric forms of assessment, and what types of assessment need to be prioritized to ensure alignment with our conceptualization of pain as a subjective experience. We present the multimodal assessment model of pain (MAP) as offering practical frameworks for navigating these challenges. Methods: This is a narrative review. Results: MAP delineates qualitative (words, behaviors) and quantitative (self-reported measures, non–self-reported measures) assessment and regards the qualitative pain narrative as the best available root proxy for inferring pain in others. MAP offers frameworks to better address pain subjectivity by: (1) delineating separate criteria for identifying versus assessing pain. Pain is identified through narrative reports, while comprehensive assessment is used to infer why pain is reported; (2) integrating compassion-based and mechanism-based management by both validating pain reports and assessing underlying processes; (3) conceptualizing comprehensive pain assessment as both multidimensional and multimodal (listening/observing and measuring); and (4) describing how qualitative data help validate and contextualize quantitative pain measures. Discussion: MAP is expected to help clinicians validate pain reports as important and legitimate, regardless of other findings, and help our field develop more comprehensive, valid, and compassionate approaches to assessing pain.}},

  abstract = {{This study aimed to quantify the effect of spinal manipulative treatment (SMT) from an analysis of baroreflex, systolic blood pressure and heart rate variability (HRV) on patients with acute back pain. It was hypothesized that SMT would increase the parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic control. Twenty-two patients with acute back pain were randomly divided into two groups: one receiving sham treatment (Sham) and the other receiving SMT. Recordings were completed during the first day and the seventh day, immediately before and after treatment on both days. ECG and systolic blood pressure were continuously recorded to compute cardiovascular variability and baroreflex sensitivity components. The perceived level of pain was measured with the numeric pain scale (NPS) 48 h before, just before and just after each treatment. The NPS ranged from 0 to 100\% (peak of pain before treatment). ECG and systolic blood pressure recordings were analyzed in time frequency domain using the Smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution. Root mean square of the successive differences, high frequency power of the heart rate variability, and high frequency baroreflex sensitivity differences between post and pre tests were higher in the SMT group than in the Sham group (p < 0.01), whereas no differences were observed with the other heart rate variability components. Also, no differences were observed with the systolic blood pressure components. Although the estimated pain scale values decreased over time, no difference was observed between the SMT and Sham groups. This seems to be the first study to assess the effect of SMT on both heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity in patients with acute back pain. SMT can be seen to provoke an increase in parasympathetic control known to relate to a person’s healthy state. Thus, cardiovascular variability analysis may be a useful tool for clinicians to quantify and objectify the beneficial effects of spinal manipulation treatment.}},

The primary goal of the present study was to assess if experimental capsaicin-induced low back pain (LBP) affects spine stability and the neuromuscular control of repetitive trunk movements in a group of healthy participants with no history of LBP. Fourteen healthy males were recruited for this investigation. Each participant was asked to complete three trials (baseline, in pain, and recovery) of 35 cycles of a repetitive trunk flexion/extension task at a rate of 0.25 Hz. Local dynamic stability and the muscular contributions to lumbar spine rotational stiffness were significantly impaired during the LBP trial compared to the baseline trial (p < 0.05); however, there was a trend for these measures to recover after a 1 h rest. This study provides evidence that capsaicin can effectively induce LBP, thereby altering spine rotational stiffness and local dynamic stability. Future research should directly compare the effects capsaicin-induced LBP and intramuscular/intraligamentous induced LBP on these same variables.}},

The current study presents an in vivo analysis of the morphometry and deformation of lumbar (L2-S1) intervertebral discs in 10 healthy participants while performing a common lifting act, using novel dynamic radiographic imaging of the lumbar vertebral body motion. Data analyses show uniquely different (p < 0.05) characteristics in morphometry, normal and shear strain patterns of the L5S1 discs, while the rest of lumbar discs exhibit great similarity. In particular shear strains in L2-L5 discs exhibited stronger linear correlations (R2 ≥ 0.80) between strain changes and amount of lumbar flexion-extension motion compared to L5S1 (R2 ≤ 0.5). The study therefore advances the state of knowledge on in vivo mechanical responses of the lumbar intervertebral discs during functional tasks.}},

Previous studies using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) systems have reported improved image quality over sparse arrays. These HD-DOT systems incorporated multidistance overlapping continuous wave measurements that only recover differential intensity attenuation. We investigate the potential improvement in reconstructed image quality due to the additional incorporation of phase shift measurements, which reflect the time-of-flight of the measured NIR light, within the tomographic reconstruction from high-density measurements. To evaluate image reconstruction with and without the additional phase information, we simulated point spread functions across a whole-scalp field of view in 24 subject-specific anatomical models using an experimentally derived noise model. The addition of phase information improves the image quality by reducing localization error by up to 59\% and effective resolution by up to 21\% as compared to using the intensity attenuation measurements alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phase data enable images to be resolved at deeper brain regions where intensity data fail, which is further supported by utilizing experimental data from a single subject measurement during a retinotopic experiment.}},
