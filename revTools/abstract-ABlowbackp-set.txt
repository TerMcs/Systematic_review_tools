OBJECTIVES: Tuberculous spondylitis (TS), also known as Pott's disease (PD), is 
a form of tuberculosis in which the vertebral column is affected. Since the 
first description by Katz et al. in 1992, it became clear that Bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillations in the treatment of superficial transitional 
cell carcinoma (TCC) form a plausible way in which PD is introduced. Nowadays, 
BCG forms the most effective treatment modality for superficial TCC. The 
incidence of other than minor complications have been estimated under five per 
cent. Here we report a case of TS after BCG-instillation in the treatment of 
TCC. Furthermore, all available literature concerning this topic was gathered 
into a systematic review. The primary objective was to create an overview of all 
available literature concerning TS after intravesical BCG-instillations, with an 
emphasis on the neurosurgical approach of these patients, forming a scaffold at 
which future case reports can be compared. As a secondary objective, we tried to 
raise the awareness concerning this very rare complication of intravesical 
BCG-instillation as a possible cause of low back pain (LBP).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review, in which patients who 
developed TS after intravesical BCG-therapy in the treatment of TCC, were 
examined. A total of twenty-three articles (twenty-four cases) obtained from 
MEDLINE were included. Search terms included: "tuberculous spondylitis", "Pott's 
disease", "vertebral osteomyelitis", "intravesical", "Bacillus Calmette-Guérin" 
and "transitional cell carcinoma". Additional studies were identified by 
checking reference lists. Furthermore, we present a case concerning one of our 
own patients who consulted our Neurosurgical department with a similar clinical 
presentation. This systematic review is in conformity with the 
PRISMA-guidelines. The case report is in accordance with the CARE statement 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Results are based on twenty-five cases (twenty-four cases extracted 
from previous literature and our case report). All included articles are case 
reports written in English. Publication year and recruitment time varies from 
1992 to 2018. Mean age at clinical presentation varies from 35 to 94 years old 
(mean 74). All patients were male. Surgery was performed in 17 out of 25 cases 
(68%). A posterior approach was performed in seven cases (41%), zero anterior 
approaches (0%), a combined approach in five cases (29%) and not specified in 
five cases (29%). All patients received intravesical BCG-instillation in the 
treatment of TCC, ranging from one month to twelve years before clinical 
presentation (mean 26). Radiographic abnormalities were seen in thoracic 
vertebral segments in thirteen cases (52%), eleven cases in lumbar segments 
(44%), one at the thoracolumbar transition level (4%) and not in cervical 
vertebral segments.
CONCLUSION: Although very rare, TS should be part of the differential diagnosis 
in patients with LBP, even years after BCG-instillation for TCC. It mostly 
affects elderly men and involves the thoracolumbar spine through hematogenous 
spread via Batson's plexus. Antitubercular therapy remains the mainstay in the 
treatment of TS. A posterior surgical approach, with debridement and 
stabilization, should be preferred when surgical intervention seems necessary. 
To our knowledge, this systematic review forms one of the first comprehensive 
reviews evaluating neurosurgical intervention for PD following intravesical 
BCG-therapy in the treatment of TCC.

OBJECTIVES: The presence of postinstrumentation back pain in patients after 
undergoing spinal surgery is a well established phenomenon. So too is the 
presence of infection, both overt and subclinical which can be a source of pain. 
The accurate assessment of infection in patients with spinal implants in situ 
and no overt radiological or biochemical abnormalities frequently presents a 
diagnostic challenge. We present our experience spanning 5 years of using 
2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F FDG 
PET)-computed tomography (CT) scans to aid the diagnostic process in treating 
presumed low-grade chronic implant infection.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective analysis of all patients with spinal 
implants in place who were referred for 18F FDG PET-CT imaging over a 5-year 
period. All available images, case notes and laboratory results were reviewed.
RESULTS: Data pertaining to 49 patients were analysed, with infection diagnosed 
on 18F FDG PET-CT in 24 (45%) of those sent for scanning. Fifteen patients in 
the cohort underwent revision surgery, and 11 of whom had been diagnosed as 
infected on PET-CT. Confirmation of infection with positive microbiological 
sampling occurred in 8/11 giving a positive predictive value of 0.72 in our 
series.
CONCLUSION: We present a real-world experience of using 18F FDG PET-CT as a 
diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with chronic pain after undergoing 
spinal implantation. We have found PET-CT to be a promising modality and would 
recommend multicentre collaboration to ensure reproducibility across more 
centres.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The neurophysiological effects of pediatric concussion 
several years after injury remain inadequately characterized. The objective of 
this study was to determine if a history of concussion was associated with BOLD 
response differences during an n-back working memory task in youth.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional.
METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Participants include 52 children and adolescents 
(M = 15.1 years, 95%CI = 14.4-15.8, range = 9-19) with past concussion (n = 33) 
or orthopedic injury (OI; n = 19). Mean time since injury was 2.5 years 
(95%CI = 2.0-3.0). Measures included postconcussion symptom ratings, 
neuropsychological testing, and blood-oxygen-dependent-level (BOLD) functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an n-back working memory task.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Groups did not differ on accuracy or speed during the 
three n-back conditions. They also did not differ in BOLD signal change for the 
1- vs. 0-back or 2- vs. 0-back contrasts (controlling for task performance).
CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support group differences in BOLD response 
during an n-back working memory task in youth who are on average 2.5 years 
post-concussion. The findings are encouraging from the perspective of 
understanding recovery after pediatric concussion.

We present the case of a man who presented with severe left lower back pain 
radiating to the anterior aspect of left thigh. He also had fever and headache. 
Due to the exquisite tenderness along the inguinal region, the possibility of a 
psoas abscess was considered. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and thigh 
were performed. These revealed left psoas muscle abnormalities suggestive of an 
evolving myositis or abscess. However, the next day, he displayed florid rashes 
in the left L2-L3 dermatomes consistent with herpes zoster. The clinical 
manifestations of herpes zoster include neuralgic pain and dermatomal skin 
rashes. It also presents with a prodrome of fever, headache, myalgia, myositis 
and Guillain-Barré syndrome. In a developing embryo, somites split to form 
dermatomes, myotomes (skeletal muscles), syndetomes (tendons and cartilage) and 
sclerotomes (bones). Our case illustrates that herpes zoster can involve the so 
called 'dermomyotome', a combination of the dermatome and myotome and result in 
a localised dermatomyositis.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the prevalence of reported musculoskeletal 
abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pediatric spine.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Back pain is a common complaint and significant 
health issue, already in children. Several studies have investigated 
musculoskeletal abnormalities of the pediatric spine as possible cause of low 
back pain (LBP). However, it is not clear which abnormalities are the most 
prevalent among children.
METHODS: A systematic literature search on the prevalence of musculoskeletal 
spinal abnormalities on MRI in children was conducted in the Embase, Medline 
Ovid and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Risk of bias was assessed using a checklist 
based on the Downs and Black checklist. General information on study and patient 
characteristics and the prevalence of spinal abnormalities were extracted from 
the studies. Prevalence data was presented in three subgroups: non-athletes 
without low back pain, participants with low back pain, and athletes. Prevalence 
data of the most reported abnormalities were pooled using random-effects 
proportion meta-analysis. The study protocol was prospectively registered in 
PROSPERO (CRD42017080543).
RESULTS: The search resulted in 16,783 articles, of which 31 articles (2,373 
participants) were included in this systematic review. Two third of the studies 
had a low risk of bias. The pooled prevalence in non-athletes without LBP, 
participants with LBP, and athletes without LBP was respectively 22%, 44% and 
22% for disc degeneration, 1%, 38% and 13% for herniated discs, 5%, 22% and 11% 
for endplate changes, and 0%, 30% and 6% for pars fractures.
CONCLUSIONS: Disc degeneration, herniated discs, endplate changes, and 
spondylolysis are the most reported spinal abnormalities on MRI in children in 
literature. Spinal abnormalities seen in adults are already prevalent in 
children with LBP, with the highest prevalence for disc degeneration and 
herniated discs.

BACKGROUND: A recent study showed that chiropractic patients had fewer days with 
bothersome (activity-limiting) low back pain (LBP) when receiving care at 
regular pre-planned intervals regardless of symptoms ('maintenance care', MC) 
compared to receiving treatment only with a new episode of LBP. Benefit varied 
across psychological subgroups. The aims of this study were to investigate 1) 
pain trajectories around treatments, 2) recurrence of new episodes of LBP, and 
3) length of consecutive pain-free periods and total number of pain-free weeks, 
for all study participants as well as for each psychological subgroup.
METHODS: A secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of 
patients (n = 319) seeking chiropractic care for recurrent or persistent LBP 
used 52 weekly estimates of days with bothersome (activity-limiting) LBP. First, 
a generalized estimating equations analysis was used to compare the pain 
trajectory before and after the initial treatment in every new treatment period. 
Thereafter, a time-to-event analysis (using Cox regression) estimated time 
to/risk of a new LBP episode. The analyses were performed on i) all study 
participants and ii) separately for each psychological sub-group (named adaptive 
copers, interpersonally distressed and dysfunctional) classified by the West 
Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory.
RESULTS: Patients receiving MC had flat pain trajectories around each new 
treatment period and reported fewer days with pain compared to patients 
receiving the control intervention. The entire effect was attributed to the 
dysfunctional subgroup who reported fewer days with activity limiting pain 
within each new LBP episode as well as longer total pain-free periods between 
episodes with a difference of 9.8 weeks (CI 95% 3.3, 16.3) compared to the 
control group. There were no differences in the time to/risk of a new episode of 
LBP in either of the subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Data support the use of MC in a stratified care model targeting 
dysfunctional patients for MC. For a carefully selected group of patients with 
recurrent and persistent LBP the clinical course becomes more stable and the 
number of pain-free weeks between episodes increases when receiving MC. 
Understanding how subgroups of patients are likely to be affected by MC may help 
align patients' and clinicians' expectations based on realistic outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established treatment for 
chronic neuropathic, neuropathic-like and ischaemic pain. However, the 
heterogeneity of patients in daily clinical practice makes it often challenging 
to determine which patients are eligible for this treatment, resulting in 
undesirable practice variations. This study aimed to establish patient-specific 
recommendations for referral and selection of SCS in chronic pain.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary European panel used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness 
Method (RUAM) to assess the appropriateness of (referral for) SCS for 386 
clinical scenarios in four pain areas: chronic low back pain and/or leg pain, 
complex regional pain syndrome, neuropathic pain syndromes and ischaemic pain 
syndromes. In addition, the panel identified a set of psychosocial factors that 
are relevant to the decision for SCS treatment.
RESULTS: Appropriateness of SCS was strongly determined by the neuropathic or 
neuropathic-like pain component, location and spread of pain, anatomic 
abnormalities and previous response to therapies targeting pain processing (e.g. 
nerve block). Psychosocial factors considered relevant for SCS selection were as 
follows: lack of engagement, dysfunctional coping, unrealistic expectations, 
inadequate daily activity level, problematic social support, secondary gain, 
psychological distress and unwillingness to reduce high-dose opioids. An 
educational e-health tool was developed that combines clinical and psychosocial 
factors into an advice on referral/selection for SCS.
CONCLUSIONS: The RUAM was useful to establish a consensus on patient-specific 
criteria for referral/selection for SCS in chronic pain. The e-health tool may 
help physicians learn to apply an integrated approach of clinical and 
psychosocial factors.
SIGNIFICANCE: Determining the eligibility of SCS in patients with chronic pain 
requires careful consideration of a variety of clinical and psychosocial 
factors. Using a systematic approach to combine evidence from clinical studies 
and expert opinion, a multidisciplinary European expert panel developed detailed 
recommendations to support appropriate referral and selection for SCS in chronic 
pain. These recommendations are available as an educational e-health tool 
(https://www.scstool.org/).

OBJECTIVE: The management of stone disease in renal abnormalities is a challenge 
for urologist due to its rarity. The aim of the current manuscript is to report 
our experience in Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS) in 4 complex-abdnormal 
cases using the flexible videoureterorrenoscopy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data was prospectively collected and retrospectively 
analyzed regarding our first 100 RIRS for stone disease with flexible 
videoureterorrenoscope (FLEX-X 8.4 Fr- STORZ®) between 2017and 2018. Four 
patients presented with renal anomalies and stone disease; one horseshoe kidney, 
polycystickidney, a renal ectopia fused and a caliceal diverticulum. We analyzed 
demographic variables (age andgender), stone size, previous treatment received, 
clinical presentation, stone free rate and complication rate using Dindo-Clavien 
classification.
RESULTS: 4 (4%) cases of renal stone disease associated to renal anomalies were 
identified. All procedures were ambulatory. The mean age was 56 years (43 to 65) 
being 3 male and 1 female. The average stone size was 16.25 mm (6 to 23). All 
cases represented recurrent stone disease, initially treated with a primary 
treatment such as extracorporeal shock wave or percutaneous lithotripsy. The 
mean surgical time was 57 minutes (43 to 79) and the stone free rate 100%. As 
complications, one patient presented low back pain at 48 hour safter surgery, 
which did not yield with oral analgesics requiring intravenous treatment, 
although without admission (Clavien II).
CONCLUSION: Retrograde intrarenal surgery for the management of renal stone in 
kidney anomalies is safe, feasible and effective. However; more cases and 
comparative studies with percutaneous and extracorporeal lithotripsy are needed 
to optimize treatment decision making.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: El manejo de la litiasis en anomalías renales es un desafío 
para el urólogo debido a su infrecuencia; motivo por el cual, el objetivo es 
presentar nuestra experiencia en Cirugía Retrógrada Intrarrenal (RIRS) en 4 
casos con el uso del videoureterorrenoscopio flexible.MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: 
Analizamos retrospectivamente la base de datos de las primeras 100 RIRS por 
litiasis desde la incorporación del videoureterorrenoscopio flexible (FLEX-X 8.4 
Fr-STORZ®). Un total de 4 (4%) pacientes presentaban una anomalía renal 
asociada;un riñón en herradura, un riñón poliquístico, una ectopía renal cruzada 
fusionada y un divertículo calicial. Las variables analizadas fueron; 
demográficas (edad y género); tamaño de la litiasis, tratamientos previos, 
presentación clínica, tasa libre de litiasis y tasa de complicaciones 
perioperatorias según la clasificación Dindo-Clavien.
RESULTADOS: Entre febrero 2017- marzo del 2018, 4 (4%) pacientes presentaban 
litiasis asociada a alguna malformación renal. Todos los procedimientos fueron 
ambulatorios y las litiasis accesibles a la deflexión del endoscopio a pesar de 
la malformación. La edad promedio fue de 56 años (43 a 65 años) siendo 3 hombres 
y 1 mujeres. El tamaño medio de la litiasis fue de 16,25 milímetros (6 a 23 mm). 
Todos los pacientes habían sido tratados previamente con Litotricia Extracopórea 
por Ondas de Choque (LEOC) y, el paciente con ectopía renal cruzada, mediante un 
abordaje percutáneo sin éxito. El tiempo promedio de cirugía fue de 57 minutos 
(43 a 79 minutos) siendo la tasa libre de litiasis del 100%. Como 
complicaciones, un paciente presentó dolor lumbar a las 48 horas de la cirugía 
que no cedió con analgésicos vía oral requiriendo tratamiento endovenoso aunque 
sin hospitalización (Clavien II).CONCLUSIÓN: La cirugía retrógrada intrarrenal 
es factible, segura y efectiva para el manejo de la litiasis en anomalías 
renales. No obstante, se necesitan mayor número de casos y estudios comparativos 
con la litotricia percutánea y extracorpórea como para optarlo como tratamiento 
de primera línea y no como alternativa a los anteriores.

Low back pain is one of most common musculoskeletal disorders around the world. 
One major problem clinicians face is the lack of objective assessment 
modalities. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are commonly 
utilized but are unable to clearly distinguish patients with low back pain from 
healthy patients with respect to abnormalities. The reason may be the 
anisotropic nature of muscles, which is altered in function, and the scans 
provide only structural assessment. In view of this, ultrasound may be helpful 
in understanding the disease as it is performed in real-time and comprises 
different modes that measure thickness, blood flow and stiffness. By the use of 
ultrasound, patients with low back pain have been found to differ from healthy 
patients with respect to the thickness and stiffness of the transversus 
abdominis, thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus. The study results are currently 
still not conclusive, and further study is necessary to validate. Future work 
should focus on quantitative assessment of these tissues to provide textural, 
structural, hemodynamic and mechanical studies of low back pain. This review 
highlights the current understanding of how medical ultrasound has been used for 
diagnosis and study of low back pain and discusses potential new applications.

We previously identified alpha frequency slowing and beta attenuation in the 
dynamic pain connectome related to pain severity and interference in patients 
with multiple sclerosis-related neuropathic pain (NP). Here, we determined 
whether these abnormalities, are markers of aberrant temporal dynamics in 
non-neuropathic inflammatory pain (non-NP) or when NP is also suspected. We 
measured resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) spectral density in 45 
people (17 females, 28 males) with chronic back pain due to ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) and 38 age/sex matched healthy controls. We used painDETECT 
scores to divide the chronic pain group into those with only non-NP (NNP) and 
those who likely also had a component of NP in addition to their inflammatory 
pain. We also assessed pain severity, pain interference, and disease activity 
with the Brief Pain Inventory and Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). We 
examined spectral power in the dynamic pain connectome, including nodes of the 
ascending nociceptive pathway (ANP), default mode (DMN), and salience networks 
(SN). Compared to the healthy controls, the AS patients exhibited increased 
theta power in the DMN and decreased low-gamma power in the DMN and ANP, but did 
not exhibit beta-band attenuation or peak-alpha slowing. The NNP patients were 
not different from HCs. Compared to both healthy controls and NNP, NP patients 
had increased alpha power in the ANP. Increased alpha power within the ANP was 
associated with reduced BASDAI in the NNP group, and increased pain in the 
mixed-NP group within the DMN, SN, and ANP. Thus, high theta and low gamma 
activity may be markers of chronic pain but high alpha-band activity may relate 
to particular features of neuropathic chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common presentation among pregnant women.
CASE: This case report highlights two women who developed excessive low back 
radicular nerve symptoms during pregnancy as the initial presentation of 
proximal venous thromboembolism.
CONCLUSION: The use of Doppler ultrasound imaging or magnetic resonance imaging 
is suggested for women presenting with severe clinical symptoms of radicular low 
back or leg pain in pregnancy to rule out thromboembolism and guide patient 
management.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer is associated with poor prognosis. Diagnosis is 
often delayed, resulting in presentation with advanced disease. We developed a 
clinical score to predict the risk of a malignant diagnosis in symptomatic 
patients prior to any diagnostic tests.
METHODS: We analyzed data from patients referred to a regional esophageal 
diagnostic assessment program between May 2013 and August 2016. Logistic 
regression was performed to identify predictors of malignancy based on patient 
characteristics and symptoms. Predicted probabilities were used to develop a 
score from 0 to 10 which was weighted according to beta coefficients for 
predictors in the model. Score accuracy was evaluated using a receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve and internally validated using bootstrapping 
techniques. Patients were classified into low (0-2 points), medium (3-6 points), 
and high (7-10 points) risk groups based on their scores. Pathologic tissue 
diagnosis was used to assess the effectiveness of the developed score in 
predicting the risk of malignancy in each group.
RESULTS: Of 530 patients, 363 (68%) were diagnosed with malignancy. Factors 
predictive of malignancy included male sex, family history of cancer and 
esophageal cancer, fatigue, chest/throat/back pain, melena and weight loss. 
These factors were allocated 1-2 points each for a total of 10 points. Low-risk 
patients had 70% lower chance of malignancy (RR =0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.38), 
medium-risk had 50% higher chance of malignancy (RR =1.5, 95% CI: 1.26-1.77), 
and high-risk patients were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with malignancy 
(RR =8.2, 95% CI: 2.60-25.86). The area under the ROC curve for malignancy was 
0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: A simple score using patient characteristics and symptoms reliably 
distinguished malignant from benign diagnoses in a population of patients with 
upper gastrointestinal symptoms. This score might be useful in expediting 
investigations, referrals and eventual diagnosis of malignancy.

School, Boston, MA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Lumbar fusion with implantation of interbody cage is a common 
procedure for treatment of lumbar degenerative disease. This study aims to 
compare the fusion and subsidence rates of titanium (Ti) versus 
polyetheretherketone (PEEK) interbody cages after posterior lumbar interbody 
fusion and investigate the effect of clinical and radiological outcomes 
following fusion on patient-reported outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic search strategy of 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, 
Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane) was conducted using different MeSH 
(medical subject headings) terms until January 2020. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using fixed and random-effect 
models based upon the heterogeneity (I2) to estimate the association between 
interbody cages and the measured outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 1,094 patients from 11 studies were reviewed. The final 
analysis included 421 patients (38.5%) who had lumbar surgery using a Ti and/or 
a Ti-coated interbody cage and 673 patient (61.5%) who had lumbar surgery using 
a PEEK cage. Overall, PEEK interbody devices were associated with a 
significantly lower fusion rate compared with Ti interbody devices (OR, 0.62; 
95% CI, 0.41-0.93; p = 0.02). There was no difference in subsidence rates 
between Ti and PEEK groups (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.54-1.52; p = 0.71). Also, there 
were no statistically significant differences in visual analogue scale (VAS)-low 
back pain (p = 0.14) and Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (p = 0.86) 
between the 2 groups. However, the PEEK group had lower odds of leg pain after 
surgery compared to the Ti group (OR [VAS-leg], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.28-0.94; p = 
0.003).
CONCLUSION: Ti and Ti-coated PEEK cages used for posterior lumbar interbody 
fusion are associated with similar rates of subsidence, but a higher rate of 
fusion compared to PEEK interbody cages. Randomized controlled trials are needed 
to better assess the effect of cage materials and potential factors that could 
influence the outcomes of interbody lumbar fusion.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective concurrent cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the relationship between radiographic alignment 
parameters and functional CoE measurements at 1 week before and at 3 months 
after realignment surgery in ADS patients. Adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS) 
represents a significant healthcare burden with exceedingly high and increasing 
prevalence, particularly among the elderly. Radiographic alignment measures and 
patient-reported outcomes currently serve as the standard means to assess spinal 
alignment, deformity, and stability. Neurological examinations have served as 
qualitative measures for indicating muscle strength, motor deficits, and gait 
abnormalities. Three-dimensional motion analysis is increasingly being used to 
identify and measure gait and balance instability. Recently, techniques have 
been established to quantify balance characteristics described by Dubousset as 
the "cone of economy" (CoE). The relationship between radiographic alignment 
parameters and CoE balance measures of ADS patients before and after realignment 
surgery is currently unknown.
PATIENT SAMPLE: 29 ADS patients treated with realignment surgery.
METHODS: Patients were evaluated at 1 week before realignment surgery and at 
their 3-month follow-up examination. During each evaluation, patients completed 
self-reported outcomes (visual analog scales for pain, Oswestry Disability 
Index, SRS22r) and a functional balance test. Mean changes in dependent measures 
from before to after surgery were compared using paired t tests. Pearson 
correlations were used to test for significant correlations between changes in 
radiographic and CoE measures.
RESULTS: Significant improvements were found for all patient-reported outcomes, 
in several radiographic measures, and in CoE measures. Improvements of scoliosis 
Cobb angle, coronal pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis, and thoracic kyphosis showed 
significant correlations with CoE sway and total distance measures at both the 
center of mass and center of the head.
CONCLUSION: Improved radiographic alignment measures significantly correlated 
with improved CoE balance measures among ADS patients treated with realignment 
surgery at their three-month follow-up. These findings indicate that functional 
balance evaluations when used in conjunction with radiographic measurements, may 
provide a more robust and improved patient-specific sensitivity for 
postoperative assessments. CoE balance may represent a new measure of added 
value for surgical intervention of ADS.

The epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumor with pulmonary metastasis: A rare 
case report and literature review.

Xu D(1), Lin X, Qiu X.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital and College of Basic 
Medical Sciences, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.

RATIONALE: Available literature states that the histological subtype of the 
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with pulmonary metastasis is often spindle 
cell type. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the GIST with pulmonary 
metastasis of very uncommon epithelioid subtype.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a 63-year-old male presenting with the symptom of 
bloodstained sputum without obvious inducement. The patient had no chest pain, 
low back pain, fatigue, fever or night sweats symptoms.
DIAGNOSES: Combined chest digital radiography and the history of the patient who 
presented with the colon GIST of the epithelioid subtype two years ago that the 
mass may be a metastasis tumor. Combined with morphological and 
immunohistochemical staining results, a pathological diagnosis of the GIST with 
pulmonary metastasis was considered.
INTERVENTIONS: Right lobectomy and partial upper lobectomy were performed.
OUTCOMES: The patient had not experienced any noticeable symptom and recurrent 
tumors at 6 months follow-up.
LESSONS: We report a rare case of the GIST with pulmonary metastasis of 
epithelioid subtype. This case is of great significance to the pathologist's 
clinical work. For pathologists, if an epithelioid tumor in the lung is found, 
it is necessary to check whether the gastrointestinal tract also has the tumor, 
which may be an epithelioid GIST with pulmonary metastasis.

of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.

OBJECTIVE: Somatosensory abnormalities are linked to clinical pain outcomes in 
individuals with spinal pain. However, a range of factors might confound the 
relationship between altered somatosensory function and clinical pain outcomes. 
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the literature to assess the level of 
evidence of associations between psychological, social, physical activity, and 
sleep measures and somatosensory function (assessed via sensory psychophysical 
testing) among individuals with spinal pain.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in 6 electronic 
databases from their inception to June 2018. Two reviewers independently 
assessed the methodological quality using a modified Quality in Prognostic 
Studies (QUIPS) tool and supplemented with recommendations from the Critical 
Appraisal and Data Extraction for the Systematic Review of Prediction Modelling 
Studies (CHARMS) checklist and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 
Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The level of evidence was assessed using the Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system. Data 
were pooled to evaluate the strength of the relationships of interest.
RESULTS: Among the 17 factors identified in the included studies, pain 
catastrophizing, depression, and pain-related fear have significant negative 
(small to fair) associations with pain thresholds. A "very low" to "moderate" 
quality of evidence was found for all the investigated factors. Subgroup 
analysis showed a smaller effect size for pain catastrophizing/fear of movement 
and pain thresholds in individuals with low back pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological factors are associated negatively with pain 
thresholds and they need to be adjusted when establishing predictive 
relationships between somatosensory function and pain outcomes in individuals 
with spinal pain.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effects of lower back pain (LBP) on measures 
of pain, disability, and function in highly symptomatic hip OA patients 
receiving intra-articular steroid injection (IASI) therapy. We also investigated 
the effect of radiographic severity of hip OA for comparison to LBP.
METHODS: 97 consenting subjects with symptomatic hip OA presenting for IASI were 
evaluated at baseline, assessed over an 8-week period, and followed at least 
1 year later for new arthroplasty. At baseline and 8 weeks follow-up patient 
demographics, presence/absence of back pain, physical function tests, a single 
anteroposterior pelvis x-ray, and subjective scores of pain, stiffness and 
function (VAS and WOMAC) were collected. We also followed which subjects 
proceeded to obtain total hip arthroplasty in the examined hip.
RESULTS: Cohorts with LBP reported significantly worse scores for all of VAS 
pain and WOMAC questionnaires but showed no difference in ROM and were not more 
likely to proceed to arthroplasty. Cohorts with severe radiographic OA had 
significantly worsened scores for stiffness (χ2 = 6.74, p = 0.009), decreased 
ROM (p < 0.01), and were more likely to proceed to arthroplasty (χ2 = 9.79, 
p = 0.044).
DISCUSSION: Back pain has a substantial effect on clinical parameters relevant 
to assessment of severity of hip OA, especially self-reported pain and function. 
This finding highlights LBP as a significant confounding factor in hip OA 
patient assessments and will inform future studies to determine the most 
effective treatment strategies for hip OA patients.

OBJECTIVE: To dig the knowledge structure of lumbago's symptoms and acupoints in 
book Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing (A-B Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion) and Zhenjiu 
Dacheng (Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion) in order to provide a 
possible scientific method for exploring their combination regularities in 
ancient Chinese medical books about acupuncture-moxibustion, and to investigate 
the feasibility and scientificity of the "association rule" in trimming the 
related ancient medical books and records.
METHODS: The articles about lumbago's symptoms and employed acupoints were 
screened from classic me-dical book Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing and Zhenjiu Dacheng, 
followed by establishing a database. Then, the bidimensional correlation 
analysis about the lumbago-symptoms and symptoms-acupoints was conducted by 
using Apriori algorithm of Weka3.9.0 platform.
RESULTS: A total of 153 entries about symptoms as spinalgia (31.68%) and cold 
limbs (25.74%) and the employed acupoints as Weizhong (BL40，17.60%), Shenshu 
(BL23, 9.60%) and Kunlun (BL60, 6.40%) are found. The top 3 supplemented 
acupoints are BL40 for concomitant symptoms of spinalgia, BL23 for cold limbs, 
and BL60 for dizzy symptoms. Regarding the paired acupoints for lumbago, the 
most frequently used ones are BL23-BL40 (30.40%)．.
CONCLUSION: In book Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing and Zhenjiu Dacheng, lumbago has chief 
symptoms of spinalgia and cold limbs that are mainly disorders of the Bladder 
Meridian of Foot Taiyang and Governor Vessel, and the acupoints of these two 
meridians are frequently selected in combination with some specific acupoints.

Back pain is one of the most common causes for patients to seek medical care in 
both primary care and emergency setting. An estimated 200 billion dollars are 
spent annually on the management of back pain . It is the most common reason for 
workman's compensation and lost work hours and productivity. There is a broad 
range of potential etiologies for both adult and pediatric populations. The 
etiologies differ depending on the patient population, but most commonly, it is 
mechanical or non-specific. Not all back pain is lumbago or paraspinal muscle 
hypertonicity. Heuristics are useful, but they are also problematic. If 90 
percent of back pain is mechanical, and somewhere between 12 to 33 percent of 
people experience back pain at any one time, then it is likely to be the primary 
focus of medical treatment. The mechanical back is both prevalent and with a 
large incidence. Alternatively, only .00001 percent  (1 in 100,000 cases) of 
back pain cases are either a true red flag such as cauda equina syndrome. By 
only focusing on the most common and most dangerous etiologies of back pain, 
providers are missing a significant portion of cases. Some sources say up the 30 
percent of mechanical back pain is SI joint in origin, yet it is often an 
afterthought in a differential diagnosis. Cases of ankylosing spondylitis are 
missed when providers assume back a patient's back pain is mechanical .  
Inflammatory disorders, malignancy, pregnancy, trauma, osteoporosis, nerve root 
compression, radiculopathy, plexopathy, degenerative disc disease, disc 
herniation, spinal stenosis, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, facet joint injury, 
and infection are all part of the differential. Distinguishing the signs and 
symptoms of nociceptive pain (mechanical) from neuropathic pain (radiculopathy) 
is an essential first step in the diagnosis of back pain. Special tests such as 
the straight leg raise or Patrick's test can be used to help differentiate the 
origin of the patient's back pain. Back pain causes significant rates of 
disability and can be a problem that persists from childhood into adulthood. 
Back pain is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Chronic back 
pain is also the most common cause of chronic pain.  he two most important 
aspects in the management of back pain are the identification of red flags that 
could be alarming for diagnoses such as malignancy or cauda equina syndrome, and 
stopping the development of chronic pain in the acute setting. It is essential 
to be able to evaluate patients of all ages and understand the unique 
differences in the presentation in these different populations. Knowing the 
typical red flags of back pain such as weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, 
or pain that awakens patient's from sleep in both children and adults can guide 
the provider to appropriate evaluation and treatment. Most cases of back pain 
resolve with some patience and time. Conservative management often includes over 
the counter pain medications such as acetaminophen or NSAID's. Muscle relaxers, 
gabapentin, topical analgesics, and opioids all play a role in the management of 
back pain, on a case by case basis. Most cases of back pain are mechanical in 
origin and respond to activity modification, rest, ice, and heat. Physical 
therapy and core strengthening exercises also play a role. Different therapy 
modalities have been used to treat back pain, but the most effective is the 
McKenzie method. Unfortunately, not all back pain resolves with a few sessions 
of physical therapy.  If back pain has persisted longer than six weeks duration 
after an acute injury, x-ray imaging may be warranted. Also, MRI of 
the thoracolumbar spine may be necessary to help identify possible disc 
herniation or spinal stenosis.  Furthermore, corticosteroid injections, 
radiofrequency ablative therapy, spinal cord stimulators, kyphoplasty, TENS 
units, and surgeries such as laminectomy, spinal fusion, or discectomy are 
possible treatment options as well for refractory cases. Comorbid conditions 
such as major depressive disorder or opioid use disorder must be addressed and 
treated to their fullest extent to help minimize the long term effects of back 
pain. Seperately, obesity plays a critical role in the development of bak pain 
Integrative treatment modalities such as acupuncture, ti chi, and yoga have also 
been shown to have a moderate effect on the improvement of back pain. Limited 
studies have been done regarding the use of cannabinoids in back pain, but it 
may be promising treatment modality in the future. Back pain is and likely will 
continue to be the focus of many providers because of the profound effect it has 
on patient's day today. Function becomes impaired, activities of daily living is 
changed to accommodate back pain, and quality of life suffers. Unlike injuries 
to almost everywhere else in the body, back pain (and axial skeletal injuries) 
affects almost every aspect of life. Sleeping is disrupted, it is difficult to 
bend, reach or turn, it is hard to drive or go to work, lifting and exercise 
became strenuous, anxiety-provoking activity, walking to the bathroom becomes a 
chore. When you experience back pain, it is hard to think of anything else. It 
is with you everywhere you go, and there is nothing you want more than to have 
it go away. The articles address how we diagnosis back pain through a careful 
history and physical exam, evaluate back pain with various diagnostic tests and 
treat back pain with pharmacological, interventional, surgical, 
non-pharmacological, and alternative treatment modalities.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the fractional 
anisotropy (FA) values of compressed nerves derived in diffusion tensor imaging 
(DTI) and the corresponding clinical symptoms for quantitative and clinical 
evaluation in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy.
METHODS: Thirty-six patients and ten volunteers participated in the study and 
measured with DTI. The resultant FA values for L5-S1 lumbar nerve roots were 
calculated at three sub-regions. Additionally, the DTI relevant tractography was 
also performed on L4-S1 nerve roots. Clinical symptoms were performed by 
Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring for each patient and volunteer.
RESULTS: The FA values of the nerves at the symptomatic side were significantly 
lower than those at the asymptomatic side (p < 0.001). Diffusion tensor 
tractography distinctly showed abnormalities in the symptomatic nerve tracts. 
There was a significant correlation between JOA scores and the FA values of the 
compressed nerves at middle and distal sub-regions (p < 0.005).
CONCLUSION: The clinical symptoms associated robustly with the DTI derived FA 
values of the compressed nerves in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy. 
Therefore, the FA values can be a potential clinical tool to evaluate the nerve 
roots in lumbosacral radiculopathy quantitatively.

This case report concerns a 34-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS), fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), osteoarthritis (OA), 
lumbar disc herniation and the like in different hospitals during the past 18 
months. She had progressive osteoarthrosis, significant muscle weakness, gait 
abnormalities in weightbearing areas, however without typical inflammatory low 
back pain, while the treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) was invalid, with normal inflammation index, negative results for 
rheumatic factor (RF) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, and normal 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). She had 
hyphosphatemia, normal serum calcium, 1,25-(OH)2-D3 reduction, elevated alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) and normal parathyroid hormone (PTH), however with elevated 
urinary phosphorus. Finally, the medial thigh nodule was found in the 
subcutaneous of her inner leg by careful examination and imaging scans including 
B-ultrasound and PET/CT. The final pathology confirmed that the nodule was 
phosphate urinary mesenchymal tumors. After the tumor was removed, the patient 
was treated with anti-osteoporosis and phosphorus supplementation. The symptoms 
of bone pain and muscle weakness were alleviated, and hypophosphatemia was 
corrected. It was confirmed that the patient had low-phosphorus osteomalacia due 
to tumor. Tumor-induced hypophosphatemia osteomalacia (TIO) was a rare 
paraneoplastic syndrome which was caused by excessive phosphorus excretion 
induced by the tumor, and was thus categorized as an acquired hypophosphatemic 
osteomalacia. TIO had an occult onset and was associated with a high rate of 
misdiagnosis, although TIO has some typical clinical features. Early diagnosis, 
correctly positioning of the tumor, and surgical resection can achieve good 
outcomes.

Due to concerns about cumulative radiation exposure in the pediatric population, 
it is not standard practice to perform spine radiographs in most conditions that 
predispose to vertebral fracture (VF). In this study we examined the accuracy of 
two clinical predictors, back pain and lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS 
BMD), to derive four case-finding paradigms for detection of prevalent VF (PVF). 
Subjects were 400 children at risk for PVF (leukemia 186, rheumatic disorders 
135, nephrotic syndrome 79). Back pain was assessed by patient report, LS BMD 
was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and PVF were quantified on 
spine radiographs using the modified Genant semiquantitative method. Forty-four 
patients (11.0%) had PVF. Logistic regression analysis between LS BMD and PVF 
produced an odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 2.5) 
per reduction in Z-score unit, an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.79), and an optimal BMD Z-score 
cutoff of -1.6. Case identification using either low BMD alone (Z-score < -1.6) 
or back pain alone gave similar results for sensitivity (55%, 52%, 
respectively), specificity (78%, 81%, respectively), positive predictive value 
(PPV; 24%, 25%, respectively), and negative predictive value (NPV; 93%, 93%, 
respectively). The paradigm using low BMD plus back pain produced lower 
sensitivity (32%), higher specificity (96%), higher PPV (47%), and similar NPV 
(92%). The approach using low BMD or back pain had the highest sensitivity 
(75%), lowest specificity (64%), lowest PPV (20%), and highest NPV (95%). All 
paradigms had increased sensitivities for higher fracture grades. Our results 
show that BMD and back pain history can be used to identify children with the 
highest risk of PVF so that radiography can be used judiciously. The specific 
paradigm to be applied will depend on the expected PVF rate and the clinical 
approach to the use of radiography. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral

Osteitis condensans Ilii (OCI) is a self-limiting condition marked by sclerosis 
of the iliac bone, found either incidentally on imaging in asymptomatic patients 
or those presenting with lower back pain. Imaging and clinical findings are 
localized to the sacroiliac joint(s) and thus, must be differentiated from other 
conditions that may present in a similar fashion (spondyloarthritis, 
degenerative arthritis, septic arthritis). Although some of the presenting 
features at times may overlap, OCI is distinct in that it spares the joint 
space, is not progressive, and most commonly presents in the absence of lab 
value abnormalities.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of spinal 
deformities in ambulant adults with cerebral palsy (CP) and spastic diplegia, 
more than 15 years after orthopaedic interval surgery approach (ISA) treatment, 
and its relationship to contextual factors, level of pain and physical status.
METHODS: Spinal X-rays, pain (Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and 
location/frequency) questionnaires and physical examination assessing lower 
extremity muscle strength (Medical Research Council scale), motor control 
(selectivity scale) and muscle tone (Ashworth score) were conducted in 30 adults 
with spastic diplegic CP.
RESULTS: Mild scoliosis (curve 12-22°) was determined in eight (28%) 
participants. Hyperkyphosis (> 50°) was reported in two (7%) and lumbar 
hyperlordosis (> 60°) in five (17%) participants. Pain was most commonly 
reported at cervical (n = 19, 63%) and lumbosacral (n = 18, 60%) area, resulting 
in 'moderate disability' for six (20%) and 'severe disability' for one (3%) 
participant. Most apparent physical abnormalities determined were hip abduction 
weakness and increased rectus femoris muscle tone. Regarding correlations, no 
relations were found for scoliosis curvature, but kyphosis curvature was related 
to females, ODI scores (lifting and sitting) and increased muscle tone of ankle 
plantar flexor muscles, lordosis curvature to passive hip extension mobility, 
and hip flexors and ankle plantar flexors muscle tone.
CONCLUSION: Adults with spastic diplegic CP who received their first orthopaedic 
intervention more than 15 years ago (based on ISA) showed similar incidence of 
spinal deformities as reported in the younger CP population, suggesting 
stability of spinal curvature into adulthood. These slides can be retrieved 
under Electronic Supplementary Material.

BACKGROUND: Powered exoskeletons provide a way to stand and walk for people with 
severe spinal cord injury. Here, we used the ReWalk exoskeleton to determine the 
training dosage required for walking proficiency, the sensory and motor changes 
in the nervous system with training, and the functionality of the device in a 
home-like environment.
METHODS: Participants with chronic (> 1 yr) motor complete or incomplete spinal 
cord injury, who were primarily wheelchair users, were trained to walk in the 
ReWalk for 12 weeks. Measures were taken before, during, immediately after, and 
2-3 months after training. Measures included walking progression, sitting 
balance, skin sensation, spasticity, and strength of the corticospinal tracts.
RESULTS: Twelve participants were enrolled with 10 completing training. Training 
progression and walking ability: The progression in training indicated about 45 
sessions to reach 80% of final performance in training. By the end of training, 
participants walked at speeds of 0.28-0.60 m/s, and distances of 0.74-1.97 km in 
1 h. The effort of walking was about 3.3 times that for manual wheelchair 
propulsion. One non-walker with an incomplete injury became a walker without the 
ReWalk after training. Sensory and motor measures: Sitting balance was improved 
in some, as seen from the limits of stability and sway speed. Neuropathic pain 
showed no long term changes. Change in spasticity was mixed with suggestion of 
differences between those with high versus low spasticity prior to training. The 
strength of motor pathways from the brain to back extensor muscles remained 
unchanged. Adverse events: Minor adverse events were encountered by the 
participants and trainer (skin abrasions, non-injurious falls). Field testing: 
The majority of participants could walk on uneven surfaces outdoors. Some 
limitations were encountered in home-like environments.
CONCLUSION: For individuals with severe SCI, walking proficiency in the ReWalk 
requires about 45 sessions of training. The training was accompanied by 
functional improvements in some, especially in people with incomplete injuries.

BACKGROUND: Oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) is a surgical technique for 
lumbar interbody fusion that allows surgeons to use a large cage while 
preserving the spine muscles. The surgical corridor of OLIF is close to the 
ureter in the retroperitoneal space and therefore entails a potential for injury 
to this organ. Although there are some published cases of ureteral injury that 
were identified during OLIF, to our knowledge, there have been no reports about 
delayed ureteral strictures and kidney atrophy after OLIF. We report a case of 
ureter stricture and ipsilateral kidney atrophy that was incidentally identified 
a few months postoperatively without signs of ureter injury during the 
operation.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old woman presented with low back and right leg 
pain. On lumbar magnetic resonance imaging, a Meyerding grade 1 
spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5 with L4 nerve root encroachment was confirmed. The 
patient underwent L4/L5 OLIF and was discharged on the 10th day after surgery 
with improved symptoms. Three months later, an abdominopelvic computed 
tomography performed for an unrelated condition showed left kidney atrophy. A 
retrograde ureteropyelogram confirmed a stricture near the operation site. A 
ureter stent was successfully inserted to overcome the stricture, but renal 
atrophy was not reversed.
CONCLUSIONS: Ureter injury may be observed with several months' delay after OLIF 
in patients without symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, even if no direct 
injury was noted during the procedure.

Chronic low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common diseases in the world and 
one of the leading causes of years of life lost due to disability. Despite being 
a major public health concern, studies on access to and use of different types 
of treatment are scarce. The aim of this article is to describe the most common 
treatments for chronic LBP in Brazil, examine the factors associated with the 
use of these treatments, and discuss possible inequalities in the use of 
physical therapy/exercise and medications. A descriptive analysis was performed 
using data from the 2013 National Health Survey. Multiple logistic regression 
was conducted to determine the association between treatment use and 
demographic, socioeconomic, health status, access to health services, and 
geographical characteristics. People with higher education were 2.39 times more 
likely to do physiotherapy. However, no association was found between education 
level and medication use. People in social class A/B were almost twice as likely 
to do physical therapy. However, there was no association between social status 
and medication use. People with a very high or high degree of functional 
limitation were 3.5 times more likely to use medication. However, no association 
was observed between functional limitation and physical therapy use.

Publisher: O Problema Crônico de Coluna (PCC) é uma das doenças mais prevalentes 
no mundo e representa uma das principais causas de anos de vida perdidos por 
incapacidade. Embora de grande relevância para a saúde pública, estudos sobre o 
acesso e a utilização dos tipos de tratamento são escassos. O objetivo deste 
artigo é descrever os principais tratamentos para PCC no Brasil, analisar os 
fatores associados à sua utilização e discutir possíveis desigualdades na 
utilização de fisioterapia /exercícios e a utilização de medicamentos. A partir 
da PNS 2013 foram realizadas análises descritivas sobre prevalência de PCC e 
regressão logística múltipla para analisar a associação segundo as 
características demográficas, socioeconômicas, a situação da saúde, a limitação 
causada pelo PCC, acesso a serviços de saúde e regionais. Ter ensino superior 
aumenta 2,39 vezes as chances de realizar fisioterapia, no entanto, a 
escolaridade não se mostrou associada à utilização de medicamentos. Indivíduos 
de estratos superiores apresentam quase 2 vezes mais chances de realizar 
fisioterapia, o que não foi observado para medicamentos. Sobre as condições de 
saúde, o aumento do grau da limitação por PCC eleva a chance de uso de 
medicamentos em até 3,5 vezes, mas não varia quando associado à realização de 
fisioterapia.

INTRODUCTION: Inferior vena cava agenesis is a rare congenital anomaly, 
generally associated with thrombophilic conditions, and a predisposing factor 
for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), rarely complicated by pulmonary embolism, in a 
young population with atypical clinical features and frequent absence of risk 
factors.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 30-year-old woman who developed a right 
iliac DVT, initially presenting as a low back pain and complicated by a 
pulmonary embolism, 8 months after a sleeve gastrectomy. Chest CT angiography 
revealed abnormalities that led to the diagnosis of inferior vena cava agenesis. 
Thrombophilic screening showed a heterozygous prothrombin gene mutation G20210A 
and hyperhomocysteinemia. The patient was treated with rivaroxaban with good 
results after 2 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In young patients without risk factors developing a deep venous 
thrombosis, an inferior vena cava anomaly should be considered. Although no 
therapeutic consensus has been currently established, inferior vena cava 
agenesis seems to be associated with a high prevalence of thrombophilic 
disorders. Screening could be useful, particularly in patients with a thrombotic 
family history.

BACKGROUND: Chiropractic maintenance care is effective as secondary/tertiary 
prevention of non-specific low back pain (LBP), but the potential effect 
moderation by psychological characteristics is unknown. The objective was to 
investigate whether patients in specific psychological sub-groups had different 
responses to MC with regard to the total number of days with bothersome pain and 
the number of treatments.
METHOD: Data from a two-arm randomized pragmatic multicenter trial with a 
12-month follow up, designed to investigate the effectiveness of maintenance 
care, was used. Consecutive patients, 18-65 years of age, with recurrent and 
persistent LBP seeking chiropractic care with a good effect of the initial 
treatment were included. Eligible subjects were randomized to either maintenance 
care (prescheduled care) or to the control intervention, symptom-guided care. 
The primary outcome of the trial was the total number of days with bothersome 
LBP collected weekly for 12 months using an automated SMS system. Data used to 
classify patients according to psychological subgroups defined by the West 
Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (adaptive copers, interpersonally 
distressed and dysfunctional) were collected at the screening visit.
RESULTS: A total of 252 subjects were analyzed using a generalized estimating 
equations linear regression framework. Patients in the dysfunctional subgroup 
who received maintenance care reported fewer days with pain (-30.0; 95% CI: 
-36.6, -23.4) and equal number of treatments compared to the control 
intervention. In the adaptive coper subgroup, patients who received maintenance 
care reported more days with pain (10.7; 95% CI: 4.0, 17.5) and more treatments 
(3.9; 95% CI: 3.5, 4.2). Patients in the interpersonally distressed subgroup 
reported equal number of days with pain (-0.3; 95% CI: -8.7, 8.1) and more 
treatments (1.5; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.1) on maintenance care.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and behavioral characteristics modify the effect of

PURPOSE: Identify impact of frequency and timing of interim Patient-Reported 
Outcome Measures (PROMs) assessments during episodes of care for rehabilitation 
services in outpatient clinical settings on functional status (FS) outcomes at 
discharge for patients with low back pain.
METHODS: FS outcomes of patients who had no interim PROMs were compared to 
outcomes of six patient groups defined by interim timing (early, mid, late) and 
frequency (1, 2 or more). For each comparison, patients were matched using 
propensity score matching for variables known to be associated with FS outcomes 
and for episode duration (days) and number of visits. FS was assessed using the 
lumbar computerized adaptive test (LCAT) where scores range from 0 to 100 with 
higher scores representing better physical function.
RESULTS: A sample of 140,336 patients was considered for matching (mean age = 58 
[SD = 17] range 18-89; 60% females) with 83,101 patients (59%) having no interim 
PROMs. Patients who had only one interim PROM, administered during early (first 
2 weeks), mid (weeks 3-4), or late (week 5 or later) timing, had 4.6, 2.7, and 
1.0 additional FS score points at discharge compared to those without an interim 
PROM, respectively (p < 0.001). Having two or more interim PROMs was associated 
with an additional 1.2 FS points compared to having only one interim assessment, 
but only if the first interim was administered early.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimal utilization of interim PROM assessment during clinical 
practice to enhance treatment outcomes was related to administering the first 
interim PROM within the first 2 weeks after the initial evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Split cord malformations (SCMs) are among the rare congenital spinal 
anomalies. In 1992, Pang et al. proposed the unified theory of embryogenesis and 
explained the formation of SCM type 1 and 2. This theory has been widely 
accepted in the neurosurgical literature, backed by several studies. However, 
there have been reports in the literature that defy both the classification as 
well as the formation of SCMs, based on the unified theory of embryogenesis. We 
report a case of SCM that does not fit into this classification scheme and try 
to elucidate its embryologic basis, with review of the relevant literature. We 
also attempt to include this variety into the existing classification system of 
SCMs.
CASE DESCRIPTION: An 11-year-old boy presented with low backache after trivial 
trauma. He was neurologically intact. Imaging showed low-lying tethered cord and 
a midline ventral bony spur (D12, L1) with a single dural sac encasing both the 
hemicords. Surgical exploration showed a ventral bony spur with 2 hemicords, 
enclosed in a single dural tube. Excision of the bony spur and detethering of 
the filum terminal were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful and 
the patient was discharged satisfactorily.
CONCLUSIONS: SCMs possibly represent a continuum of changes beginning at the 
gestational age of days 20-30. Terminology such as mixed or intermediate type is 
used to denote SCMs that show features of both type 1 and type II. We prefer 
using type 1.5 SCMs for all such cases, thereby avoiding confusion and 
maintaining uniformity in the nomenclature. However, further experimental 
studies are required to substantiate our understanding of these complex 
embryologic anomalies on the basis of current hypotheses.

BACKGROUND: In rare cases low back pain may be caused by underlying serious 
pathology such as fracture, malignancy, cauda equina syndrome, or spinal 
infection. The lack of evidence regarding either the clinical prevalence or 
population incidence of serious pathologies in the lumbar spine makes it 
difficult for clinicians to adequately assess a patient's risk of serious 
pathology.
PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of serious pathologies in patients with low 
back pain who have been referred for a lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
by a specialist in a private secondary care or public tertiary care setting. The 
incidence of these serious pathologies in the geographic region of South 
Auckland, New Zealand was also investigated.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Consecutive patients referred for lumbar MRI over a 10-month 
period (1st of October 2013-31st of July 2014).
METHOD: Data from all eligible MRI reports was analyzed and any serious 
pathologies were identified and recorded. Prevalence (along with 95% confidence 
intervals) was calculated as a percentage of the study population. Prevalence 
specific to private secondary care and public tertiary care settings was also 
calculated and prevalence rate ratios were determined to allow comparison 
between settings. Incidence in the geographic region of South Auckland, New 
Zealand, was determined using data collected from participants recruited from 
the regional public hospital. Population incidence with respect to age, gender, 
and ethnicity for each target condition was calculated and incidence rate ratios 
were computed to compare groups.
RESULTS: A total of 2,383 participants referred for lumbar MRI scans were 
included in this study. Prevalence was significantly higher in the public 
tertiary care setting than in the private secondary care setting for all 
pathologies investigated in this study. Pathology specific prevalence in 
secondary care vs tertiary care settings was: malignancy, 0.3%, 4.4% (p<.001); 
fracture 2.2%, 6.7% (p<.001); cauda equina compression 0.6%, 2.3% (p=.001); 
infection 0.1%, 3.4% (p<.001). The combined prevalence in secondary care was 
3.2% and in tertiary care 14.8% (p<.001). Pathology specific total incidence 
was: fracture, 13 per 100,000 person-years (p-y); malignancy 8.5 per 100,000 
p-y; cauda equina compression 4.4 per 100,000 p-y; spinal infection 6.6 per 
100,000 p-y.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of serious pathologies was significantly higher in 
tertiary care (public health) than in private secondary care settings. One in 
every 6.5 patients referred for MRI in tertiary care demonstrated structural 
abnormalities associated with serious pathology, which raises the question of 
whether access to MRI should be re-evaluated.

BACKGROUND: Incomplete ossification of the pars interarticularis will result in 
a pars defect, a common cause of low back pain in youth and strongly associated 
with participation in high-impact sports. If left untreated, it can result in 
spondylolisthesis, causing dynamic canal stenosis, low back pain, and 
radiculopathy. The treatment of pars defect was first described by Bucks in 
1970, who used screws in the lamina placed through an upward and outward 
direction. However, because of the multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
narrow margin of error, the Bucks pars repair technique is not commonly 
performed.
METHODS: A 28-year-old woman had with low back pain that she had been 
experiencing since mid-adolescence. Computed tomography revealed a bilateral L5 
pars defect without spondylolisthesis. Her L5 vertebra was reconstructed 
virtually. The screw trajectories, a 3-dimensional (3D) model of the vertebra, 
and a patient-specific drill guide (PSDG) were designed and printed using 
positioning guide software (MySpine MC Guides [Medacta International SA, Castel 
San Petro, Switzerland]). A modified Bucks procedure using cannulated 
compression screws and the PSDG was performed.
RESULTS: Follow-up computed tomography revealed accurate placement of the 
compression screws, mirroring the planned trajectory. The patient was pain free 
at 3 months postoperatively, and early union across the defect was visualized on 
the 5-month radiographic imaging study.
CONCLUSION: Using 3D planning software, complex surgical procedures can be 
planned using the patient's anatomy and computed tomography. With the aid of 
3D-printed PSDGs, screw placement in narrow corridors, such as was shown in our 
case, is safe, efficient, and achievable.

A 40-year-old woman with a history of chronic low back pain underwent a 
fluoroscopically guided intradiscal platelet-rich plasma injection (PRP) at the 
L5-S1 level. She subsequently developed progressive low back pain, night sweats 
and decreased ability to ambulate. Laboratory work-up revealed elevated acute 
phase reactants and imaging revealed L5-S1 intervertebral disc and vertebral 
end-plate abnormalities highly suggestive of spondylodiscitis. Computed 
tomography-guided aspiration and biopsy cultures grew Cutibacterium acnes and 
the patient was subsequently treated with intravenous antibiotics without 
surgical management. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published 
case of lumbar spondylodiscitis following an intradiscal PRP injection, and 
brings to the forefront several clinically relevant issues including the 
antimicrobial effects of PRP, the role of C. acnes in spine infections and the 
ideal treatment protocol for intradiscal biologics in order to minimize 
morbidity and optimize functional outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Spinal stenosis may result in myelopathy, radiculopathy, and 
neurogenic claudication. It is often difficult to differentiate between these 
conditions. A comprehensive history and physical examination and a magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire spine accurately confirm the diagnosis.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we report a patient with low back and progressive 
bilateral lower extremity pain, numbness, and weakness with bowel incontinence, 
urinary retention, and gait abnormalities. A lumbar MRI demonstrated multilevel 
severe spondylosis/stenosis from L3-S1. The patient underwent a decompressive 
lumbar laminectomy from L3-5. However, the patient continued to experience the 
same symptoms postoperatively along with flexor spasms of the left leg, dystonic 
posturing of the left foot, hyperactive bilateral patellar and Achilles deep 
tendon reflexes, and a Babinski sign. An NCV of the legs revealed no lumbar 
radiculopathy. The thoracic MRI, however, demonstrated severe spondylosis at the 
T11-12 level attributed to a large synovial cyst. Following decompression/cyst 
resection, the patient's symptoms partially resolved within 1 postoperative 
month.
CONCLUSION: Spinal surgeons should be alert to the potential for overlapping 
symptoms/signs of thoracic myelopathy and lumbar myeloradiculopathy. If there 
are features of upper and lower motor neuron disease, MR scans of the entire 
spine are necessary before lumbar surgical decompression to identify significant 
cephalad surgical pathology.

Despite the current knowledge about abnormalities in the lumbo-pelvic 
coordination of patients with non-specific low back pain (LBP), it is unclear 
how such abnormalities change with time. Timing and magnitude aspects of 
lumbo-pelvic coordination during a trunk forward bending and backward return 
task along with subjective measures of pain and disability were collected at 
three-time points over a six-month period from 29 patients who had non-chronic 
LBP at the time of enrollment in the study. To enable investigation of 
abnormalities in lumbo-pelvic coordination of patients, we also included 
lumbo-pelvic coordination data of age and gender-matched back healthy 
individuals from an earlier study of our group. Finally, differences in 
lumbo-pelvic coordination between patients with moderate-severe LBP (i.e., those 
whose level of pain was ≥ 4 (out of 10) at all three data collection sessions; 
n = 8) and patients with low-moderate LBP (n = 21) were investigated. There were 
clear distinctions in measures of lumbo-pelvic coordination between patients 
with low-moderate and moderate-severe LBP. Contrary to our expectation, however, 
the abnormalities in magnitude aspects of lumbo-pelvic coordination were larger 
(F > 4.84, P < 0.012) in patients with low-moderate LBP. These abnormalities in 
patients with low-moderate LBP, compared to controls, included larger (>12°) 
pelvic and thoracic rotations as well as smaller (>10°) lumbar flexion. The 
abnormal lumbo-pelvic coordination of patients with non-specific LBP, observed 
at baseline, persisted (F < 1.96, P > 0.156) or worsen (F > 3.48, P < 0.04) over 
the course of study period despite significant improvement in their pain (18% 
decrease; F = 12.10, P < 0.001) and disability (10% decrease; F = 4.39, 
P = 0.017). Distinct but lingering abnormalities in lumbo-pelvic coordination, 
observed in patients with low-moderate and moderate-severe LBP, might have a 
role in persistence and/or relapse of symptoms in patients with non-specific 
LBP. Such inferences, however, should further be studied in future via 
investigation of the relationship between abnormalities in lumbo-pelvic 
coordination and clinical presentation of LBP.

Purpose: A 2014 study found that the Lumbar Spine Instability questionnaire 
predicts response to two different types of exercise therapy. This is the first 
decision tool that has predicted response to exercise for chronic low back pain. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the Lumbar Spine Instability 
questionnaire using Rasch analysis. Methods: Baseline data from patients 
included in a randomized controlled trial with chronic non-specific low back 
pain were included. Rasch Measurement Theory was used to assess the ordering of 
items along a common scale, data-to-model fit, Person Separation Index, 
unidimensionality and Differential Item Functioning. Results: Responses from 172 
patients (102 females) underwent Rasch analysis. All Lumbar Spine Instability 
questionnaire items had fit residuals between ± 2.5 and Chi-Square values were 
non-significant with Bonferroni corrections. The Lumbar Spine Instability 
questionnaire demonstrated a Person Separation Index of 0.64, which is below the 
recommended cut-off of 0.7. Differential Item Functioning by different pain 
levels was identified for one item. Conclusion: The Lumbar Spine Instability 
questionnaire was found to be unidimensional, suggesting that the use of a 
summary score is appropriate. However, the low Person Separation Index value 
suggests that more items may be needed to increase the questionnaire's ability 
to discriminate among individuals with high and low clinical instability.

OBJECTIVES: Flatfoot, or low medial longitudinal arch, contributes to back and 
lower extremity injuries and is caused by weak abductor hallucis (AbdH) muscles. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of short foot exercise 
(SFE) alone or with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on navicular 
height, the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the AbdH muscle, and AbdH muscle 
activity in flexible flatfoot.
METHODS: Thirty-six otherwise healthy people with flexible flatfoot were 
randomly assigned to a group that received SFE with placebo NMES treatment (the 
control group) or a group that received both SFE and NMES treatment (the 
experimental group). Each group received 4 weeks of treatment (SFE alone or SFE 
with NMES). Navicular height, the CSA of the AbdH muscle, and AbdH muscle 
activity were assessed before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in navicular height or the CSA of 
the AbdH muscle between the control and experimental groups, while AbdH muscle 
activity showed a statistically significant difference between the groups 
(SFE=73.9±11.0% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction [MVIC]; SFE with 
NMES=81.4±8.3% of MVIC; p<0.05). Moreover, the CSA of the AbdH muscle showed a 
statistically significant increase after treatment in the SFE with NMES group 
(pre-treatment=218.6±53.2 mm2; post-treatment=256.9±70.5 mm2; p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: SFE with NMES was more effective than SFE alone in increasing AbdH 
muscle activity. Therefore, SFE with NMES should be recommended to correct or 
prevent abnormalities in people with flexible flatfoot by a physiotherapist or 
medical care team.

BACKGROUND: Building on the recent finding that chronic pain patients with 
impaired functioning of the descending nociceptive inhibitory system (DNIS) 
present lower resting heart rate variability (HRV), this study aims to 
investigate the impact of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) on HRV in patients with 
Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). More precisely, we hypothesize that SCS 
influences the DNIS, with increased parasympathetic tone as a consequence, as 
measurable by HRV analysis.
METHODS: Twenty-two patients diagnosed with FBSS and treated with SCS 
participated in this study. HRV was measured with a 2-lead ECG registration tool 
during on and off states of SCS. HRV analysis for time, frequency, 
time-frequency and nonlinear domain parameters was based on a 5-minute recording 
segment.
RESULTS: The mean heart rate and low frequency power were significantly lower 
when SCS was activated. HRV, absolute and normalized high frequency power 
significantly increased during SCS compared to without SCS. The ratio of low 
frequency/high frequency ratios, as parameter for global 
sympathetic-parasympathetic equilibrium, significantly decreased when SCS was 
activated.
CONCLUSIONS: When SCS is switched off, patients with FBSS present relatively 
stronger sympathetic tone and weaker parasympathetic activity. Activation of the 
SCS, possibly via stimulation of the DNIS, restores this disbalance of autonomic 
activity.

University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, PR China.

RATIONALE: The differential diagnosis of conditions manifesting as bone and 
joint pain is complex. Although many individuals with acute leukemia experience 
bone pain, lumbosacral pain as an early feature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) is rare.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report a case of an adult who presented with a 7-month 
history of persistent lumbosacral pain which had become more severe during the 
previous month.
DIAGNOSES: Prior to referral, his full blood count revealed no abnormalities, 
and a computerized tomography scan revealed mild bone hyperplasia of his lumbar 
vertebrae, with disc herniations of L3-S1. His blood biochemistry and urinary 
test results had been normal. After referral to our clinic, tests of the 
morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology of his bone marrow 
led to a diagnosis of MLL-AF4 fusion positive B-cell ALL.
INTERVENTIONS: Prior to his referral, he had been treated with painkillers by 
local doctors. The painkillers initially provided pain relief, but their effect 
wore off over time. After diagnosis, he was started on an adult ALL chemotherapy 
protocol.
OUTCOMES: His symptoms resolved within a week of starting chemotherapy. At his 
most recent assessment, 10 months after diagnosis, he was on maintenance 
chemotherapy and in remission.
LESSONS: This case illustrates that prolonged lumbosacral pain may be a symptom 
of a life-threatening condition, rather than only attributable to chronic 
inflammation or disk herniations. Therefore, clinicians need to pay attention to 
subtle differences in the clinical presentation of patients with lumbosacral 
pain.

Neuroplasticity of Sensorimotor Control in Low Back Pain.

Brumagne S, Diers M, Danneels L, Moseley GL, Hodges PW.

Low back pain (LBP) is an important medical and socioeconomic problem. Impaired 
sensorimotor control has been suggested to be a likely mechanism underlying 
development and/or maintenance of pain. Although early work focused on the 
structural and functional abnormalities within the musculoskeletal system, in 
the past 20 years there has been an increasing realization that patients with 
LBP might also have extensive neuroplastic changes within the central nervous 
system. These include changes related to both the structure (eg, gray matter 
changes) and function (eg, organization of the sensory and motor cortices) of 
the nervous system as related to processing of pain and nociception and to motor 
and somatosensory systems. Moreover, clinical interventions increasingly aim to 
drive neuroplasticity with treatments to improve pain and sensorimotor function. 
This commentary provides a contemporary overview of neuroplasticity of the 
pain/nociceptive and sensorimotor systems in LBP. This paper addresses (1) 
defining neuroplasticity in relation to control of the spine and LBP, (2) 
structural and functional nervous system changes as they relate to nonspecific 
LBP and sensorimotor function, and (3) related clinical implications. 
Individuals with recurrent and persistent LBP differ from those without LBP in 
several markers of the nervous system's function and structure. Neuroplastic 
changes may be addressed by top-down cognitive-based interventions and bottom-up 
physical interventions. An integrated clinical approach that combines 
contemporary pain neuroscience education, cognition-targeted sensorimotor 
control, and physical or function-based treatments may lead to better outcomes 
in patients with recurrent and persistent LBP. This approach will need to 
consider variation among individuals, as no single finding/mechanism is present 
in all individuals, and no single treatment that targets neuroplastic changes in 
the sensorimotor system is likely to be effective for all patients with LBP. J

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) have multifactorial and complex etiology. 
Regardless of their etiology, all those conditions may result in centrally 
mediated chronic muscle pain, myalgia, myofascial pain, myofibrotic contracture, 
myosistis, myospasm, headache and a variety of neck, shoulder, upper back and 
lower back pain. Biofeedback (BF) is one of methods that has been used for more 
than 50 years in rehabilitation to facilitate normal movement patterns after 
injuries. Some studies suggest that biofeedback may be an effective treatment 
option for patients with different muscle disorders. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate the efficiency of biofeedback in masticatory muscle activity 
management in the light of current medical literature. The authors followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 
guidelines for this systematic review. The authors searched the MEDLINE, Scopus, 
Web of Science, CINAHL databases to identify relevant publications. Finally 10 
papers were included. Most of the selected studies showed a significant 
correlation between biofeedback usage and reduction of masticatory muscle 
activity. By analyzing qualified studies, it can be concluded that biofeedback 
can be an effective tool in masticatory muscle activity management.

Our purpose was to investigate the spatial and temporal profile of the 
paraspinal muscle activation during gait in a group of 13 patients with lumbar 
instability (LI) in a pre-surgical setting compared to the results with those 
from both 13 healthy controls (HC) and a sample of 7 patients with failed back 
surgery syndrome (FBSS), which represents a chronic untreatable condition, in 
which the spine muscles function is expected to be widely impaired. 
Spatiotemporal gait parameters, trunk kinematics, and muscle activation were 
measured through a motion analysis system integrated with a surface EMG device. 
The bilateral paraspinal muscles (longissimus) at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 levels 
and lumbar iliocostalis muscles were evaluated. Statistical analysis revealed 
significant differences between groups in the step length, step width, and trunk 
bending and rotation. As regard the EMG analysis, significant differences were 
found in the cross-correlation, full-width percentage and center of activation 
values between groups, for all muscles investigated. Patients with LI, showed 
preserved trunk movements compared to HC but a series of EMG abnormalities of 
the spinal muscles, in terms of left-right symmetry, top-down synchronization, 
and spatiotemporal activation and modulation compared to the HC group. In 
patients with LI some of such EMG abnormalities regarded mainly the segment 
involved by the instability and were strictly correlated to the pain perception. 
Conversely, in patients with FBSS the EMG abnormalities regarded all the spinal 
muscles, irrespective to the segment involved, and were correlated to the 
disease's severity. Furthermore, patients with FBSS showed reduced lateral 
bending and rotation of the trunk and a reduced gait performance and balance. 
Our methodological approach to analyze the functional status of patients with LI 
due to spine disease with surgical indications, even in more complex conditions 
such as deformities, could allow to evaluate the biomechanics of the spine in 
the preoperative conditions and, in the future, to verify whether and which 
surgical procedure may either preserve or improve the spine muscle function 
during gait.

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted in order to compare the prevalence of 
inflammatory posterior arch abnormalities on lumbar spine MRI between axial 
spondyloarthritis (axSpA) patients and low back pain (LBP) patients.
METHODS: Patients-axSpA patients meeting the 2009 ASAS criteria and chronic LBP 
patients who had a lumbar spine MRI were selected. MRI-STIR and T1 sagittal 
images up to T8-T9 were reviewed by two experienced rheumatologists blinded to 
the diagnosis and clinical data to identify inflammatory posterior arch 
abnormalities. Analyses-The prevalence of inflammatory posterior arch 
abnormalities between axSpA and LBP patients was compared. Clinical data were 
compared in the axSpA group depending on whether or not inflammatory posterior 
arch abnormalities were present.
RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were enrolled in each group. The prevalence of all 
inflammatory posterior arch abnormalities was the same in the axSpA and LBP 
groups (58% in the SpA group versus 70% in the LBP group, p = 0.1). However, 
differences in terms of the prevalence of costotransverse joint arthritis, 
pedicle oedema above L3 and transverse and spinous process oedema were observed 
between the two groups (axSpA 27% versus LBP 6%, p = 0.0004). Patients with 
inflammatory posterior arch abnormalities in the axSpA group had a longer 
disease duration (11 versus 8 years, p = 0.02), higher CRP levels (median 11 
versus 3 mg/l, p = 0.0002) and higher prevalence of radiographic sacroiliitis 
(84 versus 47%, p = 0.001) compared to patients without inflammatory posterior 
arch abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Costotransverse arthritis, pedicle oedema and transverse process 
oedema are more frequent in axSpA patients than LBP patients, on lumbar spine 
MRI depicting TH9-S1.
KEY POINTS: • MRI pedicle oedema above L3, transverse process oedema, spinous 
process oedema or costotransverse arthritis is more frequently observed in axial 
spondyloarthritis (SpA). • SpA patients with at least one MRI inflammatory 
lesion on the posterior arch had higher clinical activity scores and biological 
inflammation. • Facet joint arthritis was more common in patients with chronic 
low back pain.

Using data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study, several risk 
factors predictive of imminent (2-year) risk of low-trauma non-vertebral 
fracture among high-risk women were identified, including history of falls, 
history of low-trauma fracture, poorer physical function, and lower T score. 
Careful consideration should be given to targeting this population for therapy.
PURPOSE: Fracture risk assessment has focused on a long-term horizon and 
populations with a broad risk range. For elderly women with osteoporosis or low 
bone mass, or a history of fragility fractures ("high-risk women"), risk 
prediction over a shorter horizon may have greater clinical relevance.
METHODS: A repeated-observations design and data from the Canadian Multicentre 
Osteoporosis Study were employed. Study population comprised women aged 
≥ 65 years with T score (total hip, femoral neck, spine) ≤ - 1.0 or prior 
fracture. Hazard ratios (HR) for predictors of low-trauma non-vertebral fracture 
during 2-year follow-up were estimated using multivariable shared frailty model.
RESULTS: The study population included 3228 women who contributed 5004 
observations; 4.8% experienced low-trauma non-vertebral fracture during the 
2-year follow-up. In bivariate analyses, important risk factors included age, 
back pain, history of falls, history of low-trauma fracture, physical function, 
health status, and total hip T score. In multivariable analyses, only four 
independent predictors were identified: falls in past 12 months (≥ 2 falls: 
HR = 1.9; 1 fall: HR = 1.5), low-trauma fracture in past 12 months (≥ 1 
fracture: HR = 1.7), SF-36 physical component summary score (≤ 42.0: HR = 1.6), 
and total hip T score (≤ - 3.5: HR = 3.7; > - 3.5 to ≤ - 2.5: HR = 2.5; > - 2.5 
to ≤ - 1: HR = 1.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Imminent risk of low-trauma non-vertebral fracture is elevated 
among high-risk women with a history of falls or low-trauma fracture, poorer 
physical function, and lower T score. Careful consideration should be given to 
identifying and targeting this population for therapy.

BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common health issue worldwide. Tai 
Chi, Qigong, and Yoga, as the most widely practiced mindful exercises, have 
promising effects for CLBP-specific symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: We therefore conducted a comprehensive review investigating the 
effects of mindful exercises versus active and/or non-active controls while 
evaluating the safety and pain-related effects of mindful exercises in adults 
with CLBP.
METHODS: We searched five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, 
and Cochrane Library) from inception to February 2019. Two investigators 
independently selected 17 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT) against 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by data extraction and study quality 
assessment. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to determine the 
magnitude of mindful exercises versus controls on pain- and disease-specific 
outcome measures.
RESULTS: As compared to control groups, we observed significantly favorable 
effects of mindful exercises on reducing pain intensity (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI 
-0.5 to -0.23, p < 0.001, I2 = 45.9 %) and disability (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI -0.49 
to -0.28, p < 0.001, I2 = 0 %). When compared with active control alone, mindful 
exercises showed significantly reduced pain intensity (SMD = -0.40, p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, of the three mindful exercises, Tai Chi has a significantly 
superior effect on pain management (SMD= -0.75, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.46, p < 
0.001), whereas Yoga-related adverse events were reported in five studies.
CONCLUSION: Findings of our systematic review suggest that mindful exercises 
(Tai Chi and Qigong) may be beneficial for CLBP symptomatic management. In 
particular, Tai Chi appears to have a superior effect in reducing pain intensity 
irrespective of non-control comparison or active control comparison 
(conventional exercises, core training, and physical therapy programs). 
Importantly, training in these mindful exercises should be implemented with 
certified instructors to ensure quality of movement and injury prevention.

Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of 
sustained cognitive impairment in military service members and Veterans. 
However, the mechanism of persistent cognitive deficits including working memory 
(WM) dysfunction is not fully understood in mTBI. Few studies of WM deficits in 
mTBI have taken advantage of the temporal and frequency resolution afforded by 
electromagnetic measurements. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an N-back 
WM task, we investigated functional abnormalities in combat-related mTBI. Study 
participants included 25 symptomatic active-duty service members or Veterans 
with combat-related mTBI and 20 healthy controls with similar combat 
experiences. MEG source-magnitude images were obtained for alpha (8-12 Hz), beta 
(15-30 Hz), gamma (30-90 Hz), and low-frequency (1-7 Hz) bands. Compared with 
healthy combat controls, mTBI participants showed increased MEG signals across 
frequency bands in frontal pole (FP), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), 
but decreased MEG signals in anterior cingulate cortex. Hyperactivations in FP, 
OFC, and anterior dlPFC were associated with slower reaction times. MEG 
activations in lateral FP also negatively correlated with performance on tests 
of letter sequencing, verbal fluency, and digit symbol coding. The profound 
hyperactivations from FP suggest that FP is particularly vulnerable to 
combat-related mTBI.

Objective: The aim of this meta-analytic review was to quantitatively examine 
the effects of traditional Chinese exercises (TCE) on pain intensity and back 
disability in individuals with low back pain (LBP). Methods: Potential articles 
were retrieved using seven electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of 
Science, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and 
Wanfang). The searched period was from inception to 1 March 2019. Randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of TCE on pain intensity and back 
disability in LBP patients were included. Pooled effect sizes were calculated 
using the random-effects models and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: 
Data from eleven RCTs (886 individuals with LBP) meeting the inclusion criteria 
were extracted for meta-analysis. Compared with the control intervention, TCE 
induced significant improvements in the visual analogue scale (VAS) (Hedge's g = 
-0.64, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.37, p < 0.001), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire 
(RMDQ) (Hedge's g = -0.41, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.03, p = 0.03), Oswestry Disability 
Index (ODI) (Hedge's g = -0.96, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.50, p < 0.001), and cognitive 
function (Hedge's g = -0.62, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.39, p < 0.001). In a 
meta-regression analysis, age (β = 0.01, p = 0.02) and total exercise time (β = 
-0.0002, p = 0.01) were associated with changes in the VAS scores, respectively. 
Moderator analyses demonstrated that Tai Chi practice (Hedge's g = -0.87, 95% CI 
-1.38 to -0.36, p < 0.001) and Qigong (Hedge's g = -0.54, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.23, 
p < 0.001) reduced VAS scores. Interventions with a frequency of 1-2 times/week 
(Hedge's g = -0.53, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.07, p = 0.02) and 3-4 times/week (Hedge's 
g = -0.78, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.42, p < 0.001) were associated with reduced VAS 
scores, but this significant reduction on this outcome was not observed in the 
weekly training frequency of ≥5 times (Hedge's g = -0.54, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.08, 
p = 0.09). Conclusions: TCE may have beneficial effects for reducing pain 
intensity for individuals with LBP, regardless of their pain status.

Chronic low back pain is a significant societal and personal burden that 
negatively impacts quality of life. Dog ownership has been associated with 
health benefits. This study evaluated the feasibility of surveying people with 
chronic low back pain to assess the relationship between dog ownership and 
well-being. A mail-out survey was sent to 210 adult patients with chronic low 
back pain. Measures of quality of life, pain, physical activity, emotional 
health, social ties and dog ownership were included. Feasibility was assessed by 
examining survey response rate, responses to established and newly developed 
measures, and the potential relationships between dog ownership and a number of 
key well-being variables in this patient population. There were 56 completed 
surveys returned (n = 36 non-dog owners and n = 20 dog owners). Established, 
adapted and newly developed scales revealed promising results. Dog owners 
reported fewer depression and anxiety symptoms, and more social ties than 
non-dog owners. Living with a dog may be associated with improved well-being for 
people with chronic pain. The findings from this feasibility study will inform a 
general population survey, to be conducted with a larger, more representative 
sample of people living with chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Few, if any, patient reported symptoms have been shown to be related 
to objective measures of spine function. Recently, patient-reported measures of 
disability following spinal manipulative therapy have been associated with an 
immediate decrease in spinal stiffness obtained by instrumented L3 indentation. 
Given this novel relation, we anticipate that stiffness measures obtained from 
locations in addition to L3 may yield valuable information. As such, our 
research team has developed a new technique to acquire stiffness data 
continuously over an entire spinal region. The reliability of stiffness 
measurements obtained by this new technique has yet to be quantified.
METHODS: Continuous stiffness testing employs a weighted roller that moves 
uninterrupted over the spine while measuring the resulting spinal deflection 
along a subject-specific, laser-defined trajectory. A volunteer sample of 
asymptomatic participants were assessed in 2 sessions occurring 1 to 4 days 
apart, with each session scheduled at the same time of day. Each session 
consisted of 3 trials each beginning at a baseline of ~ 17 N then progressing to 
a maximally tolerable load as defined from pre-test familiarization trials 
(~ 61, 72 or 83 N). Reliability was evaluated with the intraclass correlation 
coefficient, the standard error of measurement and Bland & Altman analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 17 asymptomatic participants (mean age 29.2 +/- 6 years, 53% 
female) took part in the study. Overall, the within and between-session 
reliability of lumbar spine stiffness measures at the maximal tolerable load was 
excellent ranging from 0.95-1.00 and good to excellent ranging from 0.82-0.93, 
respectively. Trial averaging was found to reduce standard error of measurement 
by a mean of 35.2% over all measurement conditions compared to a single trial. 
Bland and Altman plots for agreement in lumbar spine stiffness measurements 
varied from - 0.3 +/- 1.2 at unloaded condition to - 0.2 +/- 1.2 at loaded 
condition. Data from two participants were removed due to the development of 
back pain between two sessions.
CONCLUSION: This study introduced a new technique for measuring spinal stiffness 
over an entire spinal region in asymptomatic human participants. The new 
technique produced reliable measurements quantifying the load-displacement 
values for within-session and between-session assessments.

BACKGROUND: Anterior sacral meningocele (ASM) is characterized by a herniation 
of the dural sac through a bony defect of the anterior sacral wall. Symptoms of 
ASMs are usually directly related to their mass effect on the adjacent pelvic 
structures, often causing chronic constipation and urinary disturbances. The 
low-dysplastic spondylolisthesis results from congenital abnormalities of the 
upper sacral facets or the neural arch of L5. Its symptoms are related to neural 
compression and/or segmental instability. The main aim of this case report is to 
present a patient who underwent surgery for low dysplastic spondylolisthesis 
combined with an ASM that were both considered symptomatic.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old male patient, with no medical history, no signs 
of neurologic deficit was admitted for lower back pain and irritation, numbness 
and paresthesia in the L5 dermatomes bilaterally, together with alternating 
constipation and diarrhea with no response to conservative treatment. Computed 
tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine and pelvis showing 
a large retroperitoneal mass with fluid contend causing compression and 
displacement of the pelvic structures, in particular the bladder and the colon 
and there was also a low-dysplastic spondylolisthesis of L5/S1 with pressure on 
both L5 nerve roots. Surgery was done in one session purely from a posterior 
approach with no complications.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, we have demonstrated the suitability of a 
standard midline posterior approach in the treatment not only for ASM itself, 
but also for a low-dysplastic spondylolisthesis in 1 session.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the spine can be 
a challenge because of their complex presentations. We present an uncommon case 
of congenital deformity of the spine with L4-L5 vertebral fusion, mimicking a 
single vertebra, and L3 spondylolisthesis treated by oblique lumbar interbody 
fusion (OLIF).
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman presented with increasing lower back pain 
radiating to the left leg, with aggravation of symptoms for the past 6 months, 
causing difficulty in walking. She also complained of paresthesia along the 
L3-L5 dermatomes in both legs, with more prominence on the left side. Imaging 
revealed fusion deformity of the L4-L5 vertebrae, as well as degenerative 
spondylolisthesis at the L3-L4 level. After treatment with OLIF, the patient had 
an uneventful recovery period. Comparisons were made between the preoperative 
and 6-month follow-up visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index 
scores. The patient showed significant improvement in the scores, as well as in 
her symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: OLIF is a promising technique that can be applied in the management 
of degenerative disk diseases and also for deformities that may be formidable to 
treat by adopting the traditional posterior approach.

Sacral insufficiency fractures (SIFs) are common in the elderly. In patients 
with SIF, objective neurological abnormalities such as sphincter dysfunction or 
leg paresthesia are uncommon. We present a case of SIF accompanied by 
spinopelvic dissociation with late neurological compromise treated by 
spinopelvic fixation. A 61-year-old woman presented to our hospital with low 
back pain without obvious trauma history. She had a past history of eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis and treatment with steroids. Her low back pain 
became worse, and she started to have radiating left posterior thigh pain and 
motor weakness in the left ankle and both great toes with symptoms of stress 
urinary incontinence, constipation, and loss of anal sensation. Magnetic 
resonance imaging revealed an H-shaped sacrum fracture. We attributed the 
neurological symptoms to unstable SIF and performed lumbopelvic fixation. After 
the surgery, her leg pain and symptoms of stress urinary incontinence improved 
markedly, as did anal sensation. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient reported no 
low back pain and she was walking independently without pelvic complaints. CT 
showed bone union was achieved. Even minimally displaced SIF in patients with 
osteoporosis can be a cause of bowel and bladder disturbance. Lumbopelvic 
fixation is a treatment option for SIF with spinopelvic dissociation presenting 
neurological deficit.

Progressive sacroiliitis due to accessory sacroiliac joint mimicking ankylosing 
spondylitis: A case report.

Song R(1), Lee S, Lee SH.

Author information:
(1)Department of Rheumatology, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, School 
of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.

RATIONALE: An accessory sacroiliac (SI) joint usually has little clinical 
significance. However, severe arthritic changes can cause chronic buttock or low 
back pain and can be misdiagnosed as another disease presenting with 
sacroiliitis such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 33-year-old woman was diagnosed with AS due to chronic 
buttock pain and progressive sacroiliitis on plain X-ray and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). Her buttock and low back pain gradually worsened despite proper 
treatment for AS.
DIAGNOSIS: Computed tomography revealed an accessory SI joint with arthritic 
changes.
INTERVENTIONS: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and restricted 
movement were prescribed.
OUTCOMES: The symptoms were controlled with NSAIDs, rest, and restriction of 
excessive movement. The medication could be stopped after the pain subsided.
LESSONS: An accessory SI joint can be a cause of chronic back pain and can be 
misdiagnosed as AS with sacroiliitis when progressive arthritic changes are 
observed. Therefore, additional imaging studies other than conventional X-ray or 
MRI may be required for accurate diagnosis.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the multi-dimensional 
characteristics of lumbar endplate defects in humans in relation to disc 
degeneration and other MRI phenotypes as well as their role with pain and 
disability. A total of 108 subjects were recruited and underwent 3T MRI of the 
lumbar spine. Structural endplate defects were identified and their dimensions 
were measured in terms of maximum width and depth, and were then standardized to 
the actual width of the endplate and depth of the vertebral body, respectively. 
Both width and depth of all endplate defects in each subject were added 
separately and scores were assigned on the basis of size from 1 to 3. Combining 
both scores provided "cumulative endplate defect scores." Disc degeneration 
scores, Modic changes, disc displacement, HIZ, and facet joint changes were 
assessed. Subject demographics, pain profile, and Oswestry Disability Index 
(ODI) were also obtained. Endplate defects were observed in 67.5% of the 
subjects and in 13.5% of the endplates. All dimensions of endplate defects 
showed significance with disc degenerative scores, Modic changes, and posterior 
disc displacement (p < 0.05). Maximum width (p = 0.009) and its standardized 
value (p = 0.02), and cumulative endplate defect scores (p = 0.004) increased 
with narrow facet joints. Cumulative endplate defect scores showed a strong 
positive association with ODI (p < 0.05) compared to disc degenerative scores. 
Large size endplate defects were strongly associated with degenerative spine 
changes and more back-related disability. Findings from this study stress the 
need to assess endplate findings from a multi-dimensional perspective, whose 
role may have clinical utility. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published

EBV associated nervous system complications includes encephalitis, meningitis, 
cerebellitis, polyradiculomyelitis, transverse myelitis, cranial and peripheral 
neuropathies, and psychiatric abnormalities are usually more commonly seen in 
immunocompromised patients and rarely in immunocompetent patients. Here we are 
reporting a 13 years old boy developed headache, malaise, sore throat and low 
back pain with radiation to both lower limbs. Next day he felt numbness below 
umbilicus followed by acute onset weakness in both lower limbs and urinary 
retention. Motor exam revealed proximal muscle power MRC grade 4/5 and distal 
power 1/5 in right lower limb and proximal power 4-/5 and distal power 0/5 in 
left lower limb with normal power in both upper limbs. Deep tendon reflexes were 
bilaterally normal except absent ankle reflexes. Both plantars were mute. All 
the modalities of sensation including pain, touch, temperature, joint position 
and vibration were impaired below umbilicus. Routine investigations were normal. 
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thoracic spine showed intramedullary 
lesion in conus, which was iso-hyperintense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on 
T2- weighted images extending from D12thoracic vertebral level to L1 with cord 
expansion (Figures 1, 2). The MRI features were suggestive of conus myelitis. 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed increased protein, normal cells, 
glucose and Chloride. CSF Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for 
Epstein Barr virus . The clinical and imaging findings were consistent with the 
diagnosis of myelitis and responded well to steroid plus acyclovir treatment. 
The clinicians should be aware of such uncommon etiology of a common disease.

Severe Coronary Artery Disease Disguised as Myocarditis.

(1)Internal Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, USA.

Serum troponin is a marker of cardiac myocyte damage that is typically used to 
assess for myocardial infarction in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. 
However, many conditions, including cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, or 
myocarditis, can cause an elevation in serum troponin. The most common use of 
this tool is to determine whether acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is occurring, 
but other differentials include cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, and even 
acute heart failure. We present the case of a patient who presented with 
symptoms consistent with viral myocarditis but ultimately was found to have 
severe coronary artery disease (CAD). A 33-year-old Caucasian male with no 
cardiac risk factors other than a five-pack year smoking history, presented with 
progressively worsening upper respiratory symptoms, including sore throat and a 
non-productive cough that began a few weeks ago. These symptoms were associated 
with fevers, and 24 hours prior to admission, he developed intermittent chest 
pain at rest, radiating to the back, worsening in the supine position. In the 
emergency room (ER), the patient was found to have an elevated serum troponin of 
15.61 ng/L (normal <0.05 ng/L). The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed T-wave 
inversions in the lateral leads. Based on his presentation and age, there was a 
high suspicion of viral myocarditis. However, non-ST elevation myocardial 
infarction (NSTEMI) had not yet been ruled out and the patient was started on 
started on a heparin infusion per the ACS protocol. A transthoracic 
echocardiogram showed wall motion abnormalities with low-normal left ventricular 
ejection fraction. A coronary angiogram showed severe CAD and he underwent 
staged a percutaneous coronary intervention with the resolution of symptoms. CAD 
and viral myocarditis, at times, can share common presenting symptoms, EKG 
changes, and laboratory findings. Out of all possible diagnoses, an elevation in 
serum troponin correlates to an MI up to 60% of the time. Myocarditis is the 
second leading cause of troponin elevation and accounts for 25% of cases. We 
highlight this case to discuss the importance of maintaining a broad 
differential and pursuing complete work-up when treating younger patients with 
chest pain and elevated serum troponin who lack typical risk factors for CAD.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) improves sleep in chronic low back pain 
(CLBP).
BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty over the effectiveness of TENS in CLBP. In most 
studies, pain intensity has been the primary outcome measure. Although sleep 
abnormalities are common in CLBP, sleep outcomes have not been evaluated in most 
studies of TENS effectiveness. Subjective and objective sleep measures are often 
inconsistent in CLBP, suggesting that perception of sleep and actual sleep may 
differ.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated TENS for CLBP over 10 weeks. 
The source database included demographics, pain characteristics, pain intensity 
and interference on an 11-point numerical rating scale, adherence and 
actigraphic sleep data from real-world TENS users. Key inclusion criteria were 
CLBP with self-reported history of back injury and baseline pain interference 
with sleep ≥4. Study participants were stratified into improved and unimproved 
groups based on changes in pain interference with sleep (improved ≥1-point 
decrease). Actigraphic sleep metrics were compared between the two groups for 
weeks 1-2 and weeks 9-10.
RESULTS: The inclusion criteria were met by 554 TENS users. There were 282 
(50.9%) participants in the improved group and 272 (49.1%) in the unimproved 
group. The two groups had similar baseline characteristics and high TENS 
adherence. At the weeks 1-2 assessment, there were no differences among 
actigraphic sleep. At the weeks 9-10 assessment, there was a difference in total 
sleep time, with the improved group sleeping 29 minutes longer. In addition, the 
periodic leg movement (PLM) index was lower in the improved group.
CONCLUSION: Regular TENS improved self-reported and objective sleep measures in 
individuals with CLBP. When compared to the unimproved group, the improved group 
had longer total sleep time and fewer PLMs. Sleep may be an important outcome 
for TENS effectiveness in CLBP.

Disc height has been a focus of research on disc degeneration and low back pain 
(LBP). However, choosing an appropriate method to quantify disc height remains 
controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the reliability and 
construct validity of disc height quantification methods. Repeated 
semi-automatic measurements of L4-5 and L5-S1 discs were obtained from 43 
T2-weighted mid-sagittal 3T magnetic resonance (MR) images of 22 subjects with 
LBP (43±13 years), blinded to prior measurements. Heights were calculated with 
area-based methods (using 60%, 80% and 100% of the disc width), and point-based 
methods (Hurxthal's, Dabbs' and combining the two). Intra-class correlation 
coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were estimated. 
Construct validity was assessed using correlation coefficients. Intra-rater 
ICC(3,1) of the area-based disc height measurements ranged from 0.84 to 0.99 
with an inter-rater ICC(2,1) of 0.99. Measurements with point-based methods had 
lower intra- and inter-rater reliability ranging between 0.76 and 0.96 and 
between 0.84 and 0.98, respectively. Inter-rater SEM varied between 0.2 and 0.3 
mm for area-based methods and between 0.3 and 0.7 mm for point-based methods. 
Excluding Dabbs', high correlations (r>0.9) were observed between methods. 
Area-based height measurements using partial disc width demonstrated excellent 
reliability and construct validity and outperformed point-based methods.

BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to define the role for surgery in 
the treatment of chronic low back pain (cLBP) and to develop a new 
classification of cLBP based on the pattern of injury.
HYPOTHESIS: Surgery may benefit patients with cLBP, and a new classification 
based on the injury pattern may be of interest.
METHOD: A systematic literature review was performed by searching Medline, the 
Cochrane Library, the French public health database (Banque de Données en Santé 
Publique), Science Direct, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse. The main 
search terms were "back pain" OR "lumbar" OR "intervertebral disc replacement" 
OR "vertebrae" OR "spinal" AND "surgery" OR "surgical" OR "fusion" OR 
"laminectomy" OR "discectomy".
RESULTS: Surgical techniques available for treating cLBP consist of fusion, disc 
replacement, dynamic stabilisation, and inter-spinous posterior devices. 
Compared to non-operative management including intensive rehabilitation therapy 
and cognitive behavioural therapy, fusion is not better in terms of either 
function (evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]) or pain (level 
2). Fusion is better than non-operative management without intensive 
rehabilitation therapy (level 2). There is no evidence to date that one fusion 
technique is superior over the others regarding the clinical outcomes (assessed 
using the ODI). Compared to fusion or multidisciplinary rehabilitation therapy, 
disc replacement can produce better function and less pain, although the 
differences are not clinically significant (level 2). The available evidence 
does not support the use of dynamic stabilisation or interspinous posterior 
devices to treat cLBP due to degenerative disease (professional consensus within 
the French Society for Spinal Surgery). The following recommendations can be 
made: non-operative treatment must be provided for at least 1 year before 
considering surgery in patients with cLBP due to degenerative disease; patients 
must be fully informed about alternative treatment options and the risks 
associated with surgery; standing radiographs must be obtained to assess 
sagittal spinal alignment and a magnetic resonance imaging scan to determine the 
mechanism of injury; and, if fusion is performed, the lumbar lordotic curvature 
must be restored.
DISCUSSION: This work establishes the need for a new classification of cLBP 
based on the presumptive mechanism responsible for the pain. Three categories 
should be distinguished: non-degenerative cLBP (previously known as symptomatic 
cLBP), in which the cause of pain is a trauma, spondylolysis, a tumour, an 
infection, or an inflammatory process; degenerative cLBP (previously known as 
non-specific cLBP) characterised by variable combinations of degenerative 
alterations in one or more discs, facet joints, and/or ligaments, with or 
without regional and/or global alterations in spinal alignment (which must be 
assessed using specific parameters); and cLBP of unknown mechanism, in which the 
pain seems to bear no relation to the anatomical abnormalities (and the 
Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
may be helpful in this situation). This classification should prove useful in 
the future for constituting well-defined patient groups, thereby improving the 
assessment of treatment options.

STUDY DESIGN: Case control study.
PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and degree of asymptomatic cervical and 
lumbar facet joint arthritis. We retrospectively reviewed 500 computed 
tomography (CT) scans of cervical facet joints obtained from 50 subjects. 
Moreover, 500 lumbar facet joints obtained from an additional 50 subjects were 
reviewed.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Numerous reports in the literature indicate that joint 
arthritis is a major source of axial neck and low back pain. However, the 
diagnostic value of this condition, based on degenerative changes seen on 
radiological studies, remains controversial because significant imaging findings 
may not correlate with corresponding symptoms. The CT scan is a sensitive method 
for facet joint evaluation and may reveal degenerative abnormalities. Previous 
studies have described the prevalence of facet arthropathy in symptomatic 
patients, according to radiological findings; however, no study to date has 
assessed its prevalence in asymptomatic patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the neck and abdominal CT scans of patients 
had been examined for non-spinal pathologies (i.e., thyroid disease, rule out 
cancer, ascites). Electronic medical records were reviewed to exclude patients 
with histories of either neck or back pain. Arthritis severity was graded using 
a previously published four-point CT scale.
RESULTS: The prevalence of asymptomatic cervical facet arthritis (grade 1-3) was 
33% (grade 1, 19%; grade 2, 11%; and grade 3, 3%). Among asymptomatic patients, 
37% had scalable lumbar facet join arthritis (grade 1, 24%; grade 2, 9%; and 
grade 3, 4%). There was a statistically significant difference (chi-square test, 
p<0.0001) in the number of older individuals with arthritic degeneration at the 
cervical and lumbar levels compared with that of younger individuals. The C6-C7 
and L5-S1 levels were the most likely to show arthritic changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthritic changes to the cervical and lumbar facet joints are 
prevalent among patients, and in some cases are asymptomatic. These findings 
were more common in older patients and at lower spinal levels.

Spontaneous Intracranial and Lumbar Subdural Hematoma Presenting as Vaginal 
Pain.

BACKGROUND: Spontaneous spinal and intracranial subdural hematomas are rarely 
reported, especially occurring simultaneously. Anticoagulation use has been 
associated with spontaneous hemorrhages. Prompt diagnosis is required to prevent 
permanent neurological sequelae. In this case report, we describe a spontaneous 
spinal and intracranial subdural hematoma in a woman taking warfarin and 
initially presenting with severe vaginal pain.
CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old woman who had a history of mechanical valve 
replacement and was therefore taking warfarin, came to an emergency department 
for relief of severe vaginal pain. Mild concurrent lumbar pain increased concern 
about spinal pathology, so magnetic resonance imaging of her spine was 
performed. It revealed a subdural hematoma extending from L1-S1 with 
arachnoiditis, which suggested intracranial pathology, though the patient had no 
complaint of a headache. Computed tomography of her brain demonstrated a large 
right subdural hemorrhage with midline shift. Subsequent imaging revealed no 
aneurysm or source of the intracranial bleeding. We concluded that the patient 
experienced spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracranial hemorrhage 
resulting in lumbar subdural hematoma and arachnoiditis with referred vaginal 
pain. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Pelvic, vaginal, or 
perineal pain may be the presenting symptom in patients with lower spinal 
pathology. It is important to consider causes other than gynecological ones in 
the differential diagnosis of these patients, as well as to be cognizant of the 
relationship between spinal and intracranial subdural hemorrhages. In patients 
with back pain or radiating lumbar pain, especially coupled with neurological 
effects, clinicians should consider spinal subdural hemorrhage and arachnoiditis 
to expedite imaging studies and treatment of these rare entities.

The role of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-κB) has been highlighted in mechanisms underlying inflammatory and 
neuropathic pain processes. The present study was designed to investigate 
whether NF-κB signaling is associated with pain-related neuropeptide expression 
in patients with chronic back pain related to degenerative disc disease (DDD). 
Intervertebral disc (IVD) tissues were collected from forty DDD patients 
undergoing disc replacement or fusion surgery, and from eighteen postmortem (PM) 
control subjects. RELA, NFKB1, CGRP, TAC1, TRPV1, and MMP-3 gene expression were 
analyzed by RT-qPCR, while NF-κB subunit RelA and NF-κB1⁻DNA binding in nuclear 
extracts and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and 
transient receptor potential, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) protein levels in 
cytosolic extracts of tissues were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). An upregulated NF-κB1⁻DNA binding, and higher CGRP and TRPV1 protein 
levels were observed in DDD patients compared to PM controls. In DDD patients, 
NF-κB1⁻DNA binding was positively correlated with nuclear RelA levels. Moreover, 
NF-κB1⁻DNA binding was positively associated with TRPV1 and MMP-3 gene and SP 
and TRPV1 protein expression in DDD patients. Our results indicate that the 
expression of SP and TRPV1 in IVD tissues was associated with NF-κB activation. 
Moreover, NF-κB may be involved in the generation or maintenance of peripheral 
pain mechanisms by the regulation of pain-related neuropeptide expression in DDD 
patients.

Low back pain results in more global disabilities than any other condition, and 
intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is commonly involved in the etiology. 
Supplementation of IVDs with reparative cells is a rational strategy to address 
such clinical problems. We have previously developed a scaffold-free 
tissue-engineered construct (TEC) as a novel cell therapy system for repair of 
articular cartilage and meniscus. We now show the regenerative potential of 
adipose mesenchymal stem cells derived TEC (ADSC-TEC) for IVD degeneration using 
a rat tail model of total nucleotomy. The regenerative efficacy of ASDC-TEC was 
investigated structurally and biomechanically up to 6 months after implantation. 
ADSC-TEC implantation into IVDs preserved the disc height, endplate, and annulus 
fibrosus structure, and showed similar biomechanical characteristics to the sham 
group at postoperative 6 weeks. The structure of regenerated IVD was maintained 
until 6 months. Furthermore, ADSC-TEC implantation attenuated the impact of 
age-related biomechanical deterioration when assessed at 6 months 
post-implantation. These results demonstrate that use of ADSC-TECs can be an 
effective treatment for IVD degeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We 
developed adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived scaffold-free tissue engineered 
construct (ADSC-TEC) as a novel cell therapy system. The ADSC-TEC implantation 
into a rat total-nucleotomized disc space regenerated intervertebral discs 
(IVDs) histologically and biomechanically. The regenerative capacity of the 
ADSC-TEC was exerted by its trophic effects on annulus fibrosus cells and the 
load-sharing effect at intervertebral space. Interestingly, the regenerated IVDs 
by the ADSC-TEC was less susceptible to the age-related deterioration than the 
IVDs of normal rats. Thus, the application of ADSC-TEC into the degenerated disc 
can be an alternative therapy for various disease associated with structural and 
functional failure of IVDs.

BACKGROUND: The ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh not only contributes 
to the nation's economic development, but has created income opportunities for 
women, benefiting their whole family. However, these benefits come at 
considerable cost to the women. This research examines how the work environment 
and gendered family role in this conservative society affect the health of the 
female industrial workers.
METHODS: A qualitative study employed in-depth interviews (n-20) and focus group 
discussions with female garment workers (n-4) in two cities of Dhaka district. 
Further, key informant interviews (n = 4) with factory doctors, along with eight 
workplace observations were conducted to explore the lived experience of female 
workers' health issues. Interview transcripts were coded in Atlas-ti, 5.2. The 
data were analysed using thematic analysis approach. The themes are illustrated 
with case narratives.
RESULTS: The female workers reported that their work has led to back and joint 
pain, continuous headache, eye pain and difficulty in breathing associated with 
inhaling fabric dust. Inadequate lighting, constantly sitting in one position 
without back rest and continuous noise from hundreds of machines makes them feel 
permanently tired. Further, the female workers reported that working in the 
factory and meeting the expectations of the families at home has doubled their 
workload. The doctors indicated that the physical work environment, their low 
job status and the nature of the job affect the health of female workers.
CONCLUSION: This study found that female workers in the ready-made garment 
industry face a high risk of health problems. Both government and non-government 
organizations need to be better involved in designing interventions targeting 
these women, to protect them from such health risks. In addition, recognition by 
the whole society of the important role the women play in the economy is needed, 
so that support by both family and society can be improved.

INTRODUCTION: Abnormalities of the lumbar nerve tract caused by congenital 
variations or high nerve root take-off angles are difficult to visualize. 
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance neurography (DW-MRN) has recently been 
introduced for imaging of the lumbosacral region. The aims of this study were to 
identify lumbar nerve tract abnormalities caused by congenital variation or a 
high nerve root take-off angle using DW-MRN and to assess the diagnostic value 
of this imaging modality.
METHODS: A total of 573 magnetic resonance images from 575 patients (261 men, 
314 women; mean age 58.5 years) with low back/leg pain were retrospectively 
analyzed. We classified congenital variations in the lumbar nerve roots using 
the Neidre and MacNab criteria and investigated nerve roots with a take-off 
angle of 60° or more.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Congenital variations were identified in 8 patients (9 
nerve roots, 1.6%). The most commonly identified variation was in the sacral 
nerve root (n = 5) followed by the L4 (n = 3) and L5 (n = 1) nerve roots. All 
variations identified were on the left side. There were 3 cases of type 1a 
variation, 1 of type 1b, 1 of type 2, and 4 of type 3. In total, 210 (36.6%) of 
the magnetic resonance images showed high nerve root take-off angles at the 
intervertebral foramen that was caused by disk herniation, spondylolisthesis, or 
osteophytes with degeneration. Patients with high nerve root take-off angles 
were significantly older than those without (P < 0.05). These slides can be 
retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

BACKGROUND: Unlike traditional East Asian medicine, the necessity of health care 
services for cold extremities is yet to be acknowledged in Western medicine. In 
this study, we aimed to conduct an epidemiological evaluation of this 
unremarkable symptom among women in Japan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2016 
to April 2017, and data of 238 women throughout Japan were analyzed. 
Questionnaires were used to examine participants' demographics, health-related 
behaviors, health status, and frequency of subjective symptoms over the past 1 
year. The association between cold extremities and other subjective symptoms was 
examined by the multiple logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The prevalences of mild and severe cold extremities were 49.6% and 
35.3%, respectively. Temperature and utilization of health care services were 
not significantly different by the severity of cold extremities. The 
accompanying symptoms that were significantly associated with the cold 
extremities were shoulder stiffness, fatigue, low back pain, headache, nasal 
congestion, itching, injury, and difficulty hearing. After multiple logistic 
regression analysis, low back pain (OR: 4.91) and difficulty hearing (OR: 4.84) 
kept the significance. Factors related to cold extremities including mental 
quality of life, sleep quality, and habitual drinking were significantly 
associated with other accompanying symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Women with cold extremities have various accompanying symptoms and 
health-risk behaviors. Symptomatic treatment for cold extremities may not be 
sufficient, and comprehensive care would be required.

BACKGROUND: The case report is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
embolization of a high-output idiopathic renal arteriovenous fistula (IRAVF) 
with an atrial septal defect occluder (ASDO) via venous access.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old male diagnosed with high-output IRAVF received 
embolization with an ASDO via renal venous access and compact occlusion with 3 
vascular plugs and a detachable elastic coil. The IRAVF was successfully 
occluded. After a follow-up of 2 months, renal arterial computed tomography 
angiography (CTA) showed the precise location of the ASDO. No complications were 
observed after 2 years' follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on present results, embolization of a high-output IRAVF with 
an ASDO via venous access might be an efficient and safe method.

What do you expect? Catastrophizing mediates associations between expectancies 
and pain-facilitatory processes.

BACKGROUND: Pain expectancies are associated with altered pain sensitivity in 
individuals with chronic pain. However, little is known about the processes by 
which pain expectancies impact pain processing. This study assessed the 
association between pain expectancies and temporal summation (TS) of pain, and 
examined whether pain catastrophizing mediated this association.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants (437 chronic low back pain 
[CLBP] patients, 115 controls) completed self-report measures of pain intensity, 
pain expectancies and pain catastrophizing before undergoing psychophysical 
pain-testing procedures designed to assess mechanical TS of mechanical pain. 
Pearson's correlations examined the associations between study variables in CLBP 
patients and controls. Bootstrapping mediation analyses assessed the mediating 
role of pain catastrophizing on the association between pain expectancies and TS 
of pain.
RESULTS: Temporal summation of pain was significantly associated with pain 
expectancies (r = 0.113) and pain catastrophizing (r = 0.171) in CLBP patients. 
Results of mediation analyses revealed that pain catastrophizing mediated the 
relationship between pain expectancies and TS of pain in CLBP patients 
(ab = 0.309, 95% CI = 0.1222-0.5604), but not in healthy controls (ab = -0.125, 
95% CI = -0.5864 to 0.0244).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that compared to controls, 
CLBP patients show increased sensitivity to mechanical pain procedures and 
enhanced pain-facilitatory processing, proving further evidence for changes in 
central nervous system pain processing in CLBP patients. Our results also 
suggest that pain catastrophizing may be the mechanism by which pain 
expectancies are associated with TS of pain in CLBP patients.
SIGNIFICANCE: Individuals with chronic low back pain who expect higher levels of 
pain and catastrophize about their pain are more likely to experience altered 
pain sensitivity. Our results point to catastrophizing as a mechanism of action 
through which psychological factors may operate and lead to the development and 
maintenance of chronic low back pain.

PURPOSE: Our prior study revealed that people with non-specific low back pain 
(LBP) who self-reported a > 30% improvement in disability after SMT demonstrated 
significant post-treatment improvements in spinal stiffness, dynamic muscle 
thickness and disc diffusion, while those not having self-reported improvement 
did not have these objective changes. The mechanism underlying this differential 
post-SMT response remains unknown. This exploratory secondary analysis aimed to 
determine whether persons with non-specific LBP who respond to spinal SMT have 
unique lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings compared to SMT 
non-responders.
METHODS: Thirty-two participants with non-specific LBP received lumbar MRI 
before and after SMT on Day 1. Resulting images were assessed for facet 
degeneration, disc degeneration, Modic changes and apparent diffusion 
coefficient (ADC). SMT was provided again on Day 4 without imaging. SMT 
responders were classified as having a ≥ 30% reduction in their modified 
Oswestry disability index at Day 7. Baseline MRI findings between responders and 
non-responders were compared. The associations between SMT responder status and 
the presence/absence of post-SMT increases in ADC values of discs associated 
with painful/non-painful segments as determined by palpation were calculated. In 
this secondary analysis, a statistical trend was considered as a P value between 
0.05 and 0.10.
RESULTS: Although there was no significant between-group difference in all 
spinal degenerative features (e.g. Modic changes), SMT responders tended to have 
a lower prevalence of severely degenerated facets (P = 0.05) and higher baseline 
ADC values at the L4-5 disc when compared to SMT non-responders (P = 0.09). Post 
hoc analyses revealed that 180 patients per group should have been recruited to 
find significant between-group differences in the two features. SMT responders 
were also characterized by significant increases in post-SMT ADC values at discs 
associated with painful segments identified by palpation (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The current secondary analysis suggests that the spines of SMT 
responders appear to differ from non-responders with respect to degeneration 
changes in posterior joints and disc diffusion. Although this analysis was 
preliminary, it provides a new direction to investigate the mechanisms 
underlying SMT and the existence of discrete forms of treatment-specific LBP.

INTRODUCTION: Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is a common malformation of lamina of 
the spine, most commonly occurring in the sacrum or lower lumbar spine. Athletes 
with anatomical abnormalities such as SBO may be vulnerable to discoordination 
of muscles and/or skeletal structures.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 15- year-old male adolescent who presented 
with persistent low back pain (LBP) associated with SBO at T11-L1 that had been 
overlooked for several years. He participated in karate as a top-level 
competitor at the nationallevel, but the LBP interfered with his play. Dynamic 
X-ray films showed limited range of motion (ROM) in his lower lumbar spine 
(L3-S1). Instead, the thoracolumbar junction compensated for the lack of ROM in 
the lumbar spine,enabling trunk flexion and extension. To restore normal 
coordination, he was treated with a 2-week rehabilitation program including 
flexibility and core conditioning for the trunk to improve coordination of 
spinal movement. Two weeks later, his LBP resolved.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that evaluation of the coordination of the 
muscles and skeletal structures has an important role in the treatment of cases 
with an anatomical abnormality such as SBO. J.Med.Invest.66:199-200, February,

Infectious sacroiliitis is an infection of the sacroiliac joint, not easy to 
diagnose because of its non-specific signs, symptoms and laboratory 
abnormalities. We describe a case of a 16 year-old male with 5 days' history of 
fever, abdominal pain, constipation, low-back and left hip pain extended to the 
left knee associated with sudden inability to walk. In the first place, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) examination of his sacroiliac joint revealed an enlarged 
corpuscolated fluid collection near the left iliopsoas muscle, extended to 
homolateral paravertebral muscles and a little fluid at the left sacroiliac 
joint. Drainage by aspiration of the iliopsoas abscess was applied; 
Staphylococcus aureus was found in the aspirated fluid and isolated from the 
blood too. Therefore intravenous antibiotic therapy was begun. Follow-up MRI 
exams confirmed the muscle abscess and revealed also a spongy bone edema of the 
left sacroiliac joint, persisting despite the disappearance of symptoms and the 
normalization of inflammatory values. It is important to make an early diagnosis 
of infectious sacroiliitis in order to begin antibiotic therapy as soon as 
possible, because of the increasing morbidity of infection of sacroiliac joint. 
In our case MR findings have provided significant orientation towards the final 
diagnosis of infectious sacroiliitis.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the prevalence of subtypes of congenital lumbosacral 
transition vertebra (LSTV) in young male populations with low back pain (LBP) 
and their relationship to lumbar disc and facet degeneration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1875 patients (male, aged; 18-40 years) with LBP were 
investigated retrospectively. Standard lumbar MRI protocol of sagittal, and 
axial T1 weighted images (WI) and T2 WI and coronal short tau inversion recovery 
(STIR) T2 WI were obtained. Castellvi classification of LSTV were used for 
subtyping. The level and above the level of LSTV were evaluated for the lumbar 
disc space and facet degeneration based on grading methods which compares 
subtype groups with each other.
RESULTS: Prevalence of LSTV was 32% (600 of 1875). The most frequent LSTV types 
were type I (dysplastic enlarged transverse process; 66.5%) and type II 
(pseudoarticulation; 21.8%). Eight percent of the patients were type III 
(fusion) and 3.6% patients type IV (one transverse process fused and one with 
pseudoarticulation). The most commonly detected LSTV types were type I + II 
(88%) and all bilateral LSTV types were seen much more than unilateral types 
(bilateral versus unilateral 63.2%, 33.2%). The LSTV type I highly correlated 
with the disc degeneration and facet arthrosis. But the groups with higher grade 
of disc degeneration were type IV and III.
CONCLUSION: In young male patients with LBP, LSTV was found to be high in 
frequency and mostly occurred to be subtype I. LSTV type I and associated disk 
and facet degeneration were found to be remarkable in this group. Coronal T2 
STIR images are useful in showing lumbosacral region anomalies and variants, and 
should be included in the routine lumbar MRI protocol.

Acute low back pain, defined as less than 6 weeks in duration, does not require 
imaging in the absence of "red flags" that may indicate a cause, such as 
fracture, infection, or malignancy. When imaging is indicated, it is important 
to rule out a host of abnormalities that may be responsible for the pain and any 
associated symptoms. A common mnemonic VINDICATE can help ensure a thorough 
consideration of the possible causes.

A 27-year-old married man with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) 
complaining low back pain due to a spontaneous iliopsoas hematoma is reported. A 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis.The patient was managed 
conservatively. The mechanism of spontaneous iliopsoas hematoma was unclear, 
although tearing of muscle fibers, unrecognized minor trauma, low platelet 
count, secondary to hypersplenism, and severe liver iron overload, associated to 
abnormalities of clotting factors synthesis, were the suspected etiologies.  He 
showed a good response to treatment and was discharged home 11 days later. A new 
MRI, performed 7 months later, showed a complete resolution of hematoma. 
Although iliopsoas haematoma is an uncommon complication in patients with TDT, 
it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with back 
pain.

University in Rabat, Morocco.

BACKGROUND: Primary psoas abscess is an unusual clinical entity rarely 
encountered in the postpartum period. Only seven cases have been reported to 
date. Here, we present a woman with a primary psoas abscess caused by 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and occurred 2 months following a normal vaginal 
birth. We highlight the difficulties in the management of this uncommon 
condition in light of the relevant literature.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old woman who was previously healthy was presented 
at 2 months' postpartum with important right sciatica and low back pain without 
fever. Examination of the abdomen revealed tenderness in the right iliac fossa 
but obstetric/gynecologic and neurologic examinations were normal. The patient 
had an elevated C-reactive protein level and computed tomography (CT)-scan 
demonstrated a large psoas abscess on the right side without sacroiliac or spine 
abnormalities. Initial posterior lumbar percutaneous drainage was useful, but no 
pathogens were identified. The patient was discharged home with oral antibiotics 
therapy (amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole). Four weeks later, the 
follow-up CT-scan showed a re-accumulation of the abscess cavity. Subsequently, 
the patient underwent a right anterolateral laparotomy with a retroperitoneal 
approach for abscess drainage. Again, no microorganisms were found. However, 
diagnosis of tuberculosis was established on histopathologic study. She was 
successfully treated with antituberculous drugs with a good outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Most primary psoas abscesses present with a delay in diagnosis 
because of the rarity of this infectious disease, the lack of specific symptoms 
and signs, and its similarity to many differential diagnoses. When suspected, 
CT-scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging help in making an accurate diagnosis 
and facilitate percutaneous or open surgical drainage of the abscess. Correct 
and fast identification of the microorganisms in addition to appropriate usage 
of antibiotic regimen improves the outcome.

Kanagawa, Japan.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare case of intravascular papillary endothelial 
hyperplasia (IPEH), also called as Masson's tumor, in a patient with the cauda 
equina syndrome presenting with low back pain and leg pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are no studies that have reported a case of 
IPEH within the cauda equina.
METHODS: A 40-year-old man with no prior medical history presented with low back 
pain and leg pain beginning approximately 5 years ago and a month ago, 
respectively. MRI revealed a mass at the L2-L3 level that was isointense on 
T1-weighted images and hypointense with partial areas of high signal intensity 
on T2-weighted images. A myelogram demonstrated an intradural lesion without any 
respiratory fluctuation of tumor position, thereby suggesting a metastatic 
lesion; however, no abnormalities were found on a full-body CT scan or serum 
investigations for tumor markers. Therefore, surgery was performed on the 
lesion, within the cauda equina, for diagnosis as well as treatment.
RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the excised tumor indicated IPEH. The 
symptoms and quality of life improved postoperatively; there was no recurrence 
of the lesion.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of an IPEH intradural lesion within the 
cauda equina.
STUDY DESIGN: Case report.

Randomized, Controlled, Crossover Study of Self-administered Jacobson Relaxation 
in Chronic, Nonspecific, Low-back Pain.

Mateu M, Alda O, Inda MD, Margarit C, Ajo R, Morales D, van-der Hofstadt CJ, 
Peiró AM.

CONTEXT: Opioids decrease pain and improve functional capacity and quality of 
life; however, they are not always effective and are associated with harmful 
side effects. Few studies have shown that relaxation-based therapies, in 
comparison with usual care, can decrease pain.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate whether a controlled 
relaxation treatment, Jacobson progressive muscular relaxation (PMR), was 
effective in relieving chronic low-back pain (CLBP) and reducing pain 
comorbidities. The research team hypothesized that PMR-controlled relaxation 
could be more effective in reducing CLBP than music.
DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized, controlled, crossover study.
SETTING: The study took place in the pain unit, a clinic, in the Department of 
Health at Alicante-General Hospital (Alicante, Spain).
PARTICIPANTS: Participants in this study were 58 adults with nononcological 
CLBP, secondary to lumbar canal stenosis, who had been treated with opioids 
without any changes in the 3 mo prior to the study.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups, each of 
which received 2 treatments, but in a different order (ie, either AB or BA where 
A was the standardized PMR, the intervention, and B was relaxing music, the 
control. For both groups, the 2 treatment periods were 8 wk in length, with a 
1-mo washout period between them.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures included (1) a visual analogue 
scale-pain and relief intensity; (2) the 12-item short form health 
survey-quality of life; (3) the hospital anxiety and depression scale-anxiety 
and depression; and (4) the medical outcomes study sleep scale-sleep 
disturbances. Secondary outcome measures included a self-efficacy scale and a 
measure of satisfaction with treatment and compliance.
RESULTS: Pain was mostly mild to moderate. Greater decreases in pain between 
baseline and postintervention were observed for the PMR vs the control treatment 
in the mild pain category, with a VAS difference of 1.8 cm and P = .018. 
Significant differences were also found in anxiety, depression, quality of life, 
and sleep between participants in the 3 pain categories. Self-rated adherence 
was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the efficacy and acceptability of a self-guided 
PMR intervention for reducing CLBP with minimal time with a therapist.

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal study of spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a 
large-scale population-based study.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the order of appearance of degenerative change in 
vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs. We also sought to define the 
influence of endplate defect on low back pain (LBP) and to determine whether 
there is a genetic influence on endplate defect.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Endplate defect is a magnetic resonance imaging 
trait, found to be associated with intervertebral disc degeneration. There is a 
lack of understanding regarding the mechanism underlying lumbar disc 
degeneration (LDD). Recent attention has shifted to vertebral endplate defects 
and their role in spine degeneration pathology.
METHODS: Individuals from the TwinsUK spine study having longitudinal 
T2-weighted lumbar MR scans at baseline (n = 996) and a decade later (n = 438) 
were included. LDD, vertebral endplate defect by calculating a total endplate 
score, and Modic change (MC) were assessed using standard techniques. 
Mixed-effects models were used to determine the association between the features 
of spine pathology, adjusted for covariates. Endplate defect heritability was 
estimated using variance component analysis.
RESULTS: Significant association was found between endplate defect, LDD, MRI 
features of LDD and MC was observed. Endplate defect was associated with severe 
disabling LBP (P ≤ 0.013) in multivariate analysis. An association between disc 
degeneration (DD) at baseline and MC at follow-up was shown at upper lumbar 
levels. Total endplate score was heritable with estimated additive genetic 
component A = 55.3% (95% CI 43.0-65.4).
CONCLUSION: Endplate defect, LDD, and MC are all independent risk factors for 
episodes of severe and disabling LBP. Longitudinal analysis showed DD is 
followed by MC. Endplate defect has significant heritability of 55%. However, 
whether endplate defect triggers DD or these pathological changes occur 
concurrently could not be conclusively determined.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Local corticosteroids have been used to relieve symptoms of 
chronic low back pain, although treatment effects have been shown to wear off 
relatively fast. Prolonging corticosteroid presence by controlled release from 
biomaterials may allow for longer pain relief while circumventing adverse 
effects such as high bolus dosages.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
intradiscal controlled release of triamcinolone acetonide (TAA) by 
poly(esteramide) microspheres in a canine degenerated intervertebral disc (IVD) 
model.
STUDY DESIGN: In a preclinical experimental large animal model, the effect of 
prolonged glucocorticoid exposure on disc degeneration was evaluated.
METHODS: Degeneration was accelerated by nucleotomy of lumbar IVDs of Beagle 
dogs. After 4 weeks, microspheres loaded with 8.4 µg TAA, and 0.84mg TAA were 
administered to the degenerated IVDs by intradiscal injection (n=6 per group). 
Empty microspheres (n=6) and all adjacent non-nucleotomized noninjected IVDs 
were included as controls (n=24). Immediately prior to TAA administration and 
after 12 weeks, magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Degenerative changes 
were evaluated by disc height index, Pfirrmann grading, T1ρ and T2 mapping 
values, postmortem CT scans, macroscopic and microscopic grading, and 
biochemical/immunohistochemical analysis of inflammation and extracellular 
matrix content. In addition, nerve growth factor (NGF) protein expression, a 
biomarker for pain, was scored in nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues. The study was 
funded by a research grant from Health Holland (1.3million euros = 1.5million US 
dollars).
RESULTS: Macroscopic evaluation and CT images postmortem were consistent with 
mild disc degeneration. Other abnormalities were not observed. 
Nucleotomy-induced degeneration and inflammation was mild, reflected by moderate 
Pfirrmann grades and PGE2 levels. Regardless of TAA dosage, local sustained 
delivery did not affect disc height index nor Pfirrmann grading, T1ρ and T2 
mapping values, PGE2 tissue levels, collagen, GAG, and DNA content. However, the 
low dosage of TAA microspheres significantly reduced NGF immunopositivity in 
degenerated NP tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in vivo application in a preclinical large animal 
model of a controlled release formulation of corticosteroids in mild IVD 
degeneration. Sustained release of TAA locally in the IVD appeared safe and 
reduced NGF expression, suggesting its potential applicability for pain relief, 
although beneficial effects were absent on tissue degeneration.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present platform seems to be promising in extending 
the local controlled delivery of TAA with the potency to provide long-standing 
analgesia in the subset of LBP patients suffering from discogenic pain.

Type I AV fistulas of the spinal cord are exceedingly rare. The average age at 
diagnosis is 50. Clinical presentation is often very non-specific, and sensory 
deficits and sphincter dysfunction may also occur. Neurological deterioration is 
generally gradual. Thus, failure to diagnosis frequently results in permanent 
disability. A 22-year-old female complained of a "muscle spasm" in the midline 
thoracic area with no history of trauma or prior occurrence. She also 
experienced bilateral lower extremity weakness/numbness and perianal anesthesia. 
She is a healthy female with no medical problems. Exam revealed lower extremity 
motor function of 1/5 as well as diminished sensation. A foley catheter was 
placed for urinary retention. The remainder of the neurological exam was normal. 
MRI demonstrated a lesion at the fourth thoracic level with significant cord 
compression. The patient was taken emergently to the operating room by 
neurosurgery. This case demonstrates a rare disorder occurring in a 22-year old 
female, far younger than the typical 50-year old patient. Moreover, the lesion 
was located in the thoracic rather than the typical lumbar cord. Symptoms may be 
misinterpreted as a peripheral nerve lesion and delay time to diagnosis. Early 
diagnosis remains critical to prevent permanent neurologic sequelae. AV fistula 
should remain high on the differential of patients presenting with back pain and 
focal neurologic complaints.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine is commonly 
used to identify the source of low back pain (LBP); however, its use has been 
questionable. Throughout the years, numerous lumbar phenotypes (e.g., endplate 
abnormalities, Modic changes, black disc) have been studied as possible pain 
generators. High-intensity zones (HIZs) are of particular interest as they may 
represent annular tears. However, for over three decades, there has been heated 
debate as to whether these imaging biomarkers are synonymous with LBP. 
Therefore, the following study addressed a systematic review of the reported 
literature addressing the relationship of HIZs and LBP.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted via MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane, 
PubMed, PubMed Central, EMBASE via Ovid, and Web of Science with the following 
search terms: "HIZ," "high intensity zone," or "high intensity zones" and "low 
back pain," "pain," "lumbago," and/or "sciatica." Specific exclusion criteria 
were also maintained. Two independent reviewers searched the literature, 
selected the studies, and extracted the data.
RESULTS: We identified six studies from our search strategy that met the 
inclusion criteria from a total of 756 possible studies. One cross-sectional 
population-based study and five comparison studies were identified, which 
provided information regarding the prevalence of HIZs. The prevalence of HIZs 
was 3 to 61% in subjects with LBP and 2 to 3% in subjects without LBP. Only 
three studies suggested a significant association between the presence of HIZ 
and LBP with or without sciatica.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review has found evidence that HIZs may be a 
possible risk factor for LBP; however, a mismatch of the clinical relevance of 
HIZs between studies still remains. The available evidence is limited by small 
sample size, heterogeneous study populations, and lack of standardized imaging 
methods for phenotyping. HIZs may be important lumbar biomarkers that demand 
further investigation and should be considered in the global imaging assessment 
of the spine, which may have immense clinical utility. Further large-scale 
studies with standardized imaging and classification techniques as well as the 
assessment of patterns of HIZs are necessary to better understand their role 
with LBP development.

BACKGROUND: Besides CSF-flow obstruction, syringomyelia is associated with 
inflammatory spinal cord lesions. However, syringomyelia-like syndrome 
concomitant with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and primary 
Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is extremely rare. Here, we would like to report a case 
of a patient with syringomyelia-like syndrome in NMOSD complicated with 
Sjogren's Syndrome.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-old male Han Chinese, presented with three episodes of 
acute demyelinating processes in the central nervous system within 5 years. 
Firstly, he presented with ascending left lower extremity weakness and numbness, 
and initially progressive loss of vision in the right eye before 5 years, and 
subsequently in the right eye 2 months later. High dose corticosteroid therapy 
was prescribed for this attack. Second, he suffered from refractory 
gastrointestinal symptoms. such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and early 
satiety. After the second episode, he received long-term azathioprine and 
prednisone treatment in low dosages. Six months before admission, he developed 
the lower back pain and numbness in lower limbs, and urinary incontinence. This 
time, he complained of acute onset of right lower limb paralysis, paresthesia 
and urinary incontinence. MRI of the spine revealed a syringomyelia extending 
from the C7 to T4 levels with serum positive anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies 
(AQP4-Ab) (indirect immunofluorescence on AQP4 transfected cells). he was 
serologically positive for both anti-Sjögren's syndrome-related antigen A and B 
antibodies and there was reduced salivary flow on scintigraphy. Lip salivary 
gland (LSG) biopsies were graded (grade four lymphocytic infiltration) according 
to the Chisholm and Mason classification system and by morphometric analysis. 
And finally, diagnosed as syringomyelia-like syndrome in NMOSD complicated with 
Sjogren's syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Although extremely rare, This index patient highlights that 
syringomyelia could be associated with underlying NMOSD and pSS, and autoimmune 
disorders should be considered in the initial differential diagnosis, This is 
very helpful for the therapeutic implications and evaluating curative effect.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common musculoskeletal 
abnormalities. Epidural corticosteroid injections (ESIs) have been used long 
time ago for treatment of lumbar radiculopathy or discogenic back pain in case 
of failed medical and conservative management. Different techniques for ESIs 
include the interlaminar, the caudal, and the transforaminal approaches.
PURPOSE: The aim of our study is to compare between the efficacy of infraneural 
transforaminal ESI and lumbar paramedian nerve root targeted interlaminar 
steroid injection in reduction of unilateral radicular pain secondary to disc 
prolapse.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective double-blind randomized study was 
performed on 40 patients randomized into two equal groups, each of 20: the 
infraneural transforaminal ESI (IN group) and the interlaminar parasagittal ESI 
(IL group). Patients with backache without leg radiation, or with focal motor 
neurological deficit, previous spine surgery, S1 radiculopathy, lumbar ESI in 
the past month, systemic steroid used recently within 4 weeks before the 
procedure, allergy to any medication or addiction to opioids, and pregnancy were 
excluded from the study. The duration and efficacy of pain relief (defined as 
≥40% reduction of pain perception) by 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS) is the 
primary outcome. Functional assessment using Modified Oswestry Disability 
Questionnaire (MODQ) and possible side effects and complications are the 
secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The VAS and MODQ scores were significantly lower in both groups in 
comparison with the basal values. There was also a lower VAS in the infraneural 
group than the parasagittal (IL) group up to 6 months after injection.
CONCLUSION: The infraneural (IN) epidural steroid is more favorable than the 
parasagittal (IL) interlaminar epidural steroid owing to its long-term 
improvement in physical function than the parasagittal technique with no serious 
side effects.

Mechanical Low Back Pain.

Will JS(1), Bury DC(1), Miller JA(1).

Author information:
(1)Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA, USA.

Low back pain is usually nonspecific or mechanical. Mechanical low back pain 
arises intrinsically from the spine, intervertebral disks, or surrounding soft 
tissues. Clinical clues, or red flags, may help identify cases of nonmechanical 
low back pain and prompt further evaluation or imaging. Red flags include 
progressive motor or sensory loss, new urinary retention or overflow 
incontinence, history of cancer, recent invasive spinal procedure, and 
significant trauma relative to age. Imaging on initial presentation should be 
reserved for when there is suspicion for cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, 
fracture, or infection. Plain radiography of the lumbar spine is appropriate to 
assess for fracture and bony abnormality, whereas magnetic resonance imaging is 
better for identifying the source of neurologic or soft tissue abnormalities. 
There are multiple treatment modalities for mechanical low back pain, but strong 
evidence of benefit is often lacking. Moderate evidence supports the use of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and topiramate in the short-term 
treatment of mechanical low back pain. There is little or no evidence of benefit 
for acetaminophen, antidepressants (except duloxetine), skeletal muscle 
relaxants, lidocaine patches, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in 
the treatment of chronic low back pain. There is strong evidence for short-term 
effectiveness and moderate-quality evidence for long-term effectiveness of yoga 
in the treatment of chronic low back pain. Various spinal manipulative 
techniques (osteopathic manipulative treatment, spinal manipulative therapy) 
have shown mixed benefits in the acute and chronic setting. Physical therapy 
modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back 
pain and health care expenditures. Physical therapy modalities such as the 
McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and use of health 
care. Educating patients on prognosis and incorporating psychosocial components 
of care such as identifying comorbid psychological problems and barriers to 
treatment are essential components of long-term management.

Recent work utilizing ultrasound imaging demonstrated that individuals with low 
back pain (LBP) have increased thickness and decreased mobility of the 
thoracolumbar fascia (TLF), an indication that the TLF may play a role in LBP. 
This study used a porcine injury model (microsurgically induced local 
injury)-shown to produce similar results to those observed in humans with LBP-to 
test the hypothesis that TLF mechanical properties may also be altered in 
patients with LBP. Perimuscular TLF tissue was harvested from the noninjured 
side of vertebral level L3-4 in pigs randomized into either control (n = 5) or 
injured (n = 5) groups. All samples were tested with a displacement-controlled 
biaxial testing system using the following protocol: cyclic loading/unloading 
and stress relaxation tests at 25%, 35%, and then 45% of their resting length. 
Tissue anisotropy was also explored by comparing responses to loading in 
longitudinal and transverse orientations. Tissues from injured pigs were found 
to have greater stretch-stretch ratio moduli (measure of tissue stiffness), less 
energy dissipation, and less stress decay compared to tissues from control pigs. 
Responses across these variables also depended on loading orientation.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: these findings suggest that a focal TLF injury can 
produce impairments in tissue mechanical properties away from the injured area 
itself. This could contribute to some of the functional abnormalities observed 
in human LBP.

BACKGROUND: Breast hypertrophy, generally found in association with ptosis, is a 
common problem in postadolescent women. Beyond the psychological burden of 
excessively heavy, droopy breasts, physical symptoms compound the condition, 
with neck, shoulder and back pain. Reduction mammaplasty is one of the most 
common cosmetic operations, especially to improve patient's musculoskeletal 
symptoms, with proven benefits in patient satisfaction and self-esteem 
postoperatively. Multiple techniques exist for breast reduction, with no clear 
evidence of benefit of one over another.
METHODS: We review the senior author's experience in using a superolateral 
pedicle for breast reduction in 726 patients over the past 40 years. Over the 
past 10 years, the technique has also been adapted for simultaneous 
augmentation-mastopexy, especially in post-bariatric surgery patients. Benefits 
include recruitment of lateral breast tissue to fill the upper pole and correct 
axillary fullness. The technique has the advantages of ease of execution and a 
low complication rate.
RESULTS: Complete data were available for 397 patients. Resection weights varied 
from 380 to 1248 g, and mean sternal notch-nipple distance was 25.3 cm. Mean 
follow-up was 22 months. Complications were uncommon: four cases of partial 
nipple-areola complex loss, dehiscence in 14 patients, three hematomas and seven 
cases of superficial surgical site infection. Nipple sensitivity was decreased 
in eight patients, and three patients were unable to breastfeed following 
surgery. Revision surgery was requested by 14 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Breast reduction using the superolateral dermoglandular flap is 
easy to execute, versatile, safe and effective, preserving physiological 
functions, and is an excellent option when treating patients with 
medium-to-large breasts.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of intradiscal ozone injection in 
reducing pain and improving patients' performance in different types of 
intervertebral disc herniation based on Michigan State University (MSU) 
classification.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with low back pain and radiculopathy 
treated in our center with ozone chemonucleolysis from May 2017 through to 
January 2018 entered the study. Patients had a disc herniation classified as 
group 1-A, 2-A, 1-B, 2-B, 1-C, 2-C, 1-AB or 2-AB based on MSU classification in 
magnetic resonance imaging. In all patients entering the study the severity of 
pain was recorded according to the visual analog scale criteria before and one 
and three months after the end of treatment. Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability 
Index (ODI) was used to compare patients' performance before and after the 
treatment.
RESULTS: In total 128 patients (60 females and 68 males) with mean age of 
40.1 ± 10.7 entered the study. The patients were divided into eight groups based 
on MSU classification each including 16 patients. The reduction of pain severity 
and ODI score compared to baseline was statistically significant in all groups 
both in the first month and the third month after treatment. There was also a 
statistically significant difference between groups regarding the reduction of 
pain and ODI score indicating significantly worse treatment outcomes in groups 
1-C, 2-C and 2-AB.
CONCLUSION: Based on our findings it seems that MSU classification can be used 
in patients' selection to achieve the best treatment outcome after intradiscal 
ozone injection among patients with lumbar disc herniation.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are found in 1-12% of older males. 
Low back pain (LBP) is prevalent with incidence increasing with age and can 
respond to manual therapy (MT). To date, the safety of the application of MT for 
LBP in the presence of a known AAA has not been reported. This case reports on 
the short-term effects of MT in a patient with LBP and AAA and pre- and 
post-therapy imaging.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 76-year-old male presented with mechanical LBP, groin pain, 
and a known 4.2-cm AAA. A lumbar magnetic resonance imaging showed significant 
multilevel abnormalities. Abdominal screening did not elicit back or groin pain. 
Lumbar and hip range of motion and accessory motion testing reproduced his 
complaints. He was treated with lumbar and hip MT.
OUTCOMES: After three visits, he reported that his groin pain resolved, and his 
back pain could be managed with home exercise. He reported a +6 on the global 
rating of change. Repeated follow-up imaging of his AAA demonstrated no 
significant change of his AAA.
DISCUSSION: No immediate adverse events were recorded, and repeated follow-up 
imaging indicated no significant AAA expansion. Considering that mobilization 
causes similar displacement to active motion, research into the safety of MT in 
this population is warranted as are guidelines for appropriate initial and 
ongoing clinical screening during treatment in this population.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain is responsible for significant personal and societal 
burden, particularly when it becomes persistent. Despite international consensus 
regarding the judicious use of diagnostic spinal imaging, patients continue to 
be over-referred.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to highlight the critical need for primary 
care clinicians to engage in thoughtful use of imaging procedures, and to 
consider alternative or adjunct methods for providing reassurance, in order to 
avoid or mitigate the potential negative impact of 'anomalous' findings.
DISCUSSION: While imaging is frequently requested with the goal of reassuring 
patients, it can paradoxically have a negative impact on patient attitudes and 
beliefs and can influence pain behaviours. For improved patient outcomes we 
recommend contextualisation of radiological findings within age-related norms, 
use of reassuring and non‑threatening language when communicating results, and 
educating patients on non‑pathoanatomical contributors to pain.

INTRODUCTION: Elsberg syndrome (ES) is a rarely recognized cause of cauda equina 
syndrome and lower thoracic myelitis, mainly linked to reactivation, or 
occasionally primary, infection with herpes simplex virus type 2. West Nile 
virus neuroinvasive disease is rarely considered in the differential diagnosis 
of patients with ES.
CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old man with pancreatic cancer in remission and 
polymyalgia rheumatica on low-dose prednisone presented with a 10-day history of 
low-back pain and a viral-type illness with low-grade fever, nausea, and 
vomiting. Days later, he developed left leg monoparesis, neurogenic bladder, and 
bowel. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine revealed a hyperintense 
signal abnormality within the central spinal cord and conus medullaris with mild 
swelling of the conus. Cells, proteins, and glucose in cerebrospinal fluid were 
67/mm, 70 mg/dL, and 58 mg/dL, respectively. Serology was positive for West Nile 
virus IgM. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography showed an acute motor 
neurogenic process affecting left lumbosacral segments.
CONCLUSIONS: West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease is an uncommon condition that 
should be considered in patients with ES. Determining the etiology of ES in the 
acute setting may avoid unnecessary diagnostic investigations and treatments.

The purpose of this report is to describe the evaluation and treatment of a 
patient with neck pain and ankylosing spondylitis who had underlying 
atlantoaxial instability. The patient was a 31-yr-old man diagnosed with 
ankylosing spondylitis 1 yr prior who was referred to a physical therapist for 
the treatment of chronic, worsening low back and hip pain. He also had secondary 
complaints of neck, upper back, and shoulder pain. The patient worked as a 
military pilot. As part of the patient's physical examination, a Sharp-Purser 
test was performed, which was positive for excessive motion. Diagnostic imaging 
confirmed the atlantoaxial instability; it was also determined that the 
patient's atlanto-occipital joints were fused. Despite evidence of atlantoaxial 
instability, it was determined the patient would be managed through nonsurgical 
interventions. The patient was prescribed etanercept by his rheumatologist and 
the physical therapist developed a comprehensive rehabilitation program that 
addressed relevant impairments of the spine, hips, and shoulders. At 3 yr 
following his initial evaluation with the physical therapist, the patient 
continued to report minimal bodily pain and no limitations in his functional 
capabilities. Additionally, the patient had earned a high profile flying 
position with an aggressive flying schedule and he successfully completed his 
first running marathon. It is important for clinicians to have an understanding 
of the clinical findings associated with atlantoaxial instability, as these 
findings provide guidance for diagnostic imaging and specialist referral prior 
to initiating conservative management strategies, such as physical therapy.

Lower back pain (LBP) is one of the most common chief complaints encountered in 
primary care. Advanced imaging studies, including computerized tomography (CT) 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are frequently ordered in the setting of 
LBP. Structural abnormalities are commonly identified by CT and MRI in patients 
complaining of low back pain, however, these findings are also found in 
asymptomatic patients. In the past decade, multiple guidelines have been 
published to help providers identify patients in whom the use of advanced 
imaging is appropriate. In this article, we review common conditions associated 
with LBP that require advanced imaging along with their clinical and associated 
imaging findings.

Left-sided inferior vena cava (IVC) is a rare malformation of IVC. We report an 
11-year-old boy with hematuria and left lower back pain due to compression of 
the left-sided IVC between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. 
Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging clearly revealed this anatomic 
anomaly.

This study examined characteristics of trunk muscles electrical activity in 
young adults performed in the course of static and dynamic trunk muscles 
strengthening exercises using different lumbar spine stabilization manoeuvres. 
Twenty young adults (Mage = 25.5 SD = 2.91) participated in this study. Of the 
20, 11 subjects (5 males and 6 females) reported no history of pain, 9 subjects 
(5 males and 4 females) reported lower back pain (LBP) within the last three 
months. Subjects performed lumbar spine stabilization manoeuvres (abdominal 
bracing (AB) and abdominal hollowing (AH)) with static and dynamic abdominal 
muscles strengthening exercises (i.e., plank, side-bridges, and curl-ups). 
Noraxon Telemyo twelve channel electromyography device (Noraxon USA, Inc.) was 
used to record EMG data from rectus abdominal muscle (RA), external oblique 
muscles (EO), internal oblique muscles (IO), and erector spine muscles (ES). In 
static exercises such as side-bridge exercise, significantly higher RA muscle 
electrical activity was recorded with AB manoeuvre compared to AH manoeuvre both 
on the right side and left side respectively (Z = -2.17; p = 0.03; Z = 3.40; p = 
0.001). In dynamic exercises such as curl-up exercise, during the lifting phase, 
median value of RA muscle activity with AB was significantly higher than with AH 
(Z = -2.315; p = 0.021). Median value of IO muscles activity with AH was 
significantly higher than with AB (Z = -3.230; p = 0.001). Our findings 
indicated that although surface muscles are more activated with AB manoeuvre 
exercises, deep abdominal muscles are more activated in exercises with AH 
manoeuvre. These findings can help practitioners design interventions to 
integrate AH manoeuvre for benefiting persons with lumbar instability.

Degenerated discs have shorter T2-relaxation time and lower MR signal. The 
location of the signal-intensity-weighted-centroid reflects the water 
distribution within a region-of-interest (ROI). This study compared the 
reliability of the location of the signal-intensity-weighted-centroid to mean 
signal intensity and area measurements. L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs were measured on 
43 mid-sagittal T2-weighted 3T MRI images in adults with back pain. One rater 
analysed images twice and another once, blinded to measurements. Discs were 
semi-automatically segmented into a whole disc, nucleus, anterior and posterior 
annulus. The coordinates of the signal-intensity-weighted-centroid for all 
regions demonstrated excellent intraclass-correlation-coefficients for intra- 
(0.99-1.00) and inter-rater reliability (0.97-1.00). The standard error of 
measurement for the Y-coordinates of the signal-intensity-weighted-centroid for 
all ROIs were 0 at both levels and 0 to 2.7 mm for X-coordinates. The mean 
signal intensity and area for the whole disc and nucleus presented excellent 
intra-rater reliability with intraclass-correlation-coefficients from 0.93 to 
1.00, and 0.92 to 1.00 for inter-rater reliability. The mean signal intensity 
and area had lower reliability for annulus ROIs, with intra-rater 
intraclass-correlation-coefficient from 0.5 to 0.76 and inter-rater from 0.33 to 
0.58. The location of the signal-intensity-weighted-centroid is a reliable 
biomarker for investigating the effects of disc interventions.

BACKGROUND: While the majority of adult-onset minimal change nephrotic syndrome 
(MCNS) is a primary or an idiopathic form of disease, it can also occur as a 
secondary form. Reports on the spontaneous remission of MCNS are rare since the 
condition is typically treated with corticosteroids. We herein describe the 
spontaneous remission of adult-onset MCNS in a patient who developed nephrotic 
syndrome after type B influenza infection.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old woman experienced fever, cough, malaise, and 
low back pain, which had persisted for 6 days before she presented to our 
hospital, and edema of the face and limbs, which had persisted for 5 days before 
her presentation. She was diagnosed with type B influenza infection and later 
exhibited an exacerbation of facial edema, decreased urine output, and a high 
level of proteinuria. She was referred to our department after the diagnosis of 
nephrotic syndrome. On admission, her proteinuria level was 20.88 g/gCr and her 
selectivity index value was 0.13. The examination of a kidney biopsy specimen 
obtained on the fourth day of hospitalization under a light microscope revealed 
minor abnormalities. An immunofluorescence showed only nonspecific granular IgM 
deposits in the mesangium. Electron microscopy showed extensive foot process 
effacement without any immune complex deposits. Based on these findings, the 
patient was diagnosed with MCNS. After admission, the proteinuria decreased to 
0.06 g/gCr with rest and sodium restriction (6 g/day) alone; a complete 
remission from nephrotic syndrome was observed at approximately 2 weeks after 
the onset of symptoms. There have been no signs of recurrence of nephrotic 
syndrome in the one years since.
CONCLUSION: We experienced a rare case in which spontaneous remission of MCNS 
occurred within a short period of 2 weeks after influenza B infection. When 
patients present with nephrotic syndrome after an infection, it is necessary to 
consider MCNS in the differential diagnosis, which also includes post-infectious 
glomerulonephritis and the acute exacerbation of IgA nephropathy.

Back pain is a worldwide health problem, adding a tremendous burden to modern 
societies. However, little information on back health is available in China, 
even though a quarter of the world's population is Chinese. To enhance knowledge 
in this area, we designed and initiated the Hangzhou Lumbar Spine Study, which 
is a cross-sectional study of a general sample of mainland Chinese with focusing 
on disc degeneration, Modic changes, endplate lesions, and back pain. The study 
consists of a structured questionnaire to measure back pain history and lifetime 
exposure to suspected risk factors, magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar 
spine, bone mineral density study of the spine and hip, and DNA sample analysis. 
Here we briefly introduce the study methodology, report the test-retest 
reliability of the questionnaire, and describe the cohort profile to date. Since 
May 2014, 301 randomly selected subjects (male/female, 122/179; mean age, 51.0 
years; range, 20-87 years) have been recruited. Tests-retests of the 
questionnaire, completed by 40 participants, revealed good reliability. To our 
knowledge, the Hangzhou Lumbar Spine Study is the first population-based 
epidemiological study conducted to characterize lumbar spinal phenotypes and 
back pain, their interaction, and their associations with lifetime environmental 
exposure, in mainland Chinese. Epidemiological information obtained from a 
reliable questionnaire, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data, dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) measurements, and DNA analysis may serve as a valuable 
reference for future studies on back health, particularly for mainland Chinese.

Segmental Spinal Myoclonus Complicating Lumbar Transforaminal Epidural Steroid 
Injection.

Wong SSC(1), Qiu Q, Cheung CW.

Author information:
(1)From the Laboratory and Clinical Research Institute for Pain, Department of 
Anaesthesiology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

OBJECTIVE: Lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection is commonly used for 
treating lumbar radicular pain. We report a case of segmental spinal myoclonus 
that developed during lumbar transforaminal epidural injection with local 
anesthetic and steroid.
CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old woman with failed back surgery syndrome presented 
with low back and right L3 and L4 radicular pain. As she had responded well 
previously to diagnostic selective nerve root injection with local anesthetic at 
the right L3 and L4 levels, lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection at 
the same levels was scheduled. During injection of ropivacaine and triamcinolone 
at the right L3-4 intervertebral foramen, she complained of back pain and 
immediately developed involuntary contraction of her right hip. The procedure 
was terminated. No new neurological deficit was detected when she was examined 
15 minutes after the procedure. There were no abnormalities from blood tests and 
magnetic resonance imaging of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. A neurologist 
subsequently made the clinical diagnosis of segmental spinal myoclonus. The 
myoclonus improved over 1 month and eventually resolved completely.
CONCLUSIONS: Segmental spinal myoclonus is a rare complication after lumbar 
transforaminal epidural steroid and local anesthetic injection. Pain physicians 
should be aware of this potential complication.

[Precise application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in minimally-invasive 
techniques].

China; fuhuidong@263.net.

The miminally-invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) uses 
different types of acupuncture needles to treat diseased locations with special 
techniques. These techniques include different methods of insertion and closed 
incision (press cutting, sliding cutting, scrape cutting, etc.). This needling 
technique is based on the traditional Chinese medicine theories of Pi 
Bu(cutaneous), Jing Jin(sinew), Jing Luo(meridian), Wu Ti(five body structure 
components) and Zang Fu(organ system). Commonly used needles include: needle 
Dao, needle with edge, Pi needle, Shui needle, Ren needle, Gou needle, Chang 
Yuan needle, Bo needle and so on. The principle of this minimally-invasive 
technique of TCM is to achieve the greatest healing benefit with the least 
amount of anatomical and physiological intervention. This will result in the 
highest standard of health care with the lowest rehabilitative need and burden 
of care. In the past 20 years, through the collaborative research of several 
hundred hospitals across China, we systemically reviewed the best minimally 
invasive technique of TCM and the first line treatments for selective 
conditions. In 2013, the Department of Medical Affairs of the State 
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine created "Traditional Chinese 
Medicine Technical Manual"(General Version) and released it nationwide, its 
contents include: (1)Minimally invasive scar tissue release. ¹Suitable for Bi 
and pain syndromes of neck, shoulder, waist, buttocks and extremities. 
²Degeneration causes local hypertrophy and inflammation, creating local tissue 
adhesion. ³There are two kind incision methods-press cutting and slide cutting. 
(2)Minimally invasive fascial tension release. ¹Suitable for localized fascial 
tension caused by trauma, overuse, or wind-cold-dampness, leading to 
compensatory hyperplasia. ²Long term high-stress stimulation to local fascia 
creates compensatory hyperplasia, Ashi points, and tissue texture changes 
(cords, nodules, masses). ³According to the different structural features of the 
needles, there are two incision methods: penetrating from the outside to the 
inside and pulling from inside to outside. (3)Minimally invasive decompression 
technique. ¹Suitable for internal pressure changes within organ cavities caused 
by trauma, degeneration, inflammation, such as compartment syndrome, bone marrow 
edema, increased intraluminal pressure in the bone marrow. ²According to the 
different tissues, it is categorized into soft tissue decompression, and bone 
decompression. (4)Minimally invasive orthopedic surgery. Applicable to some 
postural, developmental deformity correction, mainly through the dynamic balance 
method and/or static balance method. (5)Minimally invasive dissection. Suitable 
for fractures, tendons injury caused by deep soft tissue adhesion. (6)Minimally 
invasive separation. ¹Suitable for cutaneous, sinew regions, superficial 
adhesions due to lesions, and local post-operative incision adhesions. 
²According to the structure of the needle tip, the methods are divided into 
sharp separation and blunt dissection. (7)Minimally invasive sustained pressure 
technique. ¹Suitable for neuromuscular dysfunction which causes JING(spasm) 
syndrome and WEI(atrophy) syndrome. ²The needle is applied with sustained 
pressure, without penetrating select tissue surface. This includes: nerve root 
sustained pressure technique; peripheral nerve sustained pressure technique; 
muscle sustained pressure technique; fascial contact procedure; cutaneous 
sustained pressure technique.(8)Minimally invasive insertion technique. 
¹Suitable for systemic regulation to treat disease. ²Different organs are 
connected to different layers of tissue. Therefore, to treat specific 
conditions, specific tissues must be targeted. ³For example, back Shu points are 
used to treat vertigo from cervical spine issues, and spinal degeneration 
associated digestion issue. ⁴The internal organs can be regulated by the 
pathways that runs along the different layers of tissue. The types of 
stimulation include: meridian acupoint stimulation; cutaneous stimulation; 
fascia stimulation; mucle stimulation; periosteum stimulation. The clinical 
application of these techniques has enriched the drug-free therapies of 
traditional Chinese medicine and achieved excellent outcomes, but at the same 
time it also raises an important question. How can we apply these minimally 
invasive techniques to clinical practice so it can be safe and effective? In 
addition, how can practitioners, individually and further develop their 
understanding of this minimally invasive technique progressive manner? We make 
the following recommendations. (1)Clear diagnosis and precise application. Any 
approach has specific indications and choosing the correct technique comes from 
a comprehensive understanding of its advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the 
accurate application of the technique depends the expertise of the practitioner. 
Through systematic review and clinical observation, we formulated the First Line 
Treatment, the Second Line Treatment, and the Third Line Treatment for specific 
conditions. Using the information gathered from research, practitioners can 
decide on which point is appropriate to use based on the stage of disease 
progression. For example, common conditions like the nerve ending tension 
pain(i.e. cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome) is caused by stress 
concentration. There are two types of treatment for this condition: ¹Change in 
the response to stress state (i.e.non-invasive approach such as manual therapy 
and physiotherapy). ²Change in state of surrounding environment (i.e. invasive 
approach such as Pi Needle). Before tissue texture changes to pain point, cord, 
nodules, the former approach is effective. Once tissue texture changes, the 
latter approach is First Line Treatment. (2)Systematic training and disease 
progression training. The minimally invasive techniques of traditional Chinese 
medicine can treat many kinds of disease. To ensure its safety, organization, 
progressive development, practitioners are trained systematically and manage 
their treatment approach through disease hierarchy. Moreover, this technique 
should be conducted according to its technical difficulty, operating conditions, 
and expertise of the practitioner. The application of minimally invasive 
techniques of traditional Chinese medicine does not depend on the hospitals' 
administration system or the regulatory college of medical professionals. The 
minimally invasive techniques of TCM should be taught from easy to difficult, 
simple to complicated, and requires gradual progression by the practitioners. 
Eventually, the minimally invasive techniques of TCM's diagnostic and treatment 
protocol can be created. These protocols are currently available for reference: 
¹Forming diagnosis and differential diagnosis for the conditions below requires 
expert diagnostic and application skills: cerebral palsy; cervical vertigo; 
cervical headache; cervical precordial pain; other spine-related diseases. ²The 
requirements for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such techniques are 
relatively high, and special training is required for the practitioner who 
performs this technique. The conditions below uses minimally invasive orthopedic 
surgery and dissection: scar contracture deformity; congenital developmental 
malformations; cervical Bi-syndrome; shoulder pain syndrome; knee Bi-syndrome; 
low back pain; cervical spondylosis; lumbar disc herniation; avascular necrosis 
of the femoral head; ankylosing spondylitis. ³There are no special requirements 
for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such techniques, and special 
training is required for the practitioner who performs this technique. The 
technical content is mainly decompression and scar tissue release. a)Muscle 
strain diseases: levator scapulae, splenius capitis, splenius cervicis, 
supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, teres major, serratus posterior 
superior, serratus posterior inferior, piriformis, gluteus maximus, gluteus 
medius, and gluteus minimus, erector spinae. b)Joint degenerative disorders: 
frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, tenosynovitis, knee osteoarthritis, and plantar 
fascitis. c)JING-JIN PI-BU pain syndrome (cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome): 
occipital great nerve entrapment syndrome, occipital small nerve entrapment 
syndrome, great auricular nerve entrapment syndrome, suprascapular nerve 
entrapment syndrome, transverse cutaneous nerve of neck entrapment syndrome. 
(3)People-centred practice. The most attractive feature of the minimally 
invasive techniques of TCM is that they do not rely on expensive medical 
equipment and operating conditions. The key to applying this technique is the 
practitioners' technique, skill, and expertise. The necessary conditions 
required to successfully apply this technique is ¹practitioner understands 
disease progression and diagnosis; ²practitioners' skill in applying technique. 
We require patient-centered approach, which uses evidence based approach as the 
focus. We aim to seek the truth from facts, to understand the comprehensive 
picture, to include pertinent details, to be observant, to be goal oriented, 
from one to another, from outside to inside, from top to the bottom, compare 
right from left, through active movement and passive movements and 
weight-bearing movements, and assisted passive movements to determine 
instantaneous centre to diagnose stress concentration points. The operating 
technique is based on the response of patient's tissues to this technique. We 
must pay attention to diagnosis through palpation: layers, structure, texture, 
deformity, dislocation, movement characteristic, rhythmic changes. To achieve 
SHOU MO XIN HUI WU WEI: position, quantify, quantity, timing, and pattern. 
Accurate grasp of timeliness and dose efficiency. Can distinguish between local 
or systemic effects of treatment. Through comprehensive judgment of hands 
feeling, acupuncture needle feeling, and inspiration, to achieve the precious 
treatment requirements as indicated by the "Huangdi Neijing·Suwen": "Puncture 
the bone without damaging tendons, and puncture tendons without damaging 
muscles, puncture the muscle without damaging pulse, puncture pulse without 
damaging skin, puncture skin without damaging muscle. Puncture muscle without 
damage tendons, puncture tendons without damaging bone... Puncture bone without 
damaging tendons and it means the needle passes through the tendons and arrives 
at the bone and work on the bone. Puncture tendons without damaging muscles, and 
it means the needle passes through the muscles and arrives close to the tendon. 
Puncture the muscle without damaging pulse and it means the needle passes the 
pulse and does not touch the muscle. Puncture pulse without damaging skin and it 
means, the needle passes through the skin without penetrating pulse. Puncture 
skin without damaging muscle and it means, the disease is in the skin and the 
needles insert into skin but does not damage muscle. Puncture muscle without 
damage tendons, and it means, the needle passes through the muscle and arrive on 
the tendon. Puncture tendons without damaging bone."

BACKGROUND Paradoxical reactions to tuberculosis (TB) are clinical or 
radiological worsening of prior tuberculous lesions or the development of new 
lesions upon treatment with appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). This 
phenomenon has been described in both HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative 
patients. Although historically estimated to occur in 6-30% of HIV-seronegative 
patients with TB, the phenomenon is often under-recognized in the current era, 
particularly in countries of low TB prevalence. We describe a case of a TB 
paradoxical reaction affecting the CNS and spine in an HIV-seronegative 
individual who received clinical care in the U.S. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old 
HIV-seronegative refugee from Eritrea presented to the hospital with fever, back 
pain, and headache shortly after arriving to the U.S. He was diagnosed with TB 
meningitis and Pott's disease and was started on ATT. He developed worsening 
clinical symptoms, including headaches, transient diplopia, and mood 
disturbances, as well as new radiologic abnormalities in the brain 
(tuberculomas) and spine (abnormal enhancement) despite appropriate ATT. He 
received prolonged 4-drug ATT and steroids as well as changes in his ATT 
regimen, and multiple attempts were made to biopsy the brain and spine to 
address concerns for radiologic changes. Eventually, he was discharged 1 year 
later with clinical improvement and full neurologic recovery. CONCLUSIONS 
Radiologic and clinical findings due to paradoxical reactions may be unfamiliar 
to clinicians in countries with low TB prevalence and inadvertently lead to 
either inadequate management such as the underappreciation of the clinical signs 
and symptoms indicating potential severity of CNS paradoxical reaction, or 
conversely overly invasive approaches in a patient who is otherwise clinically 
improving. Increasing awareness about extrapulmonary paradoxical reactions in 
such patients is crucial for ensuring appropriate diagnostic approaches and 
timely clinical management.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common and costly condition. Spinal manipulative 
therapy (SMT) is a treatment supported in some guidelines, although most 
clinical trials examining SMT report small effect sizes. Enhancing the effects 
of SMT requires an understanding of underlying mechanisms and a systematic 
approach to leverage understanding of mechanisms to create more effective 
treatment protocols that are scalable in clinical practice. Prior work has 
identified effects on spinal stiffness and lumbar multifidus activation as 
possible mechanisms. This project represents a refinement phase study within the 
context of a multi-phase optimization strategy (MOST) framework. Our goal is to 
identify an optimized SMT treatment protocol by examining the impact of using 
co-intervention exercise strategies that are proposed to accentuate SMT 
mechanisms. The optimized protocol can then be evaluated in confirmation phase 
clinical trials and implementation studies.
METHODS: A phased, factorial randomized trial design will be used to evaluate 
the effects of three intervention components provided in eight combinations on 
mechanistic (spinal stiffness and multifidus muscle activation) and 
patient-reported outcomes (pain and disability). All participants will receive 
two sessions then will be randomly assigned to receive six additional sessions 
(or no additional treatment) over the next three weeks with factorial 
combinations of additional SMT and exercise co-interventions (spine mobilizing 
and multifidus activating). Outcome assessments occur at baseline, and one week, 
four weeks, and three months after enrollment. Pre-specified analyses will 
evaluate main effects for treatment components as well as interaction effects.
DISCUSSION: Building on preliminary findings identifying possible mechanisms of 
effects for SMT, this trial represents the next phase in a multiphase strategy 
towards the ultimate goal of developing an optimized protocol for providing SMT 
to patients with LBP. If successful, the results of this trial can be tested in 
future clinical trials in an effort to produce larger treatment benefits and 
improve patient-centered outcomes for individuals with LBP.

Lumbosacral Transitional Vertebra-Related Low Back Pain: Resolving the 
Controversy.

Gopalan B(1), Yerramshetty JS(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedics, Chettinad Hospital and Research Institute, 
Kancheepuram, India.

STUDY DESIGN: Case control study.
PURPOSE: The association of lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) with low 
back pain (LBP) is controversial, as is the role of occupational physical 
activity and radiological spinal abnormalities suggestive of other spinal 
disorders (OSDs) such as spinal degeneration and instability. This study aimed 
to determine if any association of LSTV with LBP exists. If so, the association 
of the level of physical activity and presence of OSD with LSTV-related LBP was 
determined.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The cause of LBP has been linked to proximal level disc 
degeneration, arthritic pseudoarticulation between LSTV and the sacral ala, 
facet joint degeneration, and nerve root compression due to a broadened 
transverse process. LSTV associated with LBP is present among individuals who 
are involved in high-level physical activity, including military recruits and 
athletes.
METHODS: This was an unmatched study comprising 372 cases and 224 controls 
consecutively recruited with clinical and radiographic documentation. The 
relationship between LSTV and LBP was analyzed, and the effects of LSTV and OSD 
on this relationship were also assessed and statistically controlled.
RESULTS: The presence of LSTV (p =0.039) was significantly associated with LBP, 
and the presence of OSD was associated with LTSV-related LBP, after 
statistically controlling for the level of physical activity (p =0.024). The 
level of physical activity was not associated with LBP. Demographic analysis 
revealed female predominance with an advanced age (>45 years) among those with 
LSTV-related LBP who have OSD.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of LSTV was associated with an increased prevalence of 
LBP. This association was probably due to the confounding effect of OSD. The 
level of occupational physical activity was not associated with LSTV-related 
LBP. We speculate that advanced age and female sex caused the spurious 
association of LSTV with LBP in our study, rendering LSTV-related LBP 
controversial in published literature.

A 38-year-old woman was suffering from back, right arm, and ankle joint pain, 
and visited our emergency department. Upon admission, the white blood cell (WBC) 
count was high (11,700/µL), and low numbers of red blood cells (2.21 × 106/µL) 
and platelets (PLTs) (42,000/µL) were observed. A PLT histogram showed an 
abnormally shaped peak at around 20-30 fL, suggesting the presence of giant PLTs 
or PLT aggregation. The WBC histogram showed abnormal elevation at 35 fL and 
around 100 fL, suggesting abnormal cells including nucleated red blood cells. A 
peripheral blood smear was prepared, and morphology was examined. As a result, 
blasts (4%) including many orthochromatic erythroblasts (48/100 WBCs) were 
observed. Acute leukemia was suspected, and the patient was transferred the next 
day to a hospital with a hematology department. Bone marrow aspiration revealed 
that 99% of cells were blasts positive for B lymphoid lineage markers and 
myeloperoxidase. The patient was diagnosed with mixed phenotype lineage acute 
leukemia, treated immediately, and achieved remission. Thus, careful observation 
of histogram abnormalities of an automatic blood cell analyzer is important for 
rapid diagnosis of acute leukemia.

University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a practical approach for the diagnosis and treatment of 
thoracic zygapophyseal joint pain and to present preliminary clinical data on 
the effects of this treatment approach on health-related quality of life.
DESIGN: An observational study.
SETTING: Specialist outpatient pain clinic in northern Sweden.
SUBJECTS: Patients with long-term thoracic pain.
METHODS: We describe a method of radiofrequency denervation of thoracic 
zygapophyseal joints. We compared health-related quality of life between 
patients who underwent radiofrequency denervation of thoracic zygapophyseal 
joints and patients who underwent radiofrequency denervation for lumbar and 
cervical zygapophyseal joint pain.
RESULTS: Treatment according to the Spine Intervention Society Guidelines was 
performed on the lumbar region in 178 patients and in the cervical region in 55 
patients. Another 82 patients were treated in the thoracic region with our 
proposed technique. A survival plot of improvements in health-related quality of 
life revealed that all three treatments were effective in 65% or more of 
patients. The improvement in health-related quality of life was maintained for 
12 or more months after treatment in 47% to 51% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that radiofrequency denervation of thoracic 
zygapophyseal joint pain is as effective as radiofrequency denervation, the 
standard treatment, for lumbar and cervical zygapophyseal joint pain. If these 
results can be confirmed by other centers, radiofrequency denervation is likely 
to become more widely available for the treatment of thoracic zygapophyseal 
joint pain.

Surface electromyography (sEMG) studies have indicated that chronic low back 
pain (cLBP) involves altered electromyographic activity and morphological 
structure of the lumbar multifidus (LM) beyond pain perception; however, most 
studies have evaluated the superficial lumbar multifidus. It is difficult to 
record electromyography (EMG) signals from the deep multifidus (DM) to determine 
the neuromuscular activation patterns, making it difficult to determine the 
relationship between functional and structural changes in cLBP. We developed a 
novel method to record intramuscular EMG signals in the DM based on the sEMG 
system and fine-wire electrodes. We measured EMG signals of the DM in 24 cLBP 
patients and 26 pain-free healthy controls to identify changes in neuromuscular 
activation. We also used ultrasound to measure DM muscle thickness, 
cross-sectional area, and contraction activity to identify potential 
relationships between EMG activity and structural damage. cLBP patients had 
decreased average EMG and root mean square, but increased median frequency and 
mean power frequency. Average EMG was positively correlated with contractile 
activity, but not statistically correlated with noncontractile anatomical 
abnormalities. Our results suggest that cLBP alters the neuromuscular activation 
patterns and morphological structure of the contractile activity of the DM, 
providing insights into the mechanisms underlying pain perception.

Diagnosing the causes of low back pain is a challenging task, prone to errors. A 
novel approach to increase diagnostic accuracy in medical decision making is 
collective intelligence, which refers to the ability of groups to outperform 
individual decision makers in solving problems. We investigated whether 
combining the independent ratings of chiropractors, chiropractic radiologists 
and medical radiologists can improve diagnostic accuracy when interpreting 
diagnostic images of the lumbosacral spine. Evaluations were obtained from two 
previously published studies: study 1 consisted of 13 raters independently 
rating 300 lumbosacral radiographs; study 2 consisted of 14 raters independently 
rating 100 lumbosacral magnetic resonance images. In both studies, raters 
evaluated the presence of "abnormalities", which are indicators of a serious 
health risk and warrant immediate further examination. We combined independent 
decisions of raters using a majority rule which takes as final diagnosis the 
decision of the majority of the group. We compared the performance of the 
majority rule to the performance of single raters. Our results show that with 
increasing group size (i.e., increasing the number of independent decisions) 
both sensitivity and specificity increased in both data-sets, with groups 
consistently outperforming single raters. These results were found for 
radiographs and MR image reading alike. Our findings suggest that combining 
independent ratings can improve the accuracy of lumbosacral diagnostic image 
reading.

University, Chiba, Japan.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
PURPOSE: We examined change in lumbrosacral spine alignment and low back pain 
(LBP) following total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with severe hip 
osteoarthritis (OA).
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Severe hip osteoarthritis has been reported to cause 
spine alignment abnormalities and low back pain, and it has been reported that 
low back pain is improved following THA.
METHODS: Our target population included 30 patients (29 female, mean age 63.5 
years) with hip OA who underwent direct anterior approach THA. There were 12 
cases with bilateral hip disease and 18 cases with unilateral osteoarthritis. 
Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for LBP and coxalgia, the Roland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back 
Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) were assessed before and after surgery. 
Spinal alignment metrics were measured before and after surgery.
RESULTS: VAS for LBP change from preoperative to final postoperative observation 
was significantly improved (p <0.05), as was VAS for hip pain (p<0.001). RDQ 
improved significantly (p<0.01). All five domains of JOABPEQ were significantly 
improved (p<0.05). In terms of coronal alignment, lumbar scoliosis change from 
preoperative to last observation was significantly reduced (p<0.05). There were 
no significant changes in the sagittal alignment metrics. In addition, there was 
a correlation between before and after RDQ difference and before and after 
lumbar scoliosis difference (p<0.05). VAS for LBP (p<0.05) as well as RDQ 
(p<0.05) were significantly improved only in unilateral OA. Lumbar scoliosis was 
significantly improved in cases of unilateral OA (p<0.05), but alignment did not 
improve in cases of bilateral OA (p=0.29).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates improvements in VAS for LBP, RDQ, 
and all domains of JOABPEQ. There were also significant reductions in lumbar 
scoliosis and an observed correlation of RDQ improvement with lumbar scoliosis 
improvement. We were able to observe improvements in lumbar scoliosis and low 
back pain only in cases of unilateral OA. It has been suggested that the

OBJECTIVE: Correlation between radiologic structural abnormalities and clinical 
symptoms in low back pain patients is poor. There is an unmet clinical need to 
image inflammation in pain conditions to aid diagnosis and guide treatment. 
Ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticle, is 
clinically used to treat iron deficiency anemia and showed promise in imaging 
tissue inflammation in human. We explored whether ferumoxytol can be used to 
identify tissue and nerve inflammation in pain conditions in animals and humans.
METHODS: Complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA) or saline was injected into mice hind 
paws to establish an inflammatory pain model. Ferumoxytol (20 mg/kg) was 
injected intravenously. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to 
injection and 72 hours postinjection. The changes in the transverse relaxation 
time (T2) before and after ferumoxytol injection were compared between mice that 
received CFA vs saline injection. In the human study, we administered 
ferumoxytol (4 mg/kg) to a human subject with clinical symptoms of lumbar 
radiculopathy and compared the patient with a healthy subject.
RESULTS: Mice that received CFA exhibited tissue inflammation and pain 
behaviors. The changes in T2 before and after ferumoxytol injection were 
significantly higher in mice that received CFA vs saline (20.8 ± 3.6 vs 
2.2 ± 2.5, P = 0.005). In the human study, ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI identified 
the nerve root corresponding to the patient's symptoms, but the nerve root was 
not impinged by structural abnormalities, suggesting the potential superiority 
of this approach over conventional structural imaging techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI can identify tissue and nerve inflammation 
and may provide a promising diagnostic tool in assessing pain conditions in 
humans.

INTRODUCTION: Discitis is an infection of the intervertebral disc space that can 
lead to paralysis, sepsis, epidural abscess, or other life-threatening 
complications if left untreated and may sometimes present with limited 
laboratory abnormalities to clue a diagnosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 67-year-old female in an acute 
rehabilitation setting who had presenting symptoms of sudden unexplained back 
pain refractory to pain control. She had a previous history of discitis and 
multiple failed knee replacement surgeries secondary to MSSA infections. 
Although vitals and basic labs were within normal limits, we recognized the 
clinical presentation as an indicator to order inflammatory markers (CPR and 
ESR), which were elevated compared to levels on admission, and subsequently 
ordered imaging and blood cultures to detect a case of recurrent worsening 
discitis.
DISCUSSION: We highlight the presentation of recurrent discitis and necessary 
low threshold needed to detect such recurrence in patients with a previous 
history of discitis that have sudden unexplained back pain with no other usual 
physical or laboratory indicators of infection.

Many clinical practice guidelines recommend similar approaches for the 
assessment and management of low back pain. Recommendations include use of a 
biopsychosocial framework to guide management with initial non-pharmacological 
treatment, including education that supports self-management and resumption of 
normal activities and exercise, and psychological programmes for those with 
persistent symptoms. Guidelines recommend prudent use of medication, imaging, 
and surgery. The recommendations are based on trials almost exclusively from 
high-income countries, focused mainly on treatments rather than on prevention, 
with limited data for cost-effectiveness. However, globally, gaps between 
evidence and practice exist, with limited use of recommended first-line 
treatments and inappropriately high use of imaging, rest, opioids, spinal 
injections, and surgery. Doing more of the same will not reduce back-related 
disability or its long-term consequences. The advances with the greatest 
potential are arguably those that align practice with the evidence, reduce the 
focus on spinal abnormalities, and ensure promotion of activity and function, 
including work participation. We have identified effective, promising, or 
emerging solutions that could offer new directions, but that need greater 
attention and further research to determine if they are appropriate for 
large-scale implementation. These potential solutions include focused strategies 
to implement best practice, the redesign of clinical pathways, integrated health 
and occupational interventions to reduce work disability, changes in 
compensation and disability claims policies, and public health and prevention 
strategies.

Low back pain is the leading worldwide cause of years lost to disability and its 
burden is growing alongside the increasing and ageing population.1 Because these 
population shifts are more rapid in low-income and middle-income countries, 
where adequate resources to address the problem might not exist, the effects 
will probably be more extreme in these regions. Most low back pain is unrelated 
to specific identifiable spinal abnormalities, and our Viewpoint, the third 
paper in this Lancet Series,2,3 is a call for action on this global problem of 
low back pain.

Paraneoplastic Encephalopathy in a Patient With Metastatic Lung Cancer: A Case 
Study.

Rowley SM(1).

Author information:

Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute.

CASE STUDY RS, a 36-year-old female, presented to the emergency department (ED) 
of a large academic medical center upon the advice of her primary care provider 
because of 3 weeks of progressive mental status changes, weakness, and decreased 
oral intake. According to her husband, RS was diagnosed with stage IIIA large 
cell lung cancer 8 months earlier and was treated with concurrent chemotherapy 
(carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab) and radiation therapy that was 
completed 4 months prior to admission. No other specific information about her 
treatment or outside health records was available. According to her husband, RS 
had been in her usual state of health until approximately 3 weeks prior, when 
she began having significant mental status changes. She first exhibited some 
difficulty finding words and later was noted to be putting food in a coffee 
maker. This spontaneously resolved after approximately 1 week; however, she 
rapidly developed slurred speech and began to make nonsensical statements. These 
manifestations also slowly improved but were followed by worsening speech 
deficit, difficulty walking, and impaired balance. During one of these episodes, 
she had an occurrence of incontinence. Her husband also noted an incident where 
her "eyes were beating back and forth and the left side of her face was 
twitching." RS also had periods (according to her husband) where she "did not 
seem to be interacting with her environment." These progressively worsened 
during the last week, and she completely stopped walking and talking 2 days 
prior to coming to the ED. According to her husband, RS had rheumatoid arthritis 
and no surgical history. Her family history was unknown except that RS's mother 
had "seizures." RS had reportedly not used tobacco, alcohol, or drugs, and she 
was sexually active with her husband. Home medications included transdermal 
fentanyl 12 μg/hr patch changed every 72 hours; oxycodone-acetaminophen tablets 
5-325 mg, two every 4 hours as needed for pain; prednisone 10 mg, one tablet 
daily; and megestrol 40 mg/mL suspension, 20 mL once daily for appetite 
stimulation. RS was admitted to an inpatient medical oncology service and 
evaluated by the oncology advanced practitioner (AP) on her second inpatient 
day. Upon exam, RS was nonverbal except for moaning in response to painful 
stimuli and to her sister's voice. Her vital signs were normal. She appeared ill 
but well-nourished, and she was mildly diaphoretic. Neurologic examination 
revealed that her pupils were slightly sluggish but equal, round, and reactive 
to light. Extraocular muscle movements were intact, but she did not move her 
eyes in response to commands. She tracked the AP and family members around the 
room with her eyes. Cranial nerve examination was intact with the exception of 
cranial nerves IX, X, and XI, which were difficult to examine given her 
inability to cooperate and open her mouth. Motor examination revealed increased 
tone throughout and intermittent, inconsistent resistance to passive movement. 
She was seen to move all four extremities spontaneously although not in response 
to commands. Deep tendon reflexes were intact and equal in all extremities. 
Examination of other body systems was as follows: there was dry, peeling skin on 
her lips, but her mucous membranes were moist and free of erythema or lesions. 
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her heart rate and rhythm were 
regular, there were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and distal pulses were intact. 
Her abdomen was nondistended with normally active bowel sounds in all four 
quadrants. Her abdomen was soft, nontender to palpation, and without palpable 
masses. There was no peripheral discoloration, temperature changes, or edema, 
and examination of her skin was benign. Workup On admission to the emergency 
department, serum laboratory studies were unrevealing for any potential causes 
of encephalopathy. Kidney and liver function were normal, making diagnoses of 
uremic and hepatic encephalopathies less likely. Cultures of the urine and blood 
were negative. Samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained via lumbar 
puncture and were unrevealing for any abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) of 
the head without contrast was negative for any acute intracranial process. 
Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant revealed a single, nonspecific, 
hypoechoic hepatic lesion. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis demonstrated the primary malignancy in the upper lobe of the left lung, 
as well as possible metastatic disease within the left lung, right lung, and 
liver, and widespread osseous metastatic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) of the brain performed 1 day after admission demonstrated numerous 
scattered punctate foci of enhancement throughout the supratentorial and 
infratentorial brain parenchyma, measuring at most 3 to 4 millimeters in 
diameter. There was no significant mass effect or midline shift. A 
paraneoplastic panel was sent to an outside laboratory and returned positive for 
antivoltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) autoantibodies. Differential 
Diagnosis Clinically, RS was exhibiting signs of encephalopathy, a broad term 
that indicates general brain dysfunction, the hallmark of which is altered 
mental status. Diagnosing encephalopathy is challenging, as many differential 
diagnoses must be considered. The clinician must consider metabolic 
derangements, toxic and infectious etiologies, psychiatric disorders, and less 
commonly, prion disorders and progressive dementia. Cultures of RS's blood and 
urine as well as other specialized endocrine tests were negative, decreasing the 
likelihood of a metabolic or infectious cause for her presentation. The 
abnormalities on her brain MRI were reviewed by a neuro-oncology team, who felt 
that the faint, nondescript nature of the visualized lesions was not suspicious 
for metastatic disease. Sequelae of seizures was also considered by 
neuro-oncology but dismissed given a grossly normal prolonged 
electroencephalogram. Some encephalopathies are caused by autoimmune or 
inflammatory mechanisms, which are confirmed by the presence of autoantibody 
markers and/or clear response to immunomodulatory treatment (Vernino, Geschwind, 
& Boeve, 2007). These types of encephalopathies have been seen in patients with 
cancer and have thus been termed paraneoplastic. The presence of anti-VGKC 
antibodies on RS's paraneoplastic panel directed the inpatient medical oncology 
team toward a paraneoplastic neurologic disorder (PND) as the most likely 
diagnosis.

Bertolotti syndrome describes lower back pain secondary to an anatomical 
lumbosacral transitional vertebrae. We present the case of a 37 year old female 
with chronic lower back pain with radiological evidence of an anatomical 
lumbosacral pseudojoint. The patient underwent minimally invasive resection of 
her pseudojoint with complete resolution of symptoms postoperatively. We, as the 
authors would like to highlight that in patients with pain secondary to an 
aberrant lumbosacral articulation, consideration should be given to treatment 
via a minimally invasive technique.

Effect of Stretching on Thoracolumbar Fascia Injury and Movement Restriction in 
a Porcine Model.

Integrative Medicine, Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women's 
Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (HML).

OBJECTIVE: Stretching of fascia is an important component of manual and movement 
therapies. We previously showed that in pigs, a unilateral thoracolumbar fascia 
injury combined with movement restriction (hobble) produced contralateral loss 
of fascia mobility (shear strain during passive trunk flexion measured with 
ultrasound) similar to findings in human subjects with chronic low back pain. We 
now tested whether such abnormalities could be reversed by removing the hobble 
with or without daily stretching for 1 mo.
DESIGN: Thirty pigs were randomized to control, injury, or injury + hobble for 8 
wks. The hobble restricted hip extension ipsilateral to the injury. At week 8, 
the injury + hobble group was subdivided into continued hobble, removed hobble, 
and removed hobble + stretching (passively extending the hip for 10 min daily).
RESULTS: Removing hobbles restored normal gait speed but did not restore fascia 
mobility. Daily passive stretching was not superior to removing hobbles, as 
there was no significant improvement in fascia mobility with either treatment 
group (removed hobble or stretching).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced fascia mobility in response to injury and movement 
restriction worsens over time and persists even when movement is restored. 
Reversing fascia abnormalities may require either longer than 1 mo or a 
different treatment "dose" or modality.

INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) is common in children and adolescents. There 
are many factors that cause LBP, including structural disorders, degenerative 
changes, Scheuermann's disease, fractures, inflammation, and tumors. Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging is the gold standard for diagnosing spinal abnormalities and 
is mandatory when neurological symptoms exist. The study focuses on common MRI 
findings in adolescents with persistent LBP, without history of acute trauma or 
evidence of either inflammatory or rheumatic disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven adolescents were submitted to thoracic and/or 
lumbar spine MRI due to persistent LBP. The protocol consisted of T1 WI, T2 WI, 
and T2 WI with FS, in the axial, sagittal, and coronal plane.
RESULTS: MRI revealed structural abnormalities (scoliosis and kyphosis) in 4/11 
(36.36%); disc abnormalities and endplate changes were found on 11/11 (100%). 
Typical Scheuermann's disease was found in 3/11 (27.27%). Endplate changes were 
severe in Scheuermann's patients and mild to moderate in the remaining 8/11 
(72.72%). Kyphosis was in all cases secondary to Scheuermann's disease. Disk 
bulges and hernias were found in 8/11 (72.72%), all located in the lumbar spine.
CONCLUSION: In adolescents with LBP, structural spinal disorders, degenerative 
changes, and Scheuermann's disease are commonly found on MRI; however, 
degenerative changes prevail.

We report a 55-year-old man with gouty arthritis who developed a 3-month history 
of low back pain, gradual lower extremities weakness and urinary incontinence. 
Lumbar MRI showed an exophytic lesion at L3-L4. Immediately after spinal 
decompression surgery, he developed fever, disorientation, polyarthritis, acute 
kidney injury and leucocytosis. He was treated with multiple antimicrobial 
agents for presumed spinal abscess but did not improve. Multiple body site 
cultures were negative. Aspiration of the sacroiliac joint revealed the presence 
of monosodium uric acid crystals. A diagnosis of acute gout was done, and he was 
treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone and colchicine. Within 
48 hours, he had a remarkable clinical improvement. At discharge, neurological 
and laboratory abnormalities had resolved. Awareness of risk factors for axial 
gout and a high degree of suspicion are important to establish a prompt 
diagnosis and treatment to prevent severe complications as seen in this case.

INTRODUCTION: Degenerative disease of the spine is a generic term encompassing a 
wide range of different disease processes, which leads to spinal instability; 
traumatic/neoplastic events can accelerate this aging process. Therefore, the 
dynamic nature of the spine and its mobility across multiple segments is 
difficult to depict with any single imaging modality.
METHODS: A review of PubMed databases for articles published about kMRI in 
patients with cervical and lumbar spinal desease was performed. We focused on 
the physiopathological changes in the transition from supine to upright position 
in spine instability.
DISCUSSION: Until a few years ago, X-ray was the only imaging modality for the 
spine in the upright position. Of the imaging techniques currently available, 
MRI provides the greatest range of information and the most accurate delineation 
of soft-tissue and osseous structures. Conventional MRI examinations of the 
spine usually are performed in supine position, in functional rest, but the 
lumbar spine instability is often shown only by upright standing. This can 
result in negative findings, even in the presence of symptoms. Regardless, the 
final result is distorted. To overcome this limitation, Kinetic MRI (kMRI) can 
image patients in a weight-bearing position and in ﬂexed and extended positions, 
thus revealing abnormalities that are missed by traditional MRI studies.
CONCLUSION: Despite some limitations, the upright MRI can be a complementary 
investigation to the traditional methods when there are negative results in 
conventional MRI in symptomatic patients or when surgical therapy is scheduled.

BACKGROUND: We noticed that most of active sports children with low back pain 
(LBP) have muscle tightness around the pelvis and reduced trunk flexibility. 
Abnormalities in short-time inversion recovery (STIR) images on magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) can show stress fracture. Therefore, we investigated the 
associations among LBP, trunk flexibility, and lumbar stress fractures.
METHODS: A total of 130 patients under the age of 18 years complained of LBP 
were investigated in STIR MRI images. Among these 130 patients, 65 cases of 
lumbar stress fracture were diagnosed and 65 cases were not diagnosed as a 
lumbar stress fracture. We compared between a group suspected of stress fracture 
(suspected group) and a group of stress fracture(stress fracture group)about 
their trunk flexibility. These groups were investigated about their initial 
trunk flexibility about below items; Finger floor distance (FFD), Heel to 
buttock distance (HBD), straight leg raising (SLR).
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between suspected group and 
stress fracture group about every items; SLR (P < 0.001), FFD (P < 0.01), HBD 
(P < 0.002). Most cases of stress fracture group had reduced trunk flexibility, 
and low flexibility in pelvic area muscles was observed in 93.8% (61/65) of 
cases at the initial examination. Otherwise, that of suspected group was 
73.8%(48/65).
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients of lumbar stress fracture had reduced trunk 
flexibility, and their reduced trunk flexibility might not be caused by LBP. In 
the early diagnosis of lumbar stress fractures using STIR MRI images, there were 
indicated that reduced trunk flexibility was one of helpful item for lumbar 
stress fracture.

PURPOSE: A low cost, reproducible radiographic method of diagnosing congenital 
lumbar spinal stenosis (CLSS) is lacking. We hypothesized that the Cobb angle 
for lumbar lordosis would be smaller in patients with CLSS, based on 
observations in our spine clinic patient population. Here, we compared lumbar 
lordosis Cobb angles with the radiographic ratio method in patients with normal 
spine imaging, degenerative spinal stenosis, and with CLSS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orthopedic surgeons categorized patients with low back 
pain as "Normal," "Degenerative spinal stenosis," and "CLSS" based on clinical 
presentation and findings on lumbar magnetic resonance imaging. We included 30 
patients from each cohort who had undergone lateral lumbar spine radiographs and 
lumbar magnetic resonance imaging. For each lateral radiograph, 2 measurement 
methods were used (1) 4-line lumbosacral Cobb angle between L2-S1 and (2) the 
ratio of the anteroposterior vertebral body diameter and spinal canal 
anteroposterior diameter at the L3 level. We performed logistic regression 
analyses of CLSS prediction by Cobb angle vs the ratio method in all three 
cohorts. Covariates included age, gender, and body mass index.
RESULTS: The radiographic Cobb angles were smaller in CLSS patients when 
compared to the degenerative disease and normal cohorts: a smaller radiographic 
Cobb angle showed higher odds ratio (OR) of predicting CLSS diagnosis compared 
to the radiographic ratio when compared with degenerative disease (OR = 0.28; 
95% CI: 0.11-0.78, P = 0.01) and when compared with the normal cohort (OR = 
0.46; 95% CI: 0.24-0.92, P = 0.03). Radiographic ratio measurements showed no 
difference between the three cohorts (P = 0.12). CLSS was associated with male 
gender (P = 0.04), younger age (P = 0.01), and higher body mass index (P = 
0.01).
CONCLUSION: The radiographic Cobb angle method for lumbar lordosis may be useful 
for raising the possibility of CLSS as the diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the amplitude of intrinsic 
low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in patients with discogenic low-back and leg 
pain (LBLP).
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We obtained and compared the LFO amplitude from 25 
right-handed discogenic LBLP patients (13 males; mean age 55.16±1.83 years) and 
27 well-matched healthy controls (15 males; mean age 52.96±1.63 years). The LFO 
amplitude was examined using the voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency 
fluctuations (ALFFs), and partial correlation analysis was performed to 
determine the relationship between the regions with altered ALFF values and 
clinical parameters in discogenic LBLP patients.
RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the patients with discogenic LBLP 
showed a significant increase in ALFF in the affective system of the pain matrix 
(left anterior cingulate cortex, right anterior insula/frontal operculum, and 
bilateral orbitofrontal cortex) and information-processing regions (middle 
occipital/temporal gyrus). In addition, a significant decrease in ALFF was 
observed in the default mode network (DMN; inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and 
medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC]) and the processing system of the pain matrix 
(basal ganglia/thalamus/midbrain, postcentral gyrus [PoCG], and fusiform gyrus). 
Several regions with altered ALFF were associated with disease duration, visual 
analog scale scores, Barthel index, and fine sensory modality measurements 
(two-point tactile discrimination of the left and/or right leg). Further 
operating characteristic curves analysis suggested that the mean ALFF values in 
the right IPL, left IPL/PoCG, left anterior cingulate cortex, and left mPFC 
could serve as markers to separate individuals with discogenic LBLP from healthy 
subjects.
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed widespread abnormalities in ALFF in the pain 
matrix and information-processing regions as well as a decrease in ALFF in the 
DMN. These results open up an important new avenue to better understand the 
nature of the link between intrinsic activity and peripheral pain and sensory 
impairment in discogenic LBLP patients.

BACKGROUND: Clinical examinations are subjective and often show a low validity 
and reliability. Objective and highly reliable quantitative assessments are 
available in laboratory settings using 3D motion analysis, but these systems are 
too expensive to use for simple clinical examinations. Qinematic™ is an 
interactive movement analyses system based on the Kinect camera and is an 
easy-to-use clinical measurement system for assessing posture, balance and 
side-bending. The aim of the study was to test the test-retest the reliability 
and construct validity of Qinematic™ in a healthy population, and to calculate 
the minimal clinical differences for the variables of interest. A further aim 
was to identify the discriminative validity of Qinematic™ in people with 
low-back pain (LBP).
METHODS: We performed a test-retest reliability study (n = 37) with around 
1 week between the occasions, a construct validity study (n = 30) in which 
Qinematic™ was tested against a 3D motion capture system, and a discriminative 
validity study, in which a group of people with LBP (n = 20) was compared to 
healthy controls (n = 17). We tested a large range of psychometric properties of 
18 variables in three sections: posture (head and pelvic position, weight 
distribution), balance (sway area and velocity in single- and double-leg 
stance), and side-bending.
RESULTS: The majority of the variables in the posture and balance sections, 
showed poor/fair reliability (ICC < 0.4) and poor/fair validity (Spearman <0.4), 
with significant differences between occasions, between Qinematic™ and the 
3D-motion capture system. In the clinical study, Qinematic™ did not differ 
between people with LPB and healthy for these variables. For one variable, 
side-bending to the left, there was excellent reliability (ICC =0.898), 
excellent validity (r = 0.943), and Qinematic™ could differentiate between LPB 
and healthy individuals (p = 0.012).
CONCLUSION: This paper shows that a novel software program (Qinematic™) based on 
the Kinect camera for measuring balance, posture and side-bending has poor 
psychometric properties, indicating that the variables on balance and posture 
should not be used for monitoring individual changes over time or in research. 
Future research on the dynamic tasks of Qinematic™ is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain, a condition that affects many individuals worldwide 
during their lifetime is receiving increasing attention due to the attendant 
chronic disability, absenteeism from work, loss of earning power, loss of 
quality of life and finances. Recently focus has been on the rising prevalence 
and search for steps to address low back pain risk factors now known to be 
modifiable. For the evaluation of low back pain, magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) has emerged as the imaging modality of choice.
AIM: To determine the prevalence and distribution of lumbosacral spine discs, 
osseous, ligamentum flavum and facet joint changes evaluated by MRI. And to 
further understand the lumbosacral spine biomechanics of MRI-related 
disco-osseous abnormalities among native African population with low back pain.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study.
SETTING: University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.
METHODOLOGY: The Lumbosacral spine T1W and T2W sagittal and axial images and 
post gadolinium contrast images generated using a low field MRI scanner and body 
surface coil, in patients with low back pain, were evaluated in line with 
pre-defined spinal changes.
RESULTS: There were a total of one hundred and eight low back pain patients who 
had Magnetic resonance imaging between March 2015 and August 2016 in this study 
with a mean age of 49.9 years and a range of 8 to 77 years. There were 28(25.9%) 
patients aged 50 - 59 years; this age bracket had the highest number while those 
aged 20 years and below were 3.7%. In all, 80(74.1%) subjects had chronic low 
back pain. Abnormal Magnetic resonance findings were reported in 96.3%. Multiple 
disc affectation was seen in 75.3%; disc bulge (79.8%) was the commonest disc 
findings followed by dehydration in 74.0%. The L4/5 discs were commonly affected 
in disc dehydration in 59(76.6%) cases, anterior herniation in 22(61.1%) cases, 
ventrolateral herniations in 9(81.8%) cases, nerve root compression in 21(60%) 
cases, facet joint hypertrophy in 17/24(70.8%) cases and spinal canal stenosis 
in 32/47(68.1%) cases. Vertebral end plate changes occur mostly at L4 and L5 
(74% at each level).
CONCLUSION: This study has shown that Magnetic Resonance Imaging changes in low 
back pain involved multiple discs and multilevel osseous pathologies, however, 
disc abnormalities are predominant. The L4-5, L5-S1 disc levels and L4 vertebra 
body were the most commonly affected sites among a native African population.

The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) represents a condition characterised by a broad 
spectrum of clinical manifestations, laboratory abnormalities and imaging 
features; in particular, SpA is an inflammatory condition in which both 
peripheral and axial joints might be affected. The majority of people with this 
disease have either psoriatic arthritis or axial spondyloarthritis, which 
includes ankylosing spondylitis. Less common subgroups are enteropathic SpA, 
which is associated with inﬂammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and 
ulcerative colitis), reactive arthritis, which can occur in people following 
gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections and undifferentiated SpA, that does 
not meet the diagnostic criteria of the other subgroups at onset, but that may 
evolve to do so later. Very interestingly, much of the emerging data show how 
SpA, during its course, tends to associate with the development of some 
comorbidities; in particular, with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, 
osteoporosis and depressive disorders. Healthcare professionals in 
non-specialist settings do not always recognise the signs and symptoms of SpA, 
particularly spinal symptoms, which may be mistakenly attributed to other causes 
of low back pain, thus leading to significant delays in diagnosis and treatment 
of the disease itself and of its related comorbidities, with consequent disease 
progression and disability, compromising the health-related quality of life of 
patients. In this paper we reviewed the literature of the past year (Medline 
search of articles published from 1st March 2016 to 28th February 2017) with the 
aim of approaching the spectrum of SpA from some different points of view, to 
try to give the reader an insight into this clinically challenging group of 
rheumatic pathologies.

The Termination Level of the Dural Sac Relevant to Caudal Epidural Block in 
Lumbosacral Transitional Vertebrae: A Comparison between Sacralization and 
Lumbarization Groups.

of Korea.

BACKGROUND: Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) are a relatively common 
variant and have been considered as one of the reasons for back pain. It is not 
unusual for clinicians to encounter patients with LSTV who require caudal 
epidural block (CEB) for pain management.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the termination level of the dural sac (DS) and 
anatomical features of the lumbosacral region relevant to CEB in patients with 
LSTV and compared these findings between sacralization and lumbarization groups.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective evaluation.
SETTING: A university hospital with inpatient and outpatient LSTV cases 
presenting low back pain.
METHODS: Four hundred ninety-four LSTV patients were included and categorized 
into sacralization (n = 201) or lumbarization groups (n = 293). Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of all of the LSTV patients were reviewed to determine 
the level of DS termination, the shortest distance between the apex of the 
sacral hiatus and DS, and the presence and the caudal level of sacral perineural 
cysts. Each lumbosacral vertebra column was divided into 3 equal portions 
(upper, middle, and lower thirds). The MRI findings in both of the groups were 
compared and analyzed.
RESULTS: The distribution frequency of the levels of DS termination demonstrated 
a significant difference between the 2 groups. The mean caudal DS level in the 
lumbarization group was significantly lower than the sacralization group (lower 
third of the S2 [131 {44.7%} of 293 patients] vs. lower third of the S1 [78 
{38.8%} of 201 patients]). The DS terminated at the S3 in more than 19% of the 
lumbarization group, whereas in only one case of the sacralization group. 
Although the incidence of perineural cysts was not significantly different 
between the 2 groups, the mean level of caudal margin of perineural cysts in the 
lumbarization group was significantly lower than the sacralization group (middle 
third of the S3 [10 {35.7%} of 28 cases] vs. middle third of the S2 [11 {44%} of 
25 cases]).
LIMITATIONS: This study reveals several limitations including the practical 
challenge of accurate enumeration of the transitional segment and the 
constraints on generalizability posed by the single-country study.
CONCLUSION: When planning CEB for patients with LSTV, pre-procedural MRI to 
check the anatomical structures, including the level of DS termination and 
caudal margin of perineural cysts, would be of great use for lowering the risk 
of unexpected dural puncture during the procedure, especially in the 
lumbarization cases.
KEY WORDS: Termination of the dural sac, dural sac termination, lumbosacral 
transitional vertebrae, transitional vertebra, caudal epidural block.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a global public health problem and a leading cause 
of disability all over the world. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is 
70-80% and a significant proportion of people affected develop chronic low back 
pain (CLBP). Besides a severe negative impact on people's health and 
health-related quality of life, CLBP is associated with substantial costs for 
society. Medical costs for the management of CLBP and costs for production 
losses due to absenteeism from work are sizeable. Pharmaceuticals, physical 
activity, manipulation, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions are 
examples of widely used treatments for CLBP. However, the scientific basis to 
recommend the use of one treatment over another is limited and more research is 
needed to study the effects, costs and cost-effectiveness of treatments for CLBP 
in clinical practice. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness 
(back pain-related functional limitation, back pain intensity, general health, 
health-related quality of life, and working status), costs (medical costs and 
costs for production losses) and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care and 
physiotherapy when added to information and advice in the treatment of patients 
with non-specific CLBP in Sweden.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, where 
participants are recruited through six primary care rehabilitation units (PCRUs) 
in Stockholm County Council, Sweden. Individuals with non-specific CLBP are 
individually randomised to one of four treatment groups: 'information and 
advice'; 'physiotherapy, and information and advice'; 'chiropractic care, and 
information and advice'; or 'chiropractic care, physiotherapy, and information 
and advice'. A sample size of 600 participants will be recruited during a period 
of 33 months. A computer-based questionnaire is used to collect data on back 
pain-related functional limitation (Oswestry Disability Index), pain intensity 
(Numeric Rating Scale), general health (self-rated health), health-related 
quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), and working status (measured as percentage of 
full-time work). Data will be collected at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months 
after baseline.
DISCUSSION: The results from our study should be considered when producing 
evidence-based guidelines and recommendations on which treatment strategies to 
use for CLBP.

RATIONALE: Portal annular pancreas is a rare anatomic variation, where the 
uncinated process of the pancreas connects with the dorsal pancreas and the 
pancreas tissue encases the portal vein (PV), superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or 
splenic vein (SV). Malignancies are quite uncommon in the patients, who have an 
annular pancreas especially portal annular pancreas. Ectopic common hepatic 
artery and absence of the celiac trunk (CT) are the other infrequent 
abnormalities.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 74-year-old man suffered from upper abdominal and back pain.
DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: Contrast enhanced computed tomography indicated a 
low-density mass in the body of the pancreas. Pathological report showed 
adenocarcinoma of the body of pancreas after radical antegrade modular 
pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS).
OUTCOMES: In the operation, we found the superior vein and portal vein was 
surrounded by the pancreatic tissue. The left gastric artery and splenic artery 
originated respectively from abdominal aorta, and celiac trunk was not viewed. 
In addition, the common hepatic artery was a branch from the superior mesenteric 
artery.
LESSONS: In general, this is a novel clinical case of pancreatic carcinoma 
happening in the portal annular pancreas which was accompanied with aberrant 
hepatic artery and absence of the celiac trunk at the same time. Confronted with 
the pancreatic neoplasms, the possibility of coexistent annular pancreas and 
arterial variations should be considered.

BACKGROUND: McKenzie prone press-up exercises have been hypothesised to reduce 
intradiscal pressure, allowing fluid to be reabsorbed into the disc, which could 
improve the internal stability and local chemical milieu of the disc, 
potentially reducing symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immediate effects of prone press-up exercises on 
lumbar disc fluid content and movement.
DESIGN: Quantification of MRI changes before and after a single exercise 
session.
METHODS: The mid-sagittal T2-weighted MR images of 22 volunteers with low back 
pain were obtained before and immediately after performing press-up exercises. 
The whole disc and nucleus regions of the L4-5 and L5-S1 discs were then 
segmented, and their mean signal intensity (MSI) and signal intensity weighted 
centroid (SIWC) were computed to estimate disc fluid content and displacement.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the MSI and the vertical 
position of the SIWC of the whole disc before and after extension at either disc 
level (effect size [ES]: -0.23 to 0.09). There was a significant anterior 
displacement (0.1 ± 5.4 mm) of the location of the SIWC of the disc after 
extension exercise at L4-5 (ES: 0.22), but not at L5-S1 (ES: 0.00) or at either 
level for the nucleus region (ES: -0.06; 0.16).
CONCLUSION: Little evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that press-up 
exercises affect disc fluid content and distribution. Novel parameters 
reflecting fluid distribution detected similar or larger effects of the 
extension than MSI. If such exercises are effective in reducing symptoms, it is 
likely through other mechanisms than by changing fluid content or distribution.

INTRODUCTION: Low back pain and vertebral endplate abnormalities are common 
conditions within the population. Subclinical infection caused by indolent 
pathogens can potentially lead to these findings, with differentiation between 
them notably challenging from a clinical perspective. Progressive infection of 
the intervertebral disc has been extensively associated with increasing low back 
pain, with Propionibacterium acnes specifically implicated with in relation to 
sciatica. The main purpose of this study is to identify if the presence of an 
infective pathogen within the intervertebral disc is primary or is a result of 
intraoperative contamination, and whether this correlates to low back pain.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An open prospective cohort study will be performed. 
Subjects included within the study will be between the ages of 18 and 65 years 
and have a diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation requiring open decompression 
surgery. Excised herniated disc fragments, muscle and ligamentum flavum samples 
will be collected during surgery and sent to microbiology for tissue culture and 
pathogen identification. Score questionnaires for pain, functionality and 
quality of life will be given preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months 
postoperatively. A MRI will be performed 12 months after surgery for analysis of 
Modic changes and baseline comparison. The primary endpoint is the rate of disc 
infection in patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease. The secondary 
endpoints will be performance scores, Modic incidence and volume.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by our Institutional Review 
Board and was only initiated after it (CAAE 65102617.2.0000.0071). Patients 
agreeing to participate will sign an informed consent form before entering the 
study. Results will be published in a peer reviewed medical journal irrespective 
of study findings. If shown to be the case, this would have profound effects on 
the way physicians treat chronic low back pain, even impacting health costs.

OBJECTIVE: We describe our technique and evaluate clinical and radiographic 
outcomes for patients undergoing L4/5 posterior lumbar interbody fusion with 
3D-navigation guided cortical bone trajectory screws (PLIF-CBT) for grade 1 or 2 
degenerative spondylolisthesis with a minimum follow-up time of 12 months.
METHODS: A single-institution series of 18 patients was evaluated with data 
prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Pain and disability scores 
were collected preoperatively and at a minimum of 12 months postoperatively, 
including back and bilateral leg pain visual analog scores (VAS) and Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI) scores. Radiographic fusion was assessed as complete, 
partial, or none based on the presence of bridging bones across the disc space, 
posterior elements, or both.
RESULTS: Patients demonstrated statistically significant reductions in back pain 
VAS (P = 0.0025), leg pain VAS (P < 0.0001), and ODI (P < 0.0001) at a minimum 
of 12 months postoperatively. Radiographic fusion at an average of 14.9 months 
postoperatively was available for 16/18 patients, with 6 patients demonstrating 
fusion (4/6 with complete fusion; 2/6 with partial fusion). There were no 
instances of intraoperative complications or delayed complications requiring 
subsequent interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: PLIF-CBT can be performed in a safe and reproducible fashion with 
excellent clinical outcomes at 1 year postoperatively. The outcomes did not 
correlate with fusion status, which was unexpectedly low at 37.5% without 
significant hardware abnormalities necessitating reoperations. PLIF-CBT offers 
several perioperative advantages compared with traditional open PLIF and 
requires longer-term studies to demonstrate its durability with regard to 
improvement in clinical pain and radiographic endpoints, including anterior 
and/or posterior element fusion.

INTRODUCTION: Adult scoliosis (AS) is the most common spine deformity in adults. 
Back pain is the main symptom leading patients to seek medical consultation. 
Stabilization exercise has been shown effective for reducing back pain. No 
literature review has examined the effects of such exercises in adults with 
scoliosis. The objective was to systematically review the effects of 
stabilization exercises on back pain, disability and quality of life in adults 
with scoliosis.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically searched the following databases from 
inception to March 2017: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, SportDiscus and Cochrane 
Register of Controlled Trials. Selection criteria included: controlled clinical 
trials that compare core stabilization exercise to placebo, no treatment or 
another treatment in participants diagnosed with AS over 18 years old. Studies 
with participants presenting torso or lower extremity surgery, injection in the 
last six months, comorbidity that could affect the spine, red flags signs or 
with a history of spine trauma were excluded. We extracted information about 
participants, treatments, and results on pain, function and quality of life. We 
appraised quality using Cochrane risk of bias. We formulated level of evidence 
summary statements using a priori rules based on quality and consistency of 
results.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We found 630 unique articles and screened the full-text of 
98 articles retrieved. Only one article met all selection criteria and was 
included in this review. Studies were mainly excluded for study design and 
patient population. The included study presented a low risk of bias for all 
criteria except for blinding and reporting if the timing of assessments was 
similar between groups. The literature provides limited evidence from one study 
with high risk of bias that stabilization exercises in the form of 20 weeks of 
active self-correction, task-oriented exercises and cognitive-behavioral therapy 
significantly improves pain, disability and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of AS, there is an important gap in the 
literature with limited evidence reporting the effect of exercise on back pain 
in adults with scoliosis. This review suggest further experimental research is 
needed and formulates research recommendations.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain (LBP) is more prevalent among postmenopausal 
women than men. Ovariectomy (OVX) is an established animal model that mimics the 
estrogen deficiency of postmenopausal women. Little is known about the 
three-dimensional (3D) morphologic properties of cartilage and subchondral bone 
changes in the lumbar facet joint (LFJ) of an OVX mouse model.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the 3D morphologic change 
of cartilage and subchondral bone in the LFJ of an OVX mouse model.
STUDY DESIGN: Three-dimensional visualization and a histologic study on 
degenerative changes in cartilage and subchondral bone in the LFJ of an OVX 
mouse model were conducted.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ovariectomy is performed to mimic postmenopausal changes 
in adult female mice. We present an imaging tool for 3D visualization of the 
pathologic characteristics of cartilage and subchondral bone changes LFJ 
degradation using propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography (PPCT). 
The samples were further dissected, fixed, and stained for histologic 
examination.
RESULTS: Propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography imaging provides a 
3D visualization of altered cartilage with a simultaneous high detail of the 
subchondral bone abnormalities in an OVX LFJ model. A quantitative analysis 
demonstrated that the cartilage volume, the surface area, and thickness were 
decreased in the OVX group compared with the control group (p<.05). Meanwhile, 
these decreases were accompanied by an obvious destruction of the subchondral 
bone surface and a loss of trabecular bone in the OVX group (p<.05). The 
delineation of the 3D pathologic changes in the PPCT imaging was confirmed by a 
histopathologic method with Safranin-O staining. Tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase staining revealed an increased number of osteoclasts in the 
subchondral bone of the OVX mice compared with that of the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that a mouse model of OVX-induced LFJ 
osteoarthritis (OA)-like changes was successfully established and showed a good 
resemblance to the human OA pathology. Propagation-based phase-contrast computed 
tomography has great potential to becomea powerful 3D imaging method to 
comprehensively characterize LFJ OA and to effectively monitor therapeutics. 
Moreover, degenerative LFJ possesses a severe morphologic change in the 
subchondral bone, may be the source of postmenopausal LBP, and has the potential 
to be a novel therapeutic target for LBP treatment.

In this clinical/observational study we have reported the administration of 
Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in patients suffering from radicular lumbar spinal 
pathology, who had no indication for surgical treatment. We analyzed a series of 
100 cases retrospectively, all undergoing clinical and diagnostic 
investigations, which had shown the presence of abnormalities of the vertebral 
body and intervertebral discs, mainly degenerative, such as spondyloarthrosis, 
spondylo-discarthrosis, disc protrusion, excluding disc herniation, which fell 
within surgical cases. We then administered ultramicronized PEA (umPEA) to these 
patients, in combination with paracetamol and codeine, obtaining interesting 
results regarding the improvement of pain symptoms of the spine pathology, in 
the various checks carried out, through the administration of pain assessment 
scales. We also noted its safety due to the total absence of adverse effects. 
The obtained results encourage the use of PEA in degenerative spine pathologies.

Oedema refers to the excessive accumulation of fluid within intercellular 
tissues as a result of disequilibrium between the capillary hydrostatic and 
oncotic pressure gradients. Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) commonly causes lower 
back pain and radicular leg pain. We report a 57-year-old female who presented 
to the neurosurgery clinic of the Bam University of Medical Sciences, Bam, Iran, 
in 2015 with pain and pitting oedema in the bilateral lower extremities. 
Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a diagnosis of LDH of the L3-L4 and L4-L5 
vertebrae. The patient subsequently underwent a bilateral laminotomy and 
foraminotomy of the involved vertebrae to relieve her pain. Following the 
surgery, there was a complete resolution of the LDH-related symptoms as well as 
the oedema. Although LDH has never before been associated with oedema, it may 
nevertheless cause lower limb oedema in exceptional and rare cases, as 
highlighted in this patient.

Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China.

STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study of animal model of Modic changes (MCs) on 
rabbits.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of inducing of MCs by injection of 
Propionibacterium acne (P. acnes) into the lumbar intervertebral discs of 
rabbits.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: MCs have been widely observed, and assume to be 
closely associated with low back pain and P. acnes, but there are few animal 
models showing the progression of MCs.
METHODS: Ten rabbits were used for the study. The L3-4 and L4-5 discs of all 
rabbits were injected with 100 μL P. acnes (1.6 × 10 CFU/mL) as P. acnes group, 
L2-3 disc were injected with 100 μL normal saline as vehicle, and L5-6 disc was 
untreated (blank). MCs were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging before 
operation and at 2 weeks, 1, 3, 4.5, 6, and 9 months postoperatively. Following 
sacrifice, histological analysis, blood test and micro-computed tomography were 
performed. Cytokine expression in nucleus and endplate tissues was quantified 
using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: From 3 months postoperatively, the P. acnes group showed significantly 
decreased T1-weighted signal intensity, whereas the T2-weighted signal was 
significantly higher at 3 and 4.5 months, and then decreased remarkably at 6 and 
9 months. Eleven of 20 inferior endplates were identified as type I MCs at 4.5 
months, and 9 of 20 were identified as type II MCs at 9 months. Real-time 
polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of interleukin-1β, tumor 
necrosis factor α, interferon-γ, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and thrombospondin 
motifs-5 in the nucleus pulposus, and interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, 
and thrombospondin motifs-5 in the endplates, were significantly upregulated 
after injection of P. acnes. Histological slices of discs injected with P. acnes 
showed disc degeneration, endplate abnormalities, and inflammatory response, 
with micro-computed tomography confirming bone resorption.
CONCLUSION: P. acnes infection of the disc can induce degeneration of the disc 
and an inflammatory response in the endplate region, presenting as MCs type I 
and II time dependently.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
studies conducted at the Department of Radiodiagnosis & Imaging of a Tertiary 
Care Armed Forces Hospital between May 2014 and May 2016.
PURPOSE: To assess the advantages of incorporating sagittal screening of the 
whole spine in protocols for conventional lumbar spine MRI for patients 
presenting with low back pain.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Advances in MRI have resulted in faster examinations, 
particularly for patients with low back pain. The additional detection of 
incidental abnormalities on MRI helps to improve patient outcomes by providing a 
swifter definitive diagnosis. Because low back pain is extremely common, any 
change to the diagnostic and treatment approach has a significant impact on 
health care resources.
METHODS: We documented all additional incidental findings detected on sagittal 
screenings of the spine that were of clinical significance and would otherwise 
have been undiagnosed.
RESULTS: A total of 1,837 patients who met our inclusion criteria underwent MRI 
of the lumbar spine. The mean age of the study population was 45.7 years; 66.8% 
were men and 33.2% women. Approximately 26.7% of the patients were diagnosed 
with incidental findings. These included determining the level of indeterminate 
vertebrae, incidental findings of space-occupying lesions of the cervicothoracic 
spine, myelomalacic changes, and compression fractures at cervicothoracic 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that T2-weighted sagittal screening of the whole spine 
be included as a routine sequence when imaging the lumbosacral spine for 
suspected degenerative pathology of the intervertebral discs.

The main reason for waist and back pain in patients with gigantomasty is 
increased thoracic kyphosis and lumber lordosis. These symptoms and abnormal 
spinal angulations regress after reduction mammoplasty operations. However, the 
effect of chronic mechanical stress caused by gigantomasty on the spinal 
degenerative process is not clear yet. In this study with computed tomography it 
is shown that degenerative spondylosis is more widespread and severe in patients 
with large breasts.

BACKGROUND: Muscle strengthening exercises consistently demonstrate improvements 
in the pain and function of adults with knee osteoarthritis, but individual 
response rates can vary greatly. Identifying individuals who are more likely to 
respond is important in developing more efficient rehabilitation programs for 
knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if 
pre-intervention multi-sensor accelerometer data (e.g., back, thigh, shank, foot 
accelerometers) and patient reported outcome measures (e.g., pain, symptoms, 
function, quality of life) can retrospectively predict post-intervention 
response to a 6-week hip strengthening exercise intervention in a knee OA 
cohort.
METHODS: Thirty-nine adults with knee osteoarthritis completed a 6-week hip 
strengthening exercise intervention and were sub-grouped as Non-Responders, 
Low-Responders, or High-Responders following the intervention based on their 
change in patient reported outcome measures. Pre-intervention multi-sensor 
accelerometer data recorded at the back, thigh, shank, and foot and Knee Injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscale data were used as potential predictors 
of response in a discriminant analysis of principal components.
RESULTS: The thigh was the single best placement for classifying responder 
sub-groups (74.4%). Overall, the best combination of sensors was the back, 
thigh, and shank (81.7%), but a simplified two sensor solution using the back 
and thigh was not significantly different (80.0%; p = 0.27).
CONCLUSIONS: While three sensors were best able to identify responders, a 
simplified two sensor array at the back and thigh may be the most ideal 
configuration to provide clinicians with an efficient and relatively unobtrusive 
way to use to optimize treatment.

The Pain Management Task Force of the American College of Rheumatology published 
a report in 2010 highlighting pain management as a fundamental aspect of 
clinical practice, training and research. In the interim, the consideration of 
pain as a focus of attention of rheumatologists and rheumatology health 
professionals has become even more challenging than in 2010 because of the 
epidemic of opiate addiction and overdose death. The characterisation of 
categories of pain by mechanism (e.g., inflammation, joint degeneration, 
abnormalities of central pain processing) can help guide treatment. However, 
such categorisation can overlook the overlap of these processes and their 
interaction to create mixed pain states. Further complicating the assessment of 
pain, outcome measures in rheumatic disease often assess the degree of pain 
indirectly while concentrating on the quantification of inflammation. 
Non-inflammatory pain often persists despite treatment, highlighting the need 
for alternative analgesic therapies. Recommended therapies include 
acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and stimulators of the pain 
inhibitory pathway. Each of these non-opioid therapies has incomplete efficacy 
and potential toxicities that can limit their utility. Non-pharmacologic 
therapies can show efficacy that rivals or surpasses pharmacologic therapies in 
the control of pain and improving function in a variety of rheumatic disorders 
including chronic low back pain and fibromyalgia. A limitation of the use of 
these therapies is inadequate training and appreciation of their benefits. 
Furthermore, the supply of trained practitioners to provide non-pharmacological 
care and support patient efforts for self-management is often limited. Together, 
these considerations suggest the importance of a renewed effort to implement 
task force recommendations.

RATIONALE: The term idiopathic osteoporosis itself is quite a non-specific 
disease label, which fails to address the etiological understanding. Bone 
mineral density alone is not a reliable parameter to detect patients at high 
risk of fracture. The diversity of the clinical phenotypes of discolored teeth, 
blueness of the sclera, back and joint pain, cardiovascular disease, Diabetes 
type II, hearing problems and a long list of orthopedic problems are have to be 
considered.
PATIENTS CONCERNS: Our study has been designed in accordance with the clinical 
and radiological phenotype of eleven index cases with the provisional diagnosis 
of OI, which was followed by genotypic confirmation. This was followed by the 
invitation of siblings, parents, grandparents and other relatives to participate 
in the interviews, and to discuss the impact of the diagnosis. Proper 
collaboration with these families facilitated the process to identify other 
subjects with a history of fractures and other deformities/disabilities which 
were seemingly correlated to heritable connective tissue disorder. In total, 63 
patients (27 children and 36 parents/grandparents and relatives) were enrolled 
in the study. Two groups of children were not included in our study. We excluded 
children with incomplete documentation and children who manifested de novo 
mutation. The term idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) has been given to these 
families in other Institutes and was considered as a definite diagnosis. IOP was 
solely based on T scores, BMD and certain laboratory tests. Surprisingly, no 
single adult patient underwent clinical and or radiological phenotypic 
characterization.
DIAGNOSES: A constellation of significant disease associations with osteoporotic 
fracture risk have been encountered. The index cases showed mutations in COL1A1 
(17q21.31.q22) and COL1A2 (7q22.1), the genes encoding collagen type I. The 
phenotype/genotype confirmation in 11 children was the key factor to boost our 
research and to re-consult each family. Comprehensive clinical and radiological 
phenotypic documentation has been applied to most of other family subjects who 
principally received the diagnosis of IOP.
INTERVENTIONS: All adult patients had normal serum calcium and only three 
patients showed an average of low serum phosphate of 0.7-0.61 mmol/l. 
Serumcrosslaps in six parents was in the average of (2.9-3.8 nM) and PTH levels 
were normal in all patients (the average showed 8.73 pg/ml).
OUTCOMES: Our efforts to minimize and constrain the usage of the term idiopathic 
osteoporosis and to understand the sequence of pathological events that occurred 
in these families were emphasized. These efforts evolved into a remarkable and 
unique constellation of clinical findings. Strikingly, fracture represented a 
portion in a series of skeletal and extra-skeletal deformities and abnormalities 
which are all correlated to connective tissue disorder. This was achieved mainly 
through comprehensive phenotype/genotype confirmation, followed by scrutinizing 
the records of each family, clinical examination of the adults and revising the 
archives of our Hospitals and other Institutes.
LESSONS: The sequence of diverse pathological events recorded within each family 
would be almost incomprehensible without a proper etiological understanding of 
the natural history of each child/family deformity that led to their 
occurrences. We wish to stress that, our current study is just an attempt to 
cover only a tiny fraction of the tip of the iceberg and to profoundly explore 
one of the most under-estimated causes of idiopathic osteoporosis.

BACKGROUND: Palatally displaced canines or PDCs are upper permanent canines, 
commonly known as 'eye' teeth, that are displaced in the roof of the mouth. This 
can leave unsightly gaps, cause damage to the surrounding roots (which can be so 
severe that neighbouring teeth are lost or have to be removed) and, 
occasionally, result in the development of cysts. PDCs are a frequent dental 
anomaly, present in 2% to 3% of young people.Management of this problem is both 
time consuming and expensive. It involves surgical exposure (uncovering) 
followed by fixed braces for two to three years to bring the canine into 
alignment within the dental arch. Two techniques for exposing palatal canines 
are routinely used in the UK: the closed technique and the open technique. The 
closed technique involves uncovering the canine, attaching an eyelet and gold 
chain and then suturing the palatal mucosa back over the tooth. The tooth is 
then moved into position covered by the palatal mucosa. The open technique 
involves uncovering the canine tooth and removing the overlying palatal tissue 
to leave it uncovered. The orthodontist can then see the crown of the canine to 
align it.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of using either an open or closed surgical 
method to expose canines that have become displaced in the roof of the mouth, in 
terms of success and other clinical and patient-reported outcomes.
SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the 
following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 February 
2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the 
Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 February 2017), and 
Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 February 2017). The US National Institutes of Health 
Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing 
trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when 
searching the electronic databases.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled 
trials assessing young people receiving surgical treatment to correct upper 
PDCs. There was no restriction on age, presenting malocclusion or type of active 
orthodontic treatment undertaken. We included unilaterally and bilaterally 
displaced canines.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the 
results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias 
in the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data 
or clarification where feasible. We followed statistical guidelines from the 
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for data synthesis.
MAIN RESULTS: We included three studies, involving 146 participants. Two studies 
were assessed as being at high risk of bias.The main finding of the review was 
that the two techniques may be equally successful at exposing PDCs (risk ratio 
(RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.06; three studies, 141 
participants analysed, low-quality evidence).One surgical failure was due to 
detachment of the gold chain (closed group). One study reported on complications 
following surgery and found two in the closed group: a post-operative infection 
requiring antibiotics and pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain 
penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate.We were unable to pool data for 
dental aesthetics, patient-reported pain and discomfort, periodontal health and 
treatment time; however, individual studies did not find any differences between 
the surgical techniques (low- to very low-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, the evidence suggests that neither the open or 
closed surgical technique for exposing palatally displaced maxillary canine 
teeth is superior for any of the outcomes included in this review; however, we 
considered the evidence to be low quality, with two of the three included 
studies being at high risk of bias. This suggests the need for more high-quality 
studies. Three ongoing clinical trials have been identified and it is hoped that 
these will produce data that can be pooled to increase the degree of certainty 
in these findings.

PURPOSE: This paper evaluates the long-term impact of a Canadian mass media 
campaign on general public beliefs about staying active when experiencing low 
back pain (LBP).
METHODS: Changes in beliefs about staying active during an episode of LBP were 
studied using telephone and web-based surveys. Logistic regression analysis was 
used to investigate changes in beliefs over time and the effect of exposure to 
campaign messaging.
RESULTS: The percentage of survey respondents agreeing that they should stay 
active through LBP increased annually from 58.9 to ~72.0%. Respondents reporting 
exposure to campaign messaging were statistically significantly more likely to 
agree with staying active than respondents who did not report exposure to 
campaign messaging (adjusted OR, 95% CI = 1.96, 1.73-2.21).
CONCLUSION: The mass media campaign had continued impact on public LBP beliefs 
over the course of 7 years. Improvements over time were associated with exposure 
to campaign messaging.

BACKGROUND: Most studies of risk factors for new low back pain (LBP) have been 
conducted in Western populations, but because of cultural and environmental 
differences, the impact of causal factors may not be the same in other 
countries. We used longitudinal data from the Cultural and Psychosocial 
Influences on Disability (CUPID) study to assess risk factors for new onset of 
disabling LBP among Japanese workers.
METHODS: Data came from a 1-year prospective follow-up of nurses, office 
workers, sales/marketing personnel, and transportation workers, initially aged 
20-59 years, who were employed in or near Tokyo. A baseline questionnaire 
included items on past history of LBP, personal characteristics, ergonomic work 
demands, and work-related psychosocial factors. Further information about LBP 
was collected at follow-up. Analysis was restricted to participants who had been 
free from LBP during the 12 months before baseline. Logistic regression was used 
to assess baseline risk factors for new onset of disabling LBP (i.e. LBP that 
had interfered with work) during the 12 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 955 participants free from LBP during the 12 months before 
baseline, 58 (6.1%) reported a new episode of disabling LBP during the 12-month 
follow-up period. After mutual adjustment in a multivariate logistic regression 
analysis, which included the four factors that showed associations individually 
(p < 0.1) in analyses adjusted only for gender and age, the highest odds ratio 
(OR) was for past history of LBP (2.8, 95% [confidence interval {CI}]: 1.6-4.9), 
followed by working ≥60 h per week (1.8, 95% CI: 1.0-3.5) and lifting weights 
≥25 kg by hand (1.6, 95% CI: 0.9-3.0). When past history of LBP was excluded 
from the model, ORs for the remaining risk factors were virtually unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that among Japanese workers, as elsewhere, 
past history of LBP is a major risk factor for the development of new episodes 
of disabling back pain. They give limited support to the association with 
occupational lifting that has been observed in earlier research, both in Japan 
and in Western countries. In addition, they suggest a possible role of long 
working hours, which merits further investigation.

[Purpose] Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of global disability. 
Acupressure is a manual approach that can be used for self-management of LBP. 
The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of acupressure in 
treating chronic LBP. [Subjects and Methods] The research design was a single 
system study utilizing an AB design. The subject was recruited using convenience 
sampling. During phase A, the subject received traditional physical therapy 
interventions. During phase B, the subject received acupressure in addition to 
traditional physical therapy interventions. Outcomes included the Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS), the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and the Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI). [Results] For the VAS, the pain was 38.8 mm at baseline, 
decreased to 11.3 mm after phase A, and decreased to 2.5 mm after phase B. For 
the PSFS, the subject's function was 5/10 at baseline, remained the same after 
phase A, and increased to 9/10 after phase B. For the ODI, the subject's 
disability was moderate (30%) at the baseline, decreased to minimal (14%) after 
phase A, and completely resolved (0%) after phase B. [Conclusion] The data 
indicated that integrating acupressure in physical therapy could reduce pain, 
increase function, and decrease disability.

PURPOSE: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a disabling condition associated with 
narrowing of the spinal canal or vertebral foramina. Paraspinal muscle atrophy 
and fatty infiltration have been reported in patients with chronic LBP and disc 
herniation. However, very few imaging studies have examined paraspinal muscle 
morphology and composition in patients with LSS. The purpose of this study was 
to investigate the association of paraspinal muscle size, composition and 
asymmetry with functional status in patients with LSS.
METHODS: Thirty-six patients diagnosed with LSS at L4-L5 with neurogenic 
claudication were included. Paraspinal muscle measurements were obtained from 
axial T2-weighted MR images, bilaterally, at the level of the superior and 
inferior vertebral endplates of L5. Muscle measurements of interest included: 
total cross-sectional area (CSA), functional CSA (FCSA), the ratio of FCSA to 
CSA (FCSA/CSA) as an indicator of muscle composition, and relative % asymmetry 
in muscle CSA. The association between muscle parameters and other patient 
characteristics with function as indicated from Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) 
scores and pain interference status was investigated.
RESULTS: Greater multifidus muscle fatty infiltration (e.g., lower FCSA/CSA) and 
lower psoas relative CSA were associated with lower function (higher ODI and 
pain interference scores) in univariable and multivariable analyses. There was 
no association between the different muscle parameters and stenosis severity or 
back or leg pain duration or severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest an association of multifidus muscle fatty 
infiltration and psoas muscle size with functional status in patients diagnosed 
with LSS. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether such muscle 
parameters are associated with prognosis and functional recovery following 
surgical treatment.

A Case of Persistent Low Back Pain in a Young Female Caused by a Trauma-Induced 
Schmorl's Node in the Lumbar Spine Five Vertebra.

Physicians are often faced with managing difficult conditions such as chronic 
lower back pain. Intervertebral disk herniation typically occurs horizontally, 
leading to impingement of the spinal cord which can potentially cause radicular 
symptoms or other spinal cord pathologies; however, disk herniations can also 
occur vertically and extend through the endplate of an adjacent cranial or 
caudal vertebra: a phenomenon known as a Schmorl's node. Although Schmorl's 
nodes can be seen in many asymptomatic individuals, they can be a cause of 
degenerative disk disease and low back pain. An 18-year-old female with a 
history of trauma presented to urgent care with increasing lower back pain for 
the past six weeks. Four months prior, she was struck by a motor vehicle while 
riding her bicycle, and she had residual back pain since then. Plain radiography 
at the time of the accident showed no acute abnormalities. She had no other 
associated symptoms. On presentation, her vital signs were within normal limits, 
and her physical examination was largely unremarkable except for point 
tenderness along the lumbar (L4-L5) region of the spine. A complete blood count 
showed no leukocytosis and plain radiography of the lumbosacral spine showed a 
Schmorl's node in the inferior endplate of L5. The patient was diagnosed with a 
trauma-induced Schmorl's node and was treated with physical therapy, ice packs, 
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Her symptoms improved over the next 
several months. For patients with a history of axial load trauma and persistent 
back pain, clinicians should consider the possibility of a trauma-induced 
Schmorl's node. Plain radiography or magnetic resonance imaging can help with 
the diagnosis and guide further management.

BACKGROUND: Nonspecific chronic spinal pain is a common problem within the 
chronic pain population and is characterized by high social, economic and 
personal impact. To date, therapists are still struggling in adequately treating 
these types of patients, as seen in the small and short-term benefits of 
frequently applied primary care treatments. It is remarkable that despite the 
well-documented presence of abnormalities in central nociceptive processing in 
nonspecific chronic spinal pain patients, the implementation of this knowledge 
in clinical practice is still nearly non-existent.
METHODS: This paper provides the treatment protocol used in a large randomized 
controlled trial that aimed to assess the effectiveness of a modern neuroscience 
approach compared to usual care evidence-based physiotherapy. This comprehensive 
pain neuroscience treatment program combines pain neuroscience education and 
cognition-targeted exercise therapy.
CONCLUSION: Based on previous small-scaled studies, this treatment protocol is 
expected to normalize central alterations by addressing central nervous system 
dysfunctions, psychological factors, as well as peripheral dysfunctions in a 
broader biopsychosocially-driven framework.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective single-center.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate rotatory subluxation (RS) in adult spinal deformity 
(ASD) with three-dimensional (3D) stereoradiographic images and analyze 
relationships between RS, transverse plane parameters, spinopelvic parameters, 
and clinical outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Recent research has demonstrated that sagittal plane malalignment 
and listhesis correlate with ASD patient-reported outcomes. However, there is 
still a lack of knowledge regarding the clinical impact of 3D evaluation and 
rotatory subluxation. Recent developments in stereoradiography allow clinicians 
to obtain full-body standing radiographs with low-dose radiation and 3D 
reconstruction.
METHODS: One hundred thirty lumbar ASD patients underwent full-spine biplanar 
radiographs (EOS Imaging, Paris, France). Clinical outcomes were recorded. Using 
sterEOS software, spinopelvic parameters and lateral listhesis were measured. 3D 
transverse plane parameters included apical axial vertebral rotation, axial 
intervertebral rotation (AIR), and torsion index (sum of AIR in the curve). ASD 
patients were divided in three groups: AIR <5°, 5°< AIR <10°, AIR >10°. Groups 
were compared with respect to radiographic and clinical data. Correlations were 
performed between the transverse and sagittal plane parameters and clinical 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Patients with AIR >10° were significantly older, with larger Cobb angle 
(39.5°) and greater sagittal plane deformity (pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis 
mismatch 11.7° and pelvic tilt 22.6°). The AIR >10° group had significantly 
greater apical vertebra axial rotation apex (24.8°), torsion index (45°), and 
upper-level AIR (21.5°) than the two other groups. Overall, 27% of AIR patients 
did not have two-dimensional (2D) lateral listhesis. Patients with AIR >10° had 
significantly worse Oswestry Disability Index and more low back pain.
CONCLUSION: For patients in which lateral listhesis was unreadable in 2D 
imaging, rotatory subluxation was revealed using stereoradiography and at an 
earlier disease stage. Moreover, different 3D transverse plane parameters are 
related to different patient-reported outcomes. Therefore, axial rotation can be 
considered in evaluation of lumbar degenerative scoliosis severity and 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Spinal manipulation (SM) is used commonly for treating low back pain 
(LBP). Spinal stiffness is routinely assessed by clinicians performing SM. 
Flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR) was shown to distinguish between LBP and healthy 
populations. The primary objective of this study was to examine the association 
of these two physiological variables with patient-reported pain intensity and 
disability in adults with chronic LBP (>12 weeks) receiving SM.
METHODS: A single-arm trial provided 12 sessions of side-lying thrust SM in the 
lumbosacral region over 6 weeks. Inclusion criteria included 21-65 years old, 
Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score ≥ 6 and numerical pain 
rating score ≥ 2. Spinal stiffness and FRR were assessed pre-treatment at 
baseline, after 2 weeks and after 6 weeks of treatment. Lumbar spine global 
stiffness (GS) were calculated from the force-displacement curves obtained using 
i) hand palpation, ii) a hand-held device, and iii) an automated indenter 
device. Lumbar FRR was assessed during trunk flexion-extension using surface 
electromyography. The primary outcomes were RMDQ and pain intensity measured by 
visual analog scale (VAS). Mixed-effects regression models were used to analyze 
the data.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 82 participants was 45 years; 48% were female; and 
84% reported LBP >1 year. The mean (standard deviation) baseline pain intensity 
and RMDQ were 46.1 (18.1) and 9.5 (4.3), respectively. The mean reduction (95% 
confidence interval) after 6 weeks in pain intensity and RMDQ were 20.1 mm (14.1 
to 26.1) and 4.8 (3.7 to 5.8). There was a small change over time in the 
palpatory GS but not in the hand-held or automated GS, nor in FRR. The addition 
of each physiologic variable did not affect the model-estimated changes in VAS 
or RMDQ over time. There was no association seen between physiological variables 
and LBP intensity. Higher levels of hand-held GS at L3 and automated GS were 
significantly associated with higher levels of RMDQ (p = 0.02 and 0.03, 
respectively) and lower levels of flexion and extension FRR were significantly 
associated with higher levels of RMDQ (p = 0.02 and 0.008, respectively) across 
the 3 assessment time points.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in pain and disability observed in study participants 
with chronic LBP was not associated with the measured GS or FRR.

Spinal epidural abscess is an uncommon pathology. It has an incidence of one 
case per 100 000 individuals. An increase is observed due to the raise of risk 
factors such as diabetes mellitus, spinal abnormalities, tattoos, acupuncture, 
epidural analgesia, and a greater availability of imaging methods. It is a 
purulent collection located between the dura and the medullary canal. The most 
common germs are Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria. Without 
timely treatment, it evolves to medullary compression and permanent neurological 
sequelae. An 11-year-old girl was admitted with fever of 48 hs evolution, left 
lower back pain, antalgic gait with lumbar stiffness. Neurological examination 
was normal. Blunt blistering lesions were observed on lower limbs. Magnetic 
resonance imaging showed an image compatible with spinal epidural abscess. The 
evolutionwas favorable. Treatment consisted of surgical drainage and antibiotics 
for 6 weeks. From the culture of the material obtained, methidllin-sensitive 
Staphylococcus aureus was isolated.

BACKGROUND: The imaging assessment of paraspinal muscle morphology and fatty 
infiltration has gained considerable attention in the past decades, with reports 
suggesting an association between muscle degenerative changes and low back pain 
(LBP). To date, qualitative and quantitative approaches have been used to assess 
paraspinal muscle composition. Though highly reliable, manual thresholding 
techniques are time consuming and not always feasible in a clinical setting. The 
tedious and rater-dependent nature of such manual thresholding techniques 
provides the impetus for the development of automated or semi-automated 
segmentation methods. The purpose of the present study was to develop and 
evaluate an automated thresholding algorithm for the assessment of paraspinal 
muscle composition. The reliability and validity of the muscle measurements 
using the new automated thresholding algorithm were investigated through 
repeated measurements and comparison with measurements from an established, 
highly reliable manual thresholding technique.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance images of 30 patients with LBP were randomly 
selected cohort of patients participating in a project on commonly diagnosed 
lumbar pathologies in patients attending spine surgeon clinics. A series of 
T2-weighted MR images were used to train the algorithm; preprocessing techniques 
including adaptive histogram equalization method image adjustment scheme were 
used to enhance the quality and contrast of the images. All muscle measurements 
were repeated twice using a manual thresholding technique and the novel 
automated thresholding algorithm, from axial T2-weigthed images, at least 5 days 
apart. The rater was blinded to all earlier measurements. Inter-method agreement 
and intra-rater reliability for each measurement method were assessed. The study 
did not received external funding and the authors have no disclosures.
RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between the two methods with inter-method 
reliability coefficients (intraclass correlation coefficients) varying from 0.79 
to 0.99. Bland and Altman plots further confirmed the agreement between the two 
methods. Intra-rater reliability and standard error of measurements were 
comparable between methods, with reliability coefficient varying between 0.95 
and 0.99 for the manual thresholding and 0.97-0.99 for the automated algorithm.
CONCLUSION: The proposed automated thresholding algorithm to assess paraspinal 
muscle size and composition measurements was highly reliable, with excellent 
agreement with the reference manual thresholding method.

BACKGROUND: Cystic dilation of the ventriculus terminalis (CDVT) is a rare 
anatomic variation that and may become symptomatic. Literature regarding CDVT is 
limited, and thus the clinical characteristics and management strategy of CDVT 
are unclear. Here we report 6 cases of CDVT seen in our institution, and provide 
a review of the current literature.
METHODS: The study cohort comprised 6 patients with CDVT seen at Beijing Tiantan 
Hospital between September 2010 and June 2015. All 6 patients were managed 
surgically. Data on age, sex, clinical presentation, radiologic features, 
operative methods, and surgical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. We 
evaluated the clinical outcomes and postoperative radiologic changes of these 
patients and compared them with findings of similar previous reports.
RESULTS: All 6 patients were female, with a median age of 50.0 years 
(interquartile range [IQR], 25.8-54.0 years). Surgical management of 
cyst-subarachnoid shunting using T-catheter after myelotomy was successfully 
performed in all patients. During an average follow-up of 41 months, relief of 
clinical symptoms, especially low-back pain and sciatica, were observed in all 6 
patients. No patients experienced symptom recurrence during follow-up, and 
postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed no regrowth of the lesion. 
Patients with focal neurologic deficits and sphincter disorders also achieved 
symptom relief from the procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: CDVT is an extremely rare cause of conus medullaris syndrome with 
an unclear treatment strategy. Our successful surgical management of 6 cases 
through cystic-subarachnoid shunting using a T-catheter for CDVT drainage 
provides a potential option for treating CDVT.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of 
local injection of a local anesthetic with a glucocorticoid versus a local 
anesthetic with saline to treat low back pain due to lumbosacral transitional 
vertebras (LSTV) with a pseudoarticulation.
METHODS: A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study was conducted in 
patients with unilateral low back pain ascribed clinically to LSTV. Patients 
were randomized to lidocaine plus saline (LS group) or lidocaine plus cortivazol 
(LC group) injected locally under computed tomography guidance. The primary 
outcome measure was the 24-hour mean visual analog scale (VAS) score for low 
back pain 4 weeks after the injection.
RESULTS: Of 16 randomized patients, 15 were included in the analysis, 8 in the 
LS group and 7 in the LC group. The mean VAS pain score at week 4 was not 
significantly different between the two groups. In the two groups pooled, the 
mean VAS pain score decreased significantly from baseline to week 4, from 
5.52±0.99 to 3.86±2.55 (P≤0.05). The difference remained significant at week 12. 
Significant improvements occurred in the EIFEL disability index and items of the 
Dallas Pain Questionnaire. No adverse events were recorded.
CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic low back pain consistent with a symptomatic 
LSTV type II or IV in the Castellvi classification, a local injection of 
lidocaine with or without cortivazol may provide sustained improvements in pain 
and function. The underlying mechanism is unclear.

INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSCP) is a reference operation for 
apical compartment prolapse repair. Aim of this study is to describe the early 
and midterm postoperative MRI findings of the lumbosacral region (LSR) in 
patients undergoing LSCP and to detect any imaging changes that the presence of 
the mesh may cause on patients with preexisting degenerative disease of the LSR.
METHODS: Patients with POP-Q grade III and IV uterovaginal or vaginal vault 
prolapse who were considered eligible for LSCP were invited to participate. An 
MRI of the LSR was performed preoperatively and then 3 and 12 months 
postoperatively. Patients with vaginal vault prolapse underwent LSCP, while 
women with uterovaginal prolapse were treated with the vaginally assisted 
laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (VALS).
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were included in the study; 18 (60%) underwent 
LSCP and 12 (40%) VALS. On preoperative MRIs, 83.3% (25/30) of patients had 
degenerative changes and 70% (21/30) reported having low back pain (LBP). 
Postoperative MRIs did not reveal any imaging changes compared to the 
preoperative MRI findings both for patients with or without preexisting 
degenerative abnormalities of the LSR. No significant changes in the LBP score 
were observed postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Any bone marrow or soft-tissue changes at MRIs of the LSR early 
after the insertion of a synthetic mesh, does not constitute an expected 
postoperative finding and should raise the suspicion of an ongoing inflammatory 
or infectious spinal process (spondylodiscitis). Additionally, LSCP seems to be 
a safe surgical approach for women with preexisting degenerative disease of the 
LSR.

Grande do Sul. Brazil.

Congenital absence of the inferior vena cava is a rare vascular anomaly, and 
most cases are asymptomatic. Nevertheless, patients with inferior vena cava 
malformations may have increased risk of deep venous thrombosis. Particularly, 
cases of bilateral deep venous thrombosis may arise owing to an insufficient 
collateral venous drainage from the lower limbs. We hereby describe a case of 
a previously healthy young male patient presenting with bilateral lower limb 
deep venous thrombosis as the initial clinical manifestation of congenital 
inferior vena cava agenesis. We conclude that in young patients presenting with 
deep venous thrombosis, especially when thrombosis occurs spontaneously, 
bilaterally, or recurrently, inferior vena cava anomalies should be thoroughly 
investigated and ruled out as appropriate.

Publisher: A Ausência congênita da veia cava inferior é uma anomalia vascular 
rara e a maioria dos casos são assintomáticos. No entanto, pacientes com 
malformações da veia cava inferior possuem um risco aumentado de trombose venosa 
profunda. Notavelmente, casos de trombose venosa profunda bilateral podem 
ocorrer em decorrência de drenagem venosa colateral insuficiente dos membros 
inferiores. Apresentamos aqui o caso de um doente que veio à nossa instituição 
apresentando trombose venosa profunda bilateral de membros inferiores como 
manifestação inicial de agenesia da veia cava inferior. Concluímos que em 
pacientes jovens apresentando trombose venosa profunda, especialmente quando a 
trombose ocorrer espontaneamente, bilateralmente, ou de forma recorrente, 
anomalias da veia cava inferior devem ser extensamente investigadas e 
descartadas.

According to the original description by Modic et al., the natural course of 
bone marrow signal abnormalities is an inexorable, progressive one, however 
recent evidence has demonstrated in healthy individuals and those suffering from 
lumbar disc herniation that the course of endplate degenerative changes is 
rather dynamic and sometimes regressive. The evolution of such changes in lumbar 
fused segments and adjacent levels is largely unknown. The literature relevant 
to the course of Modic changes on fused and adjacent levels, as well as its 
clinical correspondence in patients undergoing posterolateral lumbar fusion was 
collected. Two studies met the criteria. Of 38 patients with Modic type I 
signals preoperatively, 6 regressed to type 0, 22 progressed to type 2, and 10 
remained the same postoperatively. Of 12 patients with Modic type 2 signals 
preoperatively, 2 regressed to type 0 and 10 remained the same postoperatively. 
None of the articles described the Modic changes in adjacent levels. Clinical 
and functional outcomes were significantly improved at follow-up regardless of 
the endplate signal changes. The best available evidence points out to a 
reduction in Modic type I frequency on fused segments, either regressive or 
progressive. There was a predominance of new type II changes in postoperative 
images, which might represent improvement of instability. This study calls into 
attention the controversial role of Modic changes as an indicator of clinical 
significance, since clinical and functional outcomes significantly improved 
regardless of the endplate signal changes.

OBJECTIVE: There is an extensive relationship between chronic pain and 
depression; however, there is less research examining whether pain-specific 
factors, such as pain intensity, predict depression, above and beyond the role 
of normative factors, such as positive emotions. The current study characterized 
the independent contributions of pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and a 
trait measure of happiness to self-rated depressive symptoms.
METHODS: We recruited and enrolled 70 volunteers across 3 groups of 
participants: two groups of patients with current low back pain (one group on 
opioids and one group opioid-naïve), and individuals in a methadone maintenance 
treatment program.
RESULTS: Of note, participants reporting concurrent opioid use reported 
significantly higher levels of depressive symptomatology, although study groups 
did not differ on any other clinical variables. In our path model, we failed to 
find direct relationships between pain (intensity or duration) and either trait 
happiness or depressive symptoms (p > .05). However, our analysis did reveal 
that individuals with chronic back pain who reported higher levels of trait 
happiness reported lower levels of depressive symptomatology; this effect was 
significantly mediated by lower levels of pain catastrophizing (standardized ab 
= -.144, p = .002).
CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that trait happiness, while unrelated to 
ongoing pain, may predict a decreased vulnerability to depressive symptoms in 
individuals with chronic pain, which may operate via lower levels of pain 
catastrophizing.

Back pain is one of the most common presentations to the emergency department. 
Though case reports of patients presenting with increased back pain following 
chiropractic spinal manipulations are rare, we have identified a case rarely 
reported in the literature where a potential injury from chiropractic 
manipulation resulted in a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. We have reported a 
previously healthy 66-year-old male who presented with persistent lower back 
pain over 4 weeks. An initial evaluation with thoracolumbar radiographs revealed 
no significant findings. Following initial presentation to the family physician, 
the patient underwent three treatments of spinal manipulation from his local 
chiropractor, which resulted in worsening lower back pain. A re-examination and 
new radiographs in the hospital revealed multiple compression fractures and an 
underlying diagnosis of multiple myeloma. We have explored current literature 
examining the prevalence of lower back pain, as well as the incidence of spinal 
fracture following chiropractic manipulation, and have highlighted a potential 
complication from chiropractic manipulation in a patient with an undiagnosed 
underlying neoplastic disorder.

PURPOSE: This population-based cohort study investigated the association between 
a lifetime history of a low back injury in a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and 
future troublesome low back pain. Participants with a history of a low back 
injury in a motor vehicle collision who had recovered (no or mild low back pain) 
were compared to those without a history of injury. Current evidence from two 
cross-sectional and one prospective study suggests that individuals with a 
history of a low back injury in a MVC are more likely to experience future LBP. 
There is a need to test this association prospectively in population-based 
cohorts with adequate control of known confounders.
METHODS: We formed a cohort of 789 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults with no 
or mild LBP. At baseline, participants were asked if they had ever injured their 
low back in a MVC. Six and 12 months later, participants were asked about the 
presence of troublesome LBP (grade II-IV) on the Chronic Pain Grade 
Questionnaire. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was 
used to estimate the association while controlling for known confounders.
RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 74.8% (590/789) at 6 months and 64.5% (509/789) 
at 12 months. There was a positive crude association between a history of low 
back injury in a MVC and the development of troublesome LBP over a 12-month 
period (HRR = 2.76; 95% CI 1.42-5.39). Controlling for arthritis reduced this 
association (HRR = 2.25; 95% CI 1.11-4.56). Adding confounders that may be on 
the casual pathway (baseline LBP, depression and HRQoL) to the multivariable 
model further reduced the association (HRR = 2.20; 95% CI 1.04-4.68).
CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that a history of low back injury in a MVC is 
a risk factor for developing future troublesome LBP. The consequences of a low 
back injury in a MVC can predispose individuals to experience recurrent episodes 
of low back pain.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Multiple radiologic modalities are used in the 
evaluation of patients with low back pain (LBP). Only limited evidence currently 
exists to support the use of bone hydroxydiphosphonate single photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in patients with Modic changes (MCs) and 
degenerative disc disease. The aim of this study was to assess the value of the 
hybrid bone SPECT/CT imaging in patients with chronic LBP. We evaluate the 
correlation of hybrid bone SPECT/CT imaging patterns with MCs and disc 
abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: This was a prospective study. Ninety-nine consecutive patients with LBP 
from a single center. The degree of lumbar intervertebral disc and endplate 
degeneration on MRI and osteoblastic activity was shown on SPECT/CT. These 99 
consecutive patients with LBP were prospectively evaluated. Patients with 
contemporary lumbosacral spine MRI and bone SPECT/CT were included. Patients 
with known or suspected malignancy, trauma, infectious processes, and previous 
surgery were excluded. The effect of LBP on the daily quality of life was 
assessed using Oswestry disability index. We analyzed the correlation between 
the degenerative changes at the intervertebral disc spaces and endplates on MRI 
and bone SPECT/CT findings using receiver operating characteristic curve 
analysis and Kappa statistics. The Pfirrmann grading system was used to score 
the severity of disc space degeneration on MRI scans.
RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were included in the study (58 women, 41 men; 
mean age, 56.2 years). Mean Oswestry disability index score was 38.5% (range, 
8%-72%). The L2-3 through to L5-S1 levels were studied. MCs were found in 54% of 
patients. Of the 396 levels examined 85 were found to have MCs (21.5%). The most 
affected levels were L4-5 (31.3%) and L5-S1 (40.9%). Pfirrmann grade 5 disc 
space (72.9%) was associated with MC (Pp<0.001). MC (70.6%) and Pfirrmann grade 
5 disc spaces (73%) resulted in scintigraphically active endplate/disc space on 
SPECT/CT (P< 0.001). Bone SPECT/CT showed high metabolic activity in 96.1% of 
endplates with MC type I, 56% with MC type II, and 77.8% with MC type III.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found a high agreement between MCs and increased 
metabolic activity on bone SPECT/CT imaging. MC type 1 and Pfirrmann grade 5 
were the best binary predictors for positivity on bone SPECT/CT and had 
equivalent correlations. Lower vertebral levels in the lumbar spine were 
associated with higher degree of disc degeneration, high frequency of MCs, and 
positivity on bone SPECT/CT.

PURPOSE: A considerable portion of chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients lack 
anatomical abnormality, resist conventional therapeutic interventions, and their 
symptoms are often complicated with psychological and social factors. Such 
patients have been reported to show cerebral abnormalities both in anatomy and 
function by neuroimaging studies. Here we examined differences in cerebral 
reactivity to a simulated low back pain stimulus between cLBP patients and 
healthy controls by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and their 
behavioral correlates from a psychophysical questionnaire.
METHODS: Eleven cLBP patients and 13 healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled in this 
study. After psychophysical evaluation on-going pain with McGill Pain 
Questionnaire Short Form (MPQ), they underwent whole-brain fMRI in a 3-Tesla MRI 
scanner while receiving three blocks of 30-s mechanical pain stimuli at the left 
low back with a 30-s rest in between, followed by a three-dimensional anatomical 
imaging. Functional images were analyzed with a multi-subject general linear 
model for blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes associated 
with pain. Individual BOLD signal amplitudes at activated clusters were examined 
for correlation with psychophysical variables. Two in the cLBP and five data 
sets in the HS groups were excluded from analysis because of deficient or 
artifactual data or mismatch in age.
RESULTS: The HS group showed LBP-related activation at the right insular cortex, 
right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left anterior cingulate cortex 
(ACC), and left precuneus; and deactivation in a large area over the parietal 
and occipital cortices, including the bilateral superior parietal cortex. On the 
other hand, the cLBP group did not show any significant activation at those 
cortical areas, but showed similar deactivation at the bilateral superior 
parietal cortex and part of the premotor area. An HS > cLBP contrast revealed 
significantly less activity at the ACC and DLPFC in the cLBP group, which was 
negatively correlated with higher MPQ scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The cLBP patients showed attenuated reactivity to pain at the ACC 
and DLPFC, known cortical areas mediating affective component, and top-down 
modulation, of pain. The present results might be associated with possible 
dysfunction of the descending pain inhibitory system in patients with chronic 
low back pain, which might possibly play a role in chronification of pain.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Schwab classification for adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS) 
concluded that health-related quality of life was closely related to curve type 
and three sagittal modifiers. It was suggested that pelvic incidence minus 
lumbar lordosis value (PI-LL) should be corrected within -10°~+10°. However, 
recent studies also indicated that ideal clinical outcomes could also be 
achieved in patients without the ideal PI-LL mentioned above.
PURPOSE: This study evaluated the relation between the clinical outcomes and the 
PI-LL of Chinese patients with ADS who received long posterior internal fixation 
and fusion.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a single-center retrospective comparative study of 
patients treated by long posterior internal fixation and fusion in our hospital 
between 2010 and 2014.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Inclusion criteria were age >45 years at the time of surgery, 
Cobb angle of lumbar curves ≥10°, long posterior internal fixation and fusion 
≥least 3 motion segments, follow-up ≥2 years, complete preoperative and 
postoperative radiographic data, and functional evaluation results. Exclusion 
criteria were history of previous lumbar spine surgery, other kinds of 
scoliosis, history of severe spinal trauma, spinal tumor, ankylosing 
spondylitis, and spinal tuberculosis. Seventy-four patients were enrolled in 
this study.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Operative parameters included intraoperative blood loss, 
duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, number of fusion levels, and 
decompression. The radiological measurements included Cobb angle of the curves 
and PI-LL. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by the Japanese Orthopaedic 
Association score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analog scale, and 
Lumbar Stiffness Disability Index (LSDI). In addition, the complications of 
surgery were also collected. One-way analysis of variance, Student t test, 
Kruskal-Wallis test, Pearson chi-square test, and curve estimation were 
calculated for variables.
METHODS: All the patients were divided into Group 1 (long instrumentation and 
fusion to L5) and Group 2 (long instrumentation and fusion to S1). Operative 
parameters, radiological measurements, clinical outcomes, and complications of 
surgery were compared between two groups to confirm whether distal fusion level 
could influence therapeutic effect. Then patients were divided into PI-LL<10° 
(Group A), 10°≤PI-LL≤20° (Group B), PI-LL>20° (Group C). Operative parameters, 
radiological measurements, clinical outcomes, and complications of surgery were 
compared between each of the two groups. Curve estimation was performed to 
evaluate the relationship between postoperative PI-LL and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: No difference was found between Group 1 and Group 2 in all 
postoperative parameters (p>.05). There were significant differences in final 
ODI (p<.001) and final LSDI (p<.001) among Group A, Group B, and Group C. Cubic 
curve model fitted the relationship between PI-LL and final ODI better than 
other models (R2=0.379, p<.001). Cubic curve model fitted the relationship 
between PI-LL and final LSDI better than other models (R2=0.691, p<.001). There 
was a significant difference in proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) among groups 
(p=.038). No significant difference was found in other parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimal PI-LL value may be achieved between 10° and 20° in Chinese 
patients with ADS after long posterior instrumentation and fusion surgery with 
excellent clinical outcomes and a lower PJK occurrence.

Ultrasonography imaging has been used as a non-invasive method to estimate the 
thickness and relative activities of the abdominal muscles in patients with 
lower back pain (LBP). However, the statistical reliability of US thickness 
measurements of abdominal muscles, including transversus abdominis (TrA), 
internal oblique (IO) and external oblique (EO) muscles during abdominal 
hollowing (AH) and abdominal bracing (AB) maneuvers has not been 
well-investigated. This study was performed on a total of 20 female subjects (10 
with LBP and 10 without LBP) in the age range of 25-55 years to assess 
within-day and between-day reliability of the measurements. US measurements on 
maneuvers were repeated after two hours for the within-day reliability and after 
five days for the between-day reliability assessment. High intra-class 
correlation coefficient (ICC) values (>0.75) for within-day and between-day 
reliability assessments during AH maneuver were concluded. The ICC values were 
moderate for reliability assessment during AB. The ICC values for AH were 
greater than AB both for within- and between-day reliabilities. The small 
standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change values (0.16-0.78 
and 0.44 to 2.15, respectively) were found for both AH and AB. We recommend 
real-time US imaging as a reliable way of determining the thicknesses of the TrA 
and IO muscle (and to some extent, EO muscle) for both healthy and LBP patients.

OBJECTIVES: Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) is an initiative to encourage 
patient-physician discussions about the appropriate, evidence based use of 
medical tests, procedures and treatments. We present the Canadian Association of 
Emergency Physicians' (CAEP) top five list of recommendations, and the process 
undertaken to generate them.
METHODS: The CAEP Expert Working Group (EWG) generated a candidate list of 52 
tests, procedures, and treatments in emergency medicine whose value to care was 
questioned. This list was distributed to CAEP committee chairs, revised, and 
then divided and randomly allocated to 107 Canadian emergency physicians (EWG 
nominated) who voted on each item based on: action-ability, effectiveness, 
safety, economic burden, and frequency of use. The EWG discussed the items with 
the highest votes, and generated the recommendations by consensus.
RESULTS: The top five CAEP CWC recommendations are: 1) Don't order CT head scans 
in adults and children who have suffered minor head injuries (unless positive 
for a validated head injury clinical decision rule); 2) Don't prescribe 
antibiotics in adults with bronchitis/asthma and children with bronchiolitis; 3) 
Don't order lumbosacral spinal imaging in patients with non-traumatic low back 
pain who have no red flags/pathologic indicators; 4) Don't order neck 
radiographs in patients who have a negative examination using the Canadian 
C-spine rules; and 5) Don't prescribe antibiotics after incision and drainage of 
uncomplicated skin abscesses unless extensive cellulitis exists.
CONCLUSIONS: The CWC recommendations for emergency medicine were selected using 
a mixed methods approach. This top 5 list was released at the CAEP Conference in 
June 2015 and should form the basis for future implementation efforts.

Purpose Temporary job accommodations contribute to the prevention of chronic 
work disability due to low back pain (LBP) through the facilitation of early 
return to work; yet, workplace dimensions of job accommodation are poorly 
understood. The objective of this study was to determine supervisor and 
organizational factors associated with supervisors' support for temporary job 
accommodations for LBP injured workers. Methods Supervisors were recruited from 
19 workplaces in the USA and Canada and completed an online survey regarding job 
accommodation practices and potential associated factors with respect to a case 
vignette of a worker with LBP. Multivariable linear regression was used to 
identify the most parsimonious set of factors associated with supervisors' 
support for accommodations. Results A total of 804 supervisors participated with 
796 eligible for inclusion in the analysis. The final set of factors explained 
21 % of the variance in supervisors' support for temporary job accommodations. 
Considerate leadership style (β = 0.261; 95 % CI 0.212, 0.310), workplace 
disability management policies and practices (β = 0.243; 95 % CI 0.188, 0.298), 
and supervisor autonomy for designing and providing workplace accommodations 
(β = 0.156; 95 % CI 0.071, 0.241) had the largest effect on supervisor support 
for accommodations. Conclusion Factors predicting supervisors' likelihood to 
accommodate LBP injured workers include use of considerate leadership style, 
workplace disability management policies and practices, and supervisor autonomy. 
Workplace interventions targeting these factors should be developed and 
evaluated for their ability to improve work disability prevention outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To determine in a cohort of young patients with suspected axial 
spondyloarthritis (axSpA), the prevalence of lumbosacral transitional vertebra 
(LSTV), its association with local bone marrow edema (BME) and lumbar spine 
degeneration, and the potential relationship with MRI findings and clinical 
signs of axSpA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline imaging studies and clinical information of 
patients from the SPondyloArthritis Caught Early-cohort (back pain ≥3 months, 
≤2 years, onset <45 years) were used. Two independent readers assessed all 
patients for LSTV on radiography, and BME-like and degenerative changes on MRI. 
Patients with and without LSTV were compared with regard to the prevalence of 
MRI findings and the results of clinical assessment using Chi-squared test or t 
test.
RESULTS: Of 273 patients (35.1% male, mean age 30.0), 68 (25%) patients showed 
an LSTV, without statistical significant difference between patients with and 
without axSpA (p = 0.327). Local sacral BME was present in 9 out of 68 (13%) 
patients with LSTV and absent in patients without LSTV (p < 0.001). Visual 
analogue scale (VAS) pain score and spinal mobility assessments were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: LSTV is of low clinical relevance in the early diagnosis of axSpA. 
There is no difference between patients with and without LSTV regarding the 
prevalence of axSpA, pain and spinal mobility, and a BME-like pattern at the 
pseudoarticulation does not reach the SI joints.

Background Bertolotti syndrome is characterized by an abnormal enlargement of 
the transverse process of the most caudal lumbar vertebra. Most of the time it 
is asymptomatic, but when it is symptomatic it is associated with low back pain, 
radiating leg pain, or both. There is no consensus regarding management of this 
pathology. Open to minimal invasive tubular resection techniques are described 
in the literature, but a full endoscopic resection technique has not yet been 
described. Endoscopic technique is a less invasive target-oriented iliolumbar 
ligament preserving technique. We report our percutaneous full endoscopic 
technique for the treatment of symptomatic Bertolotti syndrome. Method We have 
treated three symptomatic cases of Bertolotti syndrome with the percutaneous 
endoscopic technique. We review the feasibility of this technique and the 
outcomes. Result Full endoscopic resection of Bertolotti syndrome is feasible 
and safe with comparable good outcomes and the added benefits of minimal 
invasive surgery. Conclusion We believe this novel percutaneous full endoscopic 
technique will yield good results in the hands of expert endoscopic spine 
surgeons and can be an alternative treatment method in cases of symptomatic 
Bertolotti syndrome. To our knowledge this is the first report of percutaneous 
full endoscopic treatment of Bertolotti syndrome in the world.

Electromyography (EMG)-based measures of the trunk muscles behavior have been 
used for objective assessment of biomechanical impairments in patients with low 
back pain (LBP); yet the literature on normal age-related differences in such 
measures is scant. A cross-sectional study was designed to assess age-related 
differences in activity of trunk extensors during forward bending and backward 
return. Sixty asymptomatic individuals were recruited to form five 
gender-balanced age groups between 20 and 70 years old. Participants completed 
two sets of trunk forward bending and backward return task using self-selected 
and fast motion paces. For bending and return phases of each task, the 
normalized lumbar flexion angles corresponding to different event times of 
erector spinae activity along with the peak normalized and non-normalized EMG 
activities of erector spinae were calculated. The mean normalized and 
non-normalized EMG activities of erector spinae during the entire task also were 
calculated. There was no age-related difference in normalized lumbar flexion 
angles corresponding to different event times of erector spinae activity. 
However, the peak normalized EMG activity during forward bending and backward 
return as well as the mean normalized EMG activity during the entire task were 
found to be larger in older vs. younger individuals. Given the suggested 
unreliability of normalized EMG in elders and considering that we did not find 
any age-related differences in non-normalized EMG activity of erector spinae, 
our results do not strongly support the existence of normal age-related 
differences in EMG profile of erector spinae during forward bending and backward 
return. Therefore, when interpreting EMG-based measures of trunk muscles 
behavior for identification of biomechanical impairment in patients with LBP, 
potential abnormalities in EMG activity of trunk muscles may not be attributed 
to patient's age.

Previous studies of posture in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients focused on the 
pathophysiology of severe deformities, using mainly subjective estimations or 
goniometric measures. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors 
associated with flexed posture in PD and their effects on the course of posture 
variations. One hundred-ninety patients with definite PD were prospectively 
evaluated for angles of spinal inclination in upright position, extension, and 
flexion using a mechanical computer-assisted, hand-held device (SpinalMouse). 
Patients underwent clinical examination, including background data and bone 
mineral density. Motor function was evaluated with the UPDRS, and back pain with 
the RMDQ. Physical activity data were collected by self-report. Postural 
measurements were repeated after 10-17 months. Angle of upright inclination 
correlated with age (p = 0.0004), older age at disease onset (p = 0.0085), 
longer disease duration (p = 0.003), higher UPDRS motor and posture score 
(p = 0.0005 and 0.0001), the presence of back-pain (p = 0.0097), and 
osteoporosis (p = 0.027). There was no correlation between upright angle of 
inclination and gender, disease type, or side of disease onset. Re-evaluation of 
posture in 124 patients at 13.77 ± 4.4 months after the initial evaluation 
showed significant deterioration in forward bending (p < 0.0001) and was 
significantly associated with disease duration (p = 0.029), worsening of the 
UPDRS score (p = 0.016), right-side disease onset (p = 0.032), presence of 
vertebral fractures (p = 0.049), and the lack of physical activity (p = 0.0327). 
Older age, disease severity and duration, presence of back-pain and osteoporosis 
are associated with postural abnormalities in PD. Physical activity might slow 
the worsening of postural abnormalities in PD.

Spinal fusion via anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) can offer symptomatic 
relief to patients that suffer severe low back pain, radiculopathy, and 
claudication. However, a detailed working knowledge of the thoracic, abdominal, 
and lumbar anatomy, particularly of the vasculature, is vital. We report the 
case of a 68-year-old man who presented with radiculopathy and progressively 
worsening low back pain despite 9 months of unsuccessful conservative therapy 
and pain management. Preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance 
imaging revealed a rare anatomical variation, with an anomalous left-sided 
inferior vena cava and anomalous aorta. The patient was surgically treated with 
ALIF at L4,5 and L5 S1 via an altered surgical window. Given the anomalous 
anatomy of the patient, instead of performing the procedure after mobilizing 
both of the transposed abdominal great vessels, the inferior vena cava and the 
abdominal aorta, the ALIF was uneventfully performed in the window between these 
vessels. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. At 12-week 
postoperative follow-up, X-ray imaging demonstrated successful implantation of 
ALIF cages with no recurrence of symptoms. A detailed working knowledge of 
anatomy is important, particularly if anatomical variations are present. This 
has implications for preoperative surgical planning, which is integral to the 
safety and the success of procedures.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of neural axis 
abnormalities and the relevant risk factors in patients with adolescent 
idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The use of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
to assess the whole spine in patients with idiopathic scoliosis is 
controversial, and indications for such MRI evaluations have not been 
definitively established. However, we routinely use whole-spine MRI in patients 
with scoliosis who are scheduled to undergo surgical correction.
METHODS: A total of 378 consecutive patients with presumed AIS who were admitted 
for spinal surgery were examined for neural axis abnormalities using MRI. To 
differentiate patients with normal and abnormal MRI findings, the following 
clinical parameters were evaluated: age, sex, menarcheal status, rotation angle 
(using a scoliometer), coronal balance, shoulder height difference, and low back 
pain. We radiographically evaluated curve type, thoracic or thoracolumbar curve 
direction, curve magnitude and flexibility, apical vertebral rotation, curve 
length, coronal balance, sagittal balance, shoulder height difference, thoracic 
kyphosis, and the Risser sign.
RESULTS: Neural axis abnormalities were detected in 24 patients (6.3%). Abnormal 
MRI findings were significantly more common in males than in females and were 
associated with increased thoracic kyphosis. However, there were no significant 
differences in terms of the other measured parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the patients with presumed AIS who received preoperative 
whole-spine MRI, 6.3% had neural axis abnormalities. Males and patients with 
increased thoracic kyphosis were at a higher risk.

The Stickler syndrome (SS) has been described as a "hereditary progressive 
arthro-ophtalmopathy" by Stickler in 1965, due to mutations on the collagen 
genes. Currently about 40 different genes have been identified which encode for 
at least 27 different collagens. The majority of mutations occur in the COL2A1 
gene on chromosome 12q13 (SS type I). Mutations in COL11A1 are less frequent (SS 
type II). More recently, mutations in COL11A2 and in the COL9A1 gene have been 
reported with particular phenotypes. The main features of this autosomal 
inherited disease are ocular, auditory with orofacial abnormalities and 
early-onset osteoarthritis. We report the clinical presentation of an adult and 
his son, with a particular focus on the bone status of the father, radiography, 
bone densitometry and transiliac bone biopsy showing that he was suffering from 
osteoporosis. The lumbar bone mineral density was low with a Z-score at -2.9. 
Transiliac bone biopsy showed a dramatic decrease of trabecular bone volume 
(8.6%; Nl: 19.5±4.9%), thin trabeculae and a disorganized trabecular network. A 
slight increase of osteoid parameters was observed. Bone resorption was markedly 
increased with an excessive number of active (TRAcP+) osteoclasts. The cortical 
width was normal, but a slight increase of cortical porosity was found. 
Osteoporosis has been rarely described in the SS. It might be useful to 
systematically perform a bone densitometry in all patients with SS and to 
discuss the indication of a transiliac bone biopsy in severe cases.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to identify whether factors beyond 
anatomical abnormalities are associated with low back pain (LBP) and LBP with 
sciatica (SCI) in older men.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mister Osteoporosis Sweden includes 3,014 men aged 69–81 
years. They answered questionnaires on lifestyle and whether they had 
experienced LBP and SCI during the preceding 12 months. About 3,007 men answered 
the back pain (BP) questions, 258 reported BP without specified region. We 
identified 1,388 with no BP, 1,361 with any LBP (regardless of SCI), 1,074 of 
those with LBP also indicated if they had experienced LBP (n = 615), LBP+SCI (n 
= 459).
RESULTS: About 49% of those with LBP and 54% of those with LBP+SCI rated their 
health as poor/very poor (P < 0.001). Men with any LBP to a greater extent than 
those without BP had poor self-estimated health, depressive symptoms, dizziness, 
fall tendency, serious comorbidity (diabetes, stroke, coronary heart disease, 
pulmonary disease and/or cancer) (all P < 0.001), foreign background, were 
smokers (all P < 0.01), had low physical activity and used walking aids (all P < 
0.05). Men with LBP+SCI to a greater extent than those with LBP had lower 
education, lower self-estimated health, comorbidity, dizziness and used walking 
aids (all P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In older men with LBP and SCI, anatomical abnormalities such as 
vertebral fractures, metastases, central or lateral spinal stenosis or 
degenerative conditions may only in part explain prevalent symptoms and 
disability. Social and lifestyle factors must also be evaluated since they are 
associated not only with unspecific LBP but also with LBP with SCI.

Congenital hypoplasia of the lumbar pedicle with spondylolisthesis: report of 2 
cases.

[No authors listed]

Congenital hypoplasia of the spinal pedicle is a rare condition. Previously 
reported cases were treated conservatively or with posterior instrumented 
fusion. However, the absence or hypoplasia of the lumbar pedicle may increase 
the difficulty of pedicle screw fixation and fusion. Herein, the authors 
describe 2 cases of rare adult congenital hypoplasia of the right lumbar 
pedicles associated with spondylolisthesis. The patients underwent anterior 
lumbar interbody fusion with a stand-alone cage as well as percutaneous pedicle 
screw fixation. This method was used to avoid the difficulties associated with 
pedicle screw fixation and to attain solid fusion. Both patients achieved 
satisfactory outcomes after a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. This method may 
be an alternative for patients with congenital hypoplasia of the lumbar spinal 
pedicle.

Several studies have described the radiographic, histological, and morphological 
changes to the paraspinal muscle in patients with chronic low-back pain due to 
degenerative diseases of the spine. Gross anatomical illustrations have shown 
that the psoas muscle lies lateral to the L4-5 vertebrae and subsequently thins 
and dissociates from the vertebral body at L5-S1 in a ventrolateral course. A 
"rising psoas" may influence the location of the lumbar plexus and result in 
transient neurological injury on lateral approach to the spine. It is postulated 
that axial back pain may be exacerbated by anatomical changes of paraspinal 
musculature as a direct result of degenerative spine conditions. To their 
knowledge, the authors present the first reported case of a more anteriorly 
positioned psoas muscle and its resolution following correction of 
spondylolisthesis in a 62-year-old woman. This case highlights the dynamic 
nature of degenerative spinal disorders and illustrates that psoas muscle 
position can be affected by sagittal balance. Normal anatomical positioning can 
be restored following correction of spinal alignment.

This study aims to characterize the psychological wellbeing of chronic headache 
(CH) patients, to identify cortical structural abnormalities and any 
associations of those abnormalities with resting state functional connectivity 
(rsFC), and to determine whether such rsFC abnormality is specific to CH 
patients. Compared with healthy controls (CONCH ), CH patients suffered from 
mild depression, sleep disturbances, and relatively poor quality of life. CH 
patients also exhibited widespread cortical thickness (CT) abnormalities in left 
premotor (BA6), right primary somatosensory (S1) and right prefrontal (BA10) 
cortices, as well as in regions of default mode and executive control networks. 
Using cortical regions with thickness abnormality as seeds, we found cortical 
region pairs showed strengthened rsFC in CH patients. Using the same seeds, rsFC 
analysis from chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients and their controls (CONCLBP 
) identified abnormalities in non-overlapping cortical region pairs. Direct 
comparison of rsFC between CH and CLBP patients revealed significantly 
differences in thirteen cortical region pairs, including the four identified in 
CH and CONCH comparison. Across all three groups (CH, CLBP and CON), the rsFC 
between left multisensory association area (BA39) and left posterior cingulate 
cortex (BA23) differed significantly. Eight regions showed CT abnormality in 
CLBP patients, two of which overlapped with those of CH patients. Our 
observations support the notion that CH and CLBP pain are pathological 
conditions, under which the brain develops distinct widespread structural and 
functional abnormalities. CH and CLBP groups share some similar structural 
abnormalities, but rsFC abnormalities in several cortical region pairs appear to 
be pathology-specific. Hum Brain Mapp 38:1815-1832, 2017. © 2017 Wiley

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between abnormalities in spinal 
morphology and non-specific back pain among adolescents.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Junior and senior high schools.
PATIENTS: Participants were screened using a questionnaire regarding back pain. 
Students in the pain group (n= 273, 121 boys and 152 girls) reported 
experiencing upper and/or lower back pain within the previous month, and those 
who did not report pain were assigned to the group without pain (n= 127, 63 boys 
and 64 girls). Participants who had experienced acute upper and/or lower back 
injuries within the previous month or received a definitive diagnose of disease 
were excluded.
METHODS: The SpinalMouse® was used to measure the thoracic kyphosis angle (TKA), 
lumbar lordosis angle (LLA), sacrum/hip angle (SA), and incline angle (INA) in 
both the standing position and sitting position. The SpinalMouse® also was used 
to measure the sacral, thoracic, and lumbar range of motion (ROM) in the fully 
flexed position and fully extended position in the sagittal plane. The thoracic 
and lumbar ROM in left/right lateral flexion was recorded. The Matthiass test 
was used to assess changes in the measured angles upon loading.
RESULTS: Among junior high school students, 47.0% of boys and 53% of girls had 
an abnormal TKA. Among senior high school students, 52.6% of boys and 46.99% of 
girls had an abnormal TKA. The incidence of LLA abnormality was significantly 
higher among junior high boys than girls (p< 0.05), as was the incidence of 
hypolordosis (p< 0.05). Significantly fewer senior high boys than girls had a 
normal LLA value (p< 0.05). An excessive TKA (p< 0.05, odds ratio = 1.236) and 
limited lumbar ROM (p< 0.01, odds ratio = 0.975) were correlated with back pain 
in adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of TKA and LLA abnormality are high among Chinese 
adolescents, and an excessive TKA and insufficient total lumbar ROM may be risk 
factors for non-specific back pain in adolescents.

Chronic musculoskeletal pain condition often shows poor correlations between 
tissue abnormalities and clinical pain. Therefore, classification of pain 
conditions like chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia depends 
mostly on self report and less on objective findings like X-ray or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) changes. However, recent advances in structural and 
functional brain imaging have identified brain abnormalities in chronic pain 
conditions that can be used for illness classification. Because the analysis of 
complex and multivariate brain imaging data is challenging, machine learning 
techniques have been increasingly utilized for this purpose. The goal of machine 
learning is to train specific classifiers to best identify variables of interest 
on brain MRIs (i.e., biomarkers). This report describes classification 
techniques capable of separating MRI-based brain biomarkers of chronic pain 
patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (70-92%) using machine 
learning, as well as critical scientific, practical, and ethical considerations 
related to their potential clinical application. Although self-report remains 
the gold standard for pain assessment, machine learning may aid in the 
classification of chronic pain disorders like chronic back pain and fibromyalgia 
as well as provide mechanistic information regarding their neural correlates.

BACKGROUND: In patients with diabetes mellitus, epidural steroid injections 
(ESI) have been noted to cause significant elevation of blood glucose levels, 
typically lasting 1-3 days. Here, we describe a previously unreported 
complication of a diabetic third nerve palsy associated with an ESI.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, 
hypertension, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus presented with low back 
pain and left lower extremity radiculopathy. The lumbar magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) revealed mild spondylosis, most severe at the L4-5 level, 
accompanied by a broad based disc protrusion resulting in mild central and 
moderate biforaminal stenosis. The patient underwent a left-sided L4-L5 
transforaminal ESI resulting in transient elevation of his blood glucose levels. 
On post-procedure day 2, he developed a frontal headache and a complete right 
third nerve palsy with partial pupillary involvement. The MRI and MR angiography 
(MRA) of the brain revealed no compressive lesions or oculomotor abnormalities. 
Ophthalmoplegia and pupillary dysfunction resolved spontaneously over 4 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, a history of a recent ESI should be considered as 
the etiology of an isolated oculomotor palsy in diabetic patients.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of abdominal 
hollowing (AH) and abdominal bracing (AB) maneuvers on the activity pattern of 
lumbopelvic muscles during prone hip extension (PHE) in participants with or 
without nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP).
METHODS: Twenty women with or without CLBP participated in this cross-sectional 
observational study. The electromyographic activity (amplitude and onset time) 
of the contralateral erector spinae (CES), ipsilateral erector spinae (IES), 
gluteus maximus, and biceps femoris muscles was measured during PHE with and 
without abdominal maneuvers. A 3-way mixed model analysis of variance and post 
hoc tests were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Between-group comparisons showed that the CES onset delay during PHE 
alone was greater (P = .03) and the activity level of IES, CES, and biceps 
femoris in all maneuvers (P < .05) was higher in patients with CLBP than in 
asymptomatic participants. In asymptomatic participants, PHE + AH significantly 
decreased the signal amplitude (AMP) of IES (P = .01) and CES (P = .02) muscles. 
In participants with CLBP, IES muscle AMP was lower during PHE + AH compared 
with PHE + AB and PHE alone. With regard to onset delay, the results also showed 
no significant difference between maneuvers within either of the 2 groups (P > 
.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Performance of the AH maneuver decreased the erector spinae muscle 
AMP in both groups, and neither maneuver altered the onset delay of any of the 
muscles in either group. The low back pain group showed higher levels of 
activity in all muscles (not statistically significant in gluteus maximus during 
all maneuvers). The groups were similar according to the onset delay of any of 
the muscles during either maneuver.

Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) creates health benefits for some while for 
others, no benefit or even adverse events. Understanding these differential 
responses is important to optimize patient care and safety. Toward this, 
characterizing how loads created by SMT relate to those created by typical 
motions is fundamental. Using robotic testing, it is now possible to make these 
comparisons to determine if SMT generates unique loading scenarios. In 12 
porcine cadavers, SMT and passive motions were applied to the L3/L4 segment and 
the resulting kinematics tracked. The L3/L4 segment was removed, mounted in a 
parallel robot and kinematics of SMT and passive movements replayed robotically. 
The resulting forces experienced by L3/L4 were collected. Overall, SMT created 
both significantly greater and smaller loads compared to passive motions, with 
SMT generating greater anterioposterior peak force (the direction of force 
application) compared to all passive motions. In some comparisons, SMT did not 
create significantly different loads in the intact specimen, but did so in 
specific spinal tissues. Despite methodological differences between studies, SMT 
forces and loading rates fell below published injury values. Future studies are 
warranted to understand if loading scenarios unique to SMT confer its 
differential therapeutic effects.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether transitional 
vertebrae contribute to the development of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The 
prevalence of transitional vertebrae in patients with lumbar pain was determined 
during this process, and the prevalence of sacroiliac dysfunction was compared 
between patients with low back pain and healthy volunteers.
METHODS: 700 subjects, 500 with low back pain and 200 healthy volunteers were 
included in this study. Five tests were applied to all participants to determine 
sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Positivity in three tests was regarded as 
dysfunction. Lateral lumbosacral and Ferguson angle X-rays were taken from the 
group with low back pain. The patient was evaluated a specialist radiologist in 
terms of presence or absence of transitional vertebrae, and if identified, what 
type.
RESULTS: Transitional vertebrae were determined in 26% (n = 130) of the patients 
with low back pain. Type 1a was determined in 20%, type 1b in 10%, type 2a in 
26.9%, type 2b in 30.8%, type 3a in 0.8%, type 3b in 4.6% and type 4 in 6.9%. 
The prevalence of sacroiliac joint dysfunction in the low back pain group 
(15.4%) and the prevalence of sacroiliac joint dysfunction in cases of 
transitional vertebra (28.5%) were significantly higher compared to the control 
groups (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction must be considered when investigating 
the etiology of low back pain. Particular sensitivity must be exhibited on this 
subject in patients with transitional vertebrae.

BACKGROUND: A cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) cavity within the conus medullaris has 
been described by the term ventriculus terminalis (VT) or the fifth ventricle. 
The finding of a VT on MRI imaging of the lumbar spine is often incidental but 
may be found in patients with low back pain or neuromuscular deficits. These 
lesions, when identified, are thought to regress or remain stable in terms of 
size, although some have been described to enlarge in the presence of 
post-traumatic meningeal hemorrhages or deformities of the vertebral canal.
CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a slowly growing VT in a patient with 
progressing lower limb weakness without any history or imaging findings of 
trauma or spinal canal abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: We present an intriguing case of a slowly growing VT in a woman 
with progressive neurological symptoms. Surgical fenestration provided complete 
symptomatic relief and follow-up imaging two years after surgery demonstrated no 
evidence of recurrence. This, to our knowledge, is the first described case of a 
slowly enlarging VT independent of any other imaging findings.

Our objective was to describe the yield of actionable thoracic spine lesions for 
a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol including evaluation of the 
thoracic spine among patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with 
symptoms consistent with epidural compression syndrome. Our ED and Department of 
Radiology together designed a novel rapid MRI protocol entailing 3D volumetric 
T2 weighted sequences through both the thoracic and lumbar spine obtained in the 
sagittal plane to assess for both lumbar and thoracic spine lesions. We recorded 
study outcomes for all patients undergoing this protocol or conventional lumbar 
MRI during May 2014-May 2015 to determine the prevalence of actionable thoracic 
spine lesions. We defined an actionable thoracic lesion as any pathology 
requiring treatment (e.g., medication, admission, surgery) not otherwise 
indicated on the basis of lumbar spine findings. During the study period, 112 of 
124 (90.3%) of ED patients undergoing MRI evaluation for epidural compression 
syndrome underwent the novel protocol. The remaining patients underwent 
evaluation of the lumbar spine using only a conventional MRI protocol. Of the 
112 patients undergoing the novel protocol, 6 (5.4%) patients had thoracic spine 
lesions indicating therapy not otherwise indicated by lumbar spine findings. The 
etiologies of these six lesions were: neoplasms (2), de-myelination (2), 
compression fracture (1), and degeneration due to pernicious anemia (1). 
Emergency providers should strongly consider the routine use of MRI protocols 
including thoracic spine evaluation in patients presenting to the ED with 
symptoms consistent with epidural compression syndrome.

Back pain brings about one of the heaviest burden of disease. Despite much 
research, this condition remains poorly understood, and effective treatments are 
frustratingly elusive. Thus, researchers in the field need to consider new 
hypotheses. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential cofactor for collagen 
crosslinks, a key determinant of ligament, tendon, and bone quality. Recent 
studies have reported high frequency of hypovitaminosis C in the general 
population. We hypothesized that lack of vitamin C contributes to poor collagen 
properties and back pain. We conducted this study to examine the associations 
between serum concentration of vitamin C and the prevalence of spinal pain and 
related functional limitations in the adult general population. This study used 
nationwide cross-sectional data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004. Data were available for 4742 individuals 
aged ≥20 years. Suboptimal serum vitamin C concentrations were associated with 
the prevalence of neck pain (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.5; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.2-2.0), low back pain (aOR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.6), and low back 
pain with pain below knee (aOR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.9) in the past 3 months, 
self-reported diagnosis of arthritis/rheumatism (aOR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.7), and 
related functional limitations' score (adjusted difference of means [aB]: 0.03; 
95% CI: 0.00-0.05). The prevalence of hypovitaminosis C in the general 
population is high. Our study shows associations between vitamin C and spinal 
pain that warrant further investigation to determine the possible importance of 
vitamin C in the treatment of back pain patients.

BACKGROUND: Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine is common, with severe 
disease increasing the risk for chronic low back pain. This cross-sectional 
study examined whether disc degeneration is representative of a 'whole-organ' 
pathology, by examining its association with bone (vertebral endplate) and soft 
tissue (paraspinal muscle fat) abnormalities.
METHODS: Seventy-two community-based individuals unselected for low back pain, 
had Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Lumbosacral disc degeneration was 
determined via the Pfirrmann grading system, a validated method to assess the 
intervertebral disc, distinguishing the nucleus and annulus, the signal 
intensity and the height of the intervertebral disc. Modic change and high 
paraspinal muscle fat content was also measured from MRI.
RESULTS: Severe disc degeneration was associated, or tended to be associated 
with type 2 Modic change from L2 to L5 (OR range 3.5 to 25.3, p ≤ 0.06). 
Moreover, severe disc degeneration at all intervertebral levels was associated 
with or tended to be associated with high fat content of the paraspinal muscles 
(OR range 3.7 to 14.3, p ≤ 0.09).
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that disc degeneration of the lumbar spine is 
commonly accompanied by Modic change and high fat content of paraspinal muscles, 
thus representing a 'whole-organ' pathology. Longitudinal studies are required 
to determine the temporal relationship between these structural abnormalities. 
Understanding this may have the potential to identify novel targets for the 
treatment and prevention of lumbosacral disc degeneration.

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) was shown to be associated with longer reflex 
response latencies of trunk muscles during external upper limb perturbations. 
One theoretical, but rarely investigated possibility for longer reflex latencies 
might be related to modulated somatosensory information processing. Therefore, 
the present study investigated somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to median 
nerve stimulation in CLBP patients and healthy controls (HC). Latencies of the 
peripheral N9 SEP component were used as the primary outcome. In addition, 
latencies and amplitudes of the central N20 SEP component, sensory thresholds, 
motor thresholds and nerve conduction velocity were also analyzed in CLBP 
patients and HC. There is a trend for the CLBP patients to exhibit longer N9 
latencies at the ipsilateral Erb's point compared to HC. This trend is 
substantiated by significantly longer N9 latencies in CLBP patients compared to 
normative data. None of the other parameters showed any significant difference 
between CLBP patients and HC. Overall, our data indicate small differences of 
the peripheral N9 SEP component; however, these differences cannot explain the 
reflex delay observed in CLBP patients. While it was important to rule out the 
contribution of early somatosensory processing and to elucidate its contribution 
to the delayed reflex responses in CLBP patients, further research is needed to 
find the primary source(s) of time-delayed reflexes in CLBP.

Duplicated filum terminale in non-split cord malformations: An underrecognized 
cause for treatment failure in tethered cord syndrome.

CONTEXT: Anatomical variations of the filum terminale (FT) have been described 
in association with split cord malformations (SCM) but they appear to be a rare 
finding in its absence. We report the first case in literature of a duplicated 
FT in a patient presenting with tethered cord syndrome (TCS) without any 
radiological evidence of SCM.
FINDINGS: A 47-year-old man presented with invalidating back pain radiating to 
both legs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural dorsal lipoma in a 
low-lying conus. Intraoperatively two distinct fibrous bands were anatomically 
and electrophysiologically identified as the FT and both were sectioned. The 
diagnosis of FT was confirmed for both specimens by histology.
CONCLUSION: In absence of SCM, a duplicated FT has not been previously described 
as a cause of TCS. It may be a cause of treatment failure for TCS if 
unrecognized on preoperative imaging and during surgery if one filum remains 
intact. We highlight the importance of a meticulous cauda equina dissection 
supported by intraoperative nerve stimulation to identify this rare anomaly. We 
hypothesize that this entity may represent a variant of SCM involving the caudal 
neural tube but which requires further validation at an embryological level.

We conducted a systematic review of guidelines on the management of low back 
pain (LBP) to assess their methodological quality and guide care. We synthesized 
guidelines on the management of LBP published from 2005 to 2014 following best 
evidence synthesis principles. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, 
Cochrane, DARE, National Health Services Economic Evaluation Database, Health 
Technology Assessment Database, Index to Chiropractic Literature and grey 
literature. Independent reviewers critically appraised eligible guidelines using 
AGREE II criteria. We screened 2504 citations; 13 guidelines were eligible for 
critical appraisal, and 10 had a low risk of bias. According to high-quality 
guidelines: (1) all patients with acute or chronic LBP should receive education, 
reassurance and instruction on self-management options; (2) patients with acute 
LBP should be encouraged to return to activity and may benefit from paracetamol, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or spinal manipulation; (3) the 
management of chronic LBP may include exercise, paracetamol or NSAIDs, manual 
therapy, acupuncture, and multimodal rehabilitation (combined physical and 
psychological treatment); and (4) patients with lumbar disc herniation with 
radiculopathy may benefit from spinal manipulation. Ten guidelines were of high 
methodological quality, but updating and some methodological improvements are 
needed. Overall, most guidelines target nonspecific LBP and recommend education, 
staying active/exercise, manual therapy, and paracetamol or NSAIDs as first-line 
treatments. The recommendation to use paracetamol for acute LBP is challenged by 
recent evidence and needs to be revisited.
SIGNIFICANCE: Most high-quality guidelines recommend education, staying 
active/exercise, manual therapy and paracetamol/NSAIDs as first-line treatments 
for LBP. Recommendation of paracetamol for acute LBP is challenged by recent 
evidence and needs updating.

Back schools are interventions that comprise exercise and education components. 
We aimed to systematically review the randomized controlled trial evidence on 
back schools for the treatment of chronic low back pain. By searching MEDLINE, 
Embase, and Cochrane Central as well as bibliographies, we identified 31 studies 
for inclusion in our systematic review and 5 of these for inclusion in 
meta-analyses. Meta-analyses for pain scores and functional outcomes revealed 
statistical superiority of back schools vs no intervention for some comparisons 
but not others. No meta-analysis was feasible for the comparison of back schools 
vs other active treatments. Adverse events were poorly reported so that no 
reliable conclusions regarding the safety of back schools can be drawn, although 
some limited reassurance in this regard may be derived from the fact that few 
adverse events and no serious adverse events were reported in the back school 
groups in the studies that did report on safety. Overall, the evidence base for 
the use of back schools to treat chronic low back pain is weak; in nearly a 
half-century since back schools were first trialled, no unequivocal evidence of 
benefit has emerged.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether seemingly healthy first-degree relatives of 
patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have clinical, laboratory, or imaging 
features of spondyloarthritis (SpA).
METHODS: First-degree relatives (ages 18-40 years) of HLA-B27-positive AS 
patients were included in the pre-spondyloarthritis (Pre-SpA) cohort, a 
prospective inception cohort study. Clinical, biologic, and imaging features 
were recorded. First-degree relatives were classified according to several sets 
of SpA classification criteria.
RESULTS: We report baseline features of 51 first-degree relatives included in 
this study. Twenty-nine (57%) had back pain, 2 (4%) had psoriasis, 1 (2%) had 
inflammatory bowel disease, and 1 (2%) had uveitis. Three (6%) had low-grade 
sacroiliitis, 1 (2%) had cervical syndesmophytes on radiography, and 10 (20%) 
had bone marrow edema on magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliiac joints. 
Seventeen of 51 first-degree relatives (33%) fulfilled SpA classification 
criteria: 7 (14%) fulfilled both Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international 
Society (ASAS) axial SpA and European Spondylarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) 
classification criteria, 6 (12%) fulfilled only ASAS axial SpA classification 
criteria, and 4 (8%) fulfilled only ESSG classification criteria; 3 (6%) also 
fulfilled the Amor criteria. None fulfilled other SpA classification criteria. 
First-degree relatives fulfilling the ASAS axial SpA and/or ESSG classification 
criteria had more frequent inflammatory back pain, had a higher level of disease 
activity, and had more psoriasis. No differences were found in parameters of 
inflammation, peripheral and extraarticular disease other than psoriasis, and 
HLA-B27 positivity between those who did and those who did not fulfill the ASAS 
axial SpA and/or ESSG classification criteria. Four first-degree relatives (12%) 
who did not fulfill the ASAS axial SpA and/or ESSG classification criteria had 
imaging abnormalities suggestive of SpA.
CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of seemingly healthy first-degree relatives 
of HLA-B27-positive AS patients have clinical and/or imaging abnormalities 
suggestive of SpA. Thirty-three percent could be classified as having SpA. 
Further follow-up will show which first-degree relatives will develop clinically 
manifest SpA.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a propensity to metastasize to the liver, lungs and 
regional abdominal lymph nodes, but rarely to the bone marrow. A 60-year-old man 
presented to the National Hospital Organization Kyushu Cancer Center with a 
4-week history of persistent lower back pain, anorexia and difficulty 
defecating. Complete blood count revealed severe thrombocytopenia and 
erythroblastosis, suggesting a hematological malignancy. However, the bone 
marrow examination demonstrated involvement by a moderately to poorly 
differentiated adenocarcinoma, but no hematopoietic abnormalities. A computed 
tomography scan revealed thickening of the wall of the sigmoid colon, with 
para-aortic, hilar, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The patient 
was thus diagnosed with sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma with lymph node and bone 
marrow metastasis. Modified FOLFOX6 was promptly initiated, with concurrent 
therapy for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). An increased number of 
thrombocytes was observed on day 6. After 3 cycles of treatment, the patient 
recovered from DIC and the levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen and 
cytokeratin 19 fragment were decreased. Tumor biopsy during colonoscopy 
following recovery from DIC demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma 
with mucin production, without mutations in the RAS, BRAF or PIK3CA genes, and a 
cytokeratin (CK) 7-negative, CK20-positive phenotype. The patient has been 
treated with chemotherapy for 150 days without disease progression. However, the 
efficacy of chemotherapy for rarely encountered bone marrow metastasis from CRC 
is poor. The present case was favorably maintained on chemotherapy and survived 
for 10 months.

PURPOSE: This report compares the clinical, radiographic, and functional 
outcomes of fusion from thoracolumbar region terminating at L5 or at sacrum and 
pelvis in elderly patients with spinal deformity.
METHODS: Ninety-four elderly patients who underwent spinal deformity surgery at 
our institution were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups. The group 
L included 43 patients who underwent fusion of lumbar curve from thoracolumbar 
region to L5. The group P consisted of 51 patients who were treated using fusion 
from lower thoracic region to S1 extending to the pelvis. Radiographic outcomes, 
health-related to the quality of life (HRQOL) parameters, and complications with 
a 3-year minimum follow-up were analyzed and compared between two groups.
RESULTS: In the group L, the ideal sagittal balance was not achieved. The group 
P showed a better restoration of global spinal alignments compared with the 
group L. The HRQOL scores (VAS, ODI, SRS-24) of the patients after 3 years are 
slightly higher in the group P, but we did not get significant difference 
between groups. The total number of complications was higher in the group P.
CONCLUSIONS: The research showed that fusion of lumbar curve extending to the 
pelvis provided good sagittal balance, global spinal alignments, and likely 
HRQOL parameters after 3-year follow-up. But, eventually, we obtained higher 
number of complications.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar muscle dysfunction due to pain might be related to altered 
lumbar muscle structure. Macroscopically, muscle degeneration in low back pain 
(LBP) is characterized by a decrease in cross-sectional area and an increase in 
fat infiltration in the lumbar paraspinal muscles. In addition microscopic 
changes, such as changes in fiber distribution, might occur. Inconsistencies in 
results from different studies make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on 
which structural changes are present in the different types of non-specific LBP. 
Insights regarding structural muscle alterations in LBP are, however, important 
for prevention and treatment of non-specific LBP.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article is to review which macro- and/or microscopic 
structural alterations of the lumbar muscles occur in case of non-specific 
chronic low back pain (CLBP), recurrent low back pain (RLBP), and acute low back 
pain (ALBP).
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
SETTING: All selected studies were case-control studies.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed 
and Web of Science. Only full texts of original studies regarding structural 
alterations (atrophy, fat infiltration, and fiber type distribution) in lumbar 
muscles of patients with non-specific LBP compared to healthy controls were 
included. All included articles were scored on methodological quality.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were found eligible after screening title, abstract, 
and full text for inclusion and exclusion criteria. In CLBP, moderate evidence 
of atrophy was found in the multifidus; whereas, results in the paraspinal and 
the erector spinae muscle remain inconclusive. Also moderate evidence occurred 
in RLBP and ALBP, where no atrophy was shown in any lumbar muscle. Conflicting 
results were seen in undefined LBP groups. Results concerning fat infiltration 
were inconsistent in CLBP. On the other hand, there is moderate evidence in RLBP 
that fat infiltration does not occur, although a larger muscle fat index was 
found in the erector spinae, multifidus, and paraspinal muscles, reflecting an 
increased relative amount of intramuscular lipids in RLBP. However, no studies 
were found investigating fat infiltration in ALBP. Restricted evidence indicates 
no abnormalities in fiber type in the paraspinal muscles in CLBP. No studies 
have examined fiber type in ALBP and RLBP.
LIMITATIONS: Lack of clarity concerning patient definitions, exact LBP symptoms, 
and applied methods.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate atrophy in CLBP in the multifidus and 
paraspinal muscles but not in the erector spinae. No atrophy was shown in RLBP 
and ALBP. Fat infiltration did not occur in RLBP, but results in CLBP were 
inconsistent. No abnormalities in fiber type in the paraspinal muscles were 
found in CLBP.
KEY WORDS: Low back pain, non-specific, chronic, recurrent, acute, muscle 
structure, fat infiltration, cross-sectional area, fiber type, review.

BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain due to disc degeneration represents a major 
social and economic burden worldwide. The current standard of care is limited to 
symptomatic relief and no current approved therapy promotes disc regeneration. 
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are easily accessible and well 
characterized. These MSCs are multipotent and exhibit great tissue regenerative 
potential including bone, cartilage, and fibrous tissue regeneration. The use of 
this cell-based biologic for treating protruding disc herniation and/or 
intervertebral disc degeneration is a promising therapeutic strategy, due to 
their known regenerative, immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.
METHODS: Five patients diagnosed with degenerative disc disease received an 
intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic cultured, bone marrow-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (15.1-51.6 million cells) as part of a previous study. 
These patients were re-consented to participate in this study in order to assess 
long-term safety and feasibility of intra-discal injection of autologous, 
hypoxic cultured, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 4-6 years post 
mesenchymal stem cell infusion. The follow-up study consisted of a physical 
examination, a low back MRI, and a quality of life questionnaire.
RESULTS: Patients' lower back MRI showed absence of neoplasms or abnormalities 
surrounding the treated region. Based on the physical examination and the 
quality of life questionnaire, no adverse events were reported due to the 
procedure or to the stem cell treatment 4-6 years post autologous, hypoxic 
cultured mesenchymal stem cell infusion. All patients self-reported overall 
improvement, as well as improvement in strength, post stem cell treatment, and 
four out of five patients reported improvement in mobility.
CONCLUSION: This early human clinical data suggests the safety and feasibility 
of the clinical use of hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem 
cells for the treatment of lower back pain due to degenerative disc disorders 
and support further studies utilizing hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived stem 
cells. The overall improvements reported are encouraging, but a larger 
double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical study with significant number of 
patients and implementation of validated endpoint measurements are next steps in 
order to demonstrate efficacy of this cell-based biologic.

Purpose To explore supervisors' perspectives and decision-making processes in 
the accommodation of back injured workers. Methods Twenty-three semi-structured, 
in-depth interviews were conducted with supervisors from eleven Canadian 
organizations about their role in providing job accommodations. Supervisors were 
identified through an on-line survey and interviews were recorded, transcribed 
and entered into NVivo software. The initial analyses identified common units of 
meaning, which were used to develop a coding guide. Interviews were coded, and a 
model of supervisor decision-making was developed based on the themes, 
categories and connecting ideas identified in the data. Results The 
decision-making model includes a process element that is described as iterative 
"trial and error" decision-making. Medical restrictions are compared to job 
demands, employee abilities and available alternatives. A feasible modification 
is identified through brainstorming and then implemented by the supervisor. 
Resources used for brainstorming include information, supervisor experience and 
autonomy, and organizational supports. The model also incorporates the 
experience of accommodation as a job demand that causes strain for the 
supervisor. Accommodation demands affect the supervisor's attitude, 
brainstorming and monitoring effort, and communication with returning employees. 
Resources and demands have a combined effect on accommodation decision 
complexity, which in turn affects the quality of the accommodation option 
selected. If the employee is unable to complete the tasks or is reinjured during 
the accommodation, the decision cycle repeats. More frequent iteration through 
the trial and error process reduces the likelihood of return to work success. 
Conclusion A series of propositions is developed to illustrate the relationships 
among categories in the model. The model and propositions show: (a) the 
iterative, problem solving nature of the RTW process; (b) decision resources 
necessary for accommodation planning, and

(c) the impact accommodation demands may have on supervisors and RTW quality.

NOVOCART® Disk plus, an autologous cell compound for autologous disk chondrocyte 
transplantation, was developed to reduce the degenerative sequel after lumbar 
disk surgery or to prophylactically avoid degeneration in adjacent disks, if 
present. The NDisc trial is an ongoing multi-center, randomized study with a 
sequential phase I study within the combined phase I/II trial with close 
monitoring of tolerability and safety. Twenty-four adult patients were 
randomized and treated with the investigational medicinal product NDisc plus or 
the carrier material only. Rates of adverse events in Phase I of this trial were 
comparable with those expected in the early time course after elective disk 
surgery. There was one reherniation 7 months after transplantation, which 
corresponds to an expected reherniation rate. Immunological markers like CRP and 
IL-6 were not significantly elevated and there were no imaging abnormalities. No 
indications of harmful material extrusion or immunological consequences due to 
the investigational medicinal product NDplus were observed. Therefore, the study 
appears to be safe and feasible. Safety analyses of Phase I of this trial 
indicate a relatively low risk considering the benefits that patients with 
debilitating degenerative disk disease may gain.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the morphometric abnormalities of brain gray matter (GM) 
in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).
METHODS: Thirty patients with CLBP and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled and 
examined with a 3.0 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. High-resolution T1 
structural MR data were acquired and data analysis was performed using 
voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in FMRIB Software Library. The morphological 
differences were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: s Compared with the healthy control subjects, patients with CLBP showed 
decreased GM volumes in several brain cortical areas including the bilateral 
superior frontal gyrus, right frontal pole, left insular cortex, left middle and 
left inferior temporal gyrus (P<0.05, after TFCE correction). Increased GM 
volumes were found in the patients in the subcortical structures including the 
left thalamus, bilateral putamen, bilateral nucleus accumben and right caudate 
nucleus (P<0.05, after TFCE correction).
CONCLUSION: Patients with CLBP have different patterns of GM abnormalities in 
different brain regions, characterized by reduced GM volume in cerebral cortical 
regions and increased GM volume in the subcortical nuclei. Such changes might be 
associated with the maladaptation of the brain in chronic pain state.

The current study examined the relationship between perceived injustice and 
attentional bias (AB) toward pain among individuals with chronic low back pain 
asked to perform and appraise the pain and difficulty of a standardized set of 
common physical activities. A pictorial dot-probe task assessed AB toward pain 
stimuli (ie, pain faces cueing pain), after which participants performed the 
physical tasks. Participants also rated face stimuli in terms of pain, sadness, 
and anger expression. As hypothesized, perceived injustice was positively 
associated with AB toward pain stimuli; additionally, perceived injustice and AB 
were positively associated with appraisals of pain and difficulty. Counter to 
expectations, AB did not mediate the relationship between perceived injustice 
and task appraisals, suggesting that AB is insufficient to explain this 
relationship. Exploratory analyses indicated that participants with higher 
levels of perceived injustice rated stimulus faces as sadder and angrier; no 
such differences emerged for pain ratings. To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to examine the association between perceived injustice and AB toward pain, 
as well as perceived injustice and in vivo appraisals of common physical 
activity. Results extend existing literature and suggest that attentional and 
potential interpretive bias should be considered in future research.
PERSPECTIVE: This article identifies significant associations between perceived 
injustice, biased attention to pain, and appraisals of common physical 
activities among individuals with chronic low back pain. These findings suggest 
targets for intervention as well as directions for future research regarding 
individuals with high perceptions of injustice related to pain.

BACKGROUND: Following lumbar fusion surgery, a successful outcome is empirically 
linked to effective rehabilitation. While rehabilitation is typically 
postoperative, the phase before surgery - termed prehabilitation - is reportedly 
an ideal time to prepare the patient. There are presently no guidelines for 
prehabilitation before lumbar fusion surgery. Physical activity has well-known 
health benefits, and staying physically active despite pain is a major principle 
in non-pharmacological chronic low back pain treatment. Psychological factors 
such as fear of movement, pain catastrophizing and low self-efficacy are known 
to be barriers to staying active. No studies have investigated prehabilitation 
protocols that promote physical activity and target psychological risk factors 
before lumbar fusion surgery. The aim of our proposed randomised controlled 
trial is to investigate whether patients who undergo lumbar fusion surgery for 
degenerative disc disease experience better functioning with a physiotherapeutic 
prehabilitation program (PREPARE) based on a cognitive behavioural approach 
compared to conventional care.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will recruit 110 patients between 18-70 years of age with 
degenerative disc disease who are waiting for lumbar fusion surgery. These 
patients will be randomly assigned to receive either PREPARE or conventional 
care. PREPARE uses a person-centred perspective and focuses on promoting 
physical activity and targeting psychological risk factors before surgery. The 
primary outcome will be disability measured using the Oswestry Disability Index 
2.0. Secondary outcomes will include functioning (patient-reported and 
performance-based), physical activity (accelerometer), health-related quality of 
life, back and leg pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, 
self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, satisfaction with treatment results and 
health economic factors. Data will be collected at baseline (preoperatively) 
after the intervention (preoperatively), 3 and 8 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 
60 months postoperatively.
DISCUSSION: We hypothesise that the focus on promoting physical activity and 
targeting psychological risk factors before surgery will decrease disability and 
help the patients to be more active despite pain both before and after surgery. 
We will use a combination of outcome measures both patient-reported and 
performance-based, as well as accelerometer data. This will provide a more 
comprehensive picture of the patient's functioning than just patient-reported 
outcomes alone.

Sciatica: An Extremely Rare Complication of the Perianal Abscess.

Gujrathi R(1), Gupta K(1), Ravi C(1), Pai B(1).

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Sciatica has been classically described as pain in the back and hip 
with radiation in the leg along the distribution of the sciatic nerve, secondary 
to compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve. Spinal abnormality being the 
most common etiology, is one of the most common indications for MRI of the 
lumbosacral spine. Here we describe imaging findings secondary to a supralevator 
perianal abscess causing irritation of the sciatic nerve, which was diagnosed on 
MRI of the lumbosacral spine.
CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department 
with severe acute pain in the right hip and right leg which was aggravated by 
limb movement. Clinically, a possibility of sciatica was suggested and MRI of 
the lumbosacral spine was ordered. The MRI did not reveal any abnormality in the 
lumbosacral spine; however, on STIR coronal images, a right perianal abscess 
with air pockets was seen. The perianal abscess was extending above the levator 
ani muscle with and was seen tracking along the sciatic nerve, explaining pain 
along the distribution of the sciatic nerve. The abscess was surgically drained, 
followed by an antibiotic course. The patient was symptomatically better 
post-surgery. Post-operative scan done 3 days later revealed significant 
resolution of the infra- and supralevator perianal abscess. The patient was 
discharged from hospital on post-operative day 3 on oral antibiotics for 7 days. 
On 15th post-operative day, the patient was clinically completely asymptomatic 
with good healing of the perianal surgical wound.
CONCLUSIONS: Extra-spinal causes are rare and most often overlooked in patients 
with sciatica. While assessing patients with sciatica, extra-spinal causes for 
the radiation of pain along the distribution of the sciatic nerve should always 
be looked for if abnormalities in the MRI of the lumbar spine are not found. 
Inclusion of STIR sequences in the imaging of the lumbosacral spine, more often 
than not, helps to identify the extra-spinal cause of sciatica when MRI of the 
lumbosacral spine does not reveal any abnormality.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of 
disability worldwide and among the most common reasons for seeking primary 
sector care. Chiropractors, physical therapists and general practitioners are 
among those providers that treat LBP patients, but there is only limited 
evidence regarding the effectiveness and economic evaluation of care offered by 
these provider groups.
PURPOSE: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and to systematically review the 
literature of full economic evaluation of chiropractic care compared to other 
commonly used care approaches among adult patients with non-specific LBP.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic reviews of interventions and economic evaluations.
METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy was conducted to identify 1) pragmatic 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and/or 2) full economic evaluations of 
chiropractic care for low back pain compared to standard care delivered by other 
healthcare providers. Studies published between 1990 and 4th June 2015 were 
considered. Primary outcomes included pain, functional status and global 
improvement. Study selection, critical quality appraisal and data extraction 
were conducted by two independent reviewers. Data from RCTs with low risk of 
bias were included in a meta-analysis to determine effect estimates. Cost 
estimates of full economic evaluations were converted to 2015 USD and results 
summarized using Slavin's qualitative best-evidence synthesis.
RESULTS: Six RCTs and three full economic evaluations were scientifically 
admissible. Five RCTs with low risk of bias compared chiropractic care to 
exercise therapy (n = 1), physical therapy (n = 3) and medical care (n = 1). 
Overall, we found similar effects for chiropractic care and the other types of 
care and no reports of serious adverse events. Three low to high quality full 
economic evaluations studies (one cost-effectiveness, one cost-minimization and 
one cost-benefit) compared chiropractic to medical care. Given the divergent 
conclusions (favours chiropractic, favours medical care, equivalent options), 
mixed-evidence was found for economic evaluations of chiropractic care compared 
to medical care.
CONCLUSION: Moderate evidence suggests that chiropractic care for LBP appears to 
be equally effective as physical therapy. Limited evidence suggests the same 
conclusion when chiropractic care is compared to exercise therapy and medical 
care although no firm conclusion can be reached at this time. No serious adverse 
events were reported for any type of care. Our review was also unable to clarify 
whether chiropractic or medical care is more cost-effective. Given the limited 
available evidence, the decision to seek or to refer patients for chiropractic 
care should be based on patient preference and values. Future studies are likely 
to have an important impact on our estimates as these were based on only a few 
admissible studies.

STUDY DESIGN: Delphi.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain an expert consensus on which 
history factors are most important in the clinical diagnosis of lumbar spinal 
stenosis (LSS).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: LSS is a poorly defined clinical syndrome. Criteria 
for defining LSS are needed and should be informed by the experience of expert 
clinicians.
METHODS: Phase 1 (Delphi Items): 20 members of the International Taskforce on 
the Diagnosis and Management of LSS confirmed a list of 14 history items. An 
online survey was developed that permits specialists to express the logical 
order in which they consider the items, and the level of certainty ascertained 
from the questions. Phase 2 (Delphi Study) Round 1: Survey distributed to 
members of the International Society for the Study of the Lumbar Spine. Round 2: 
Meeting of 9 members of Taskforce where consensus was reached on a final list of 
10 items. Round 3: Final survey was distributed internationally. Phase 3: Final 
Taskforce consensus meeting.
RESULTS: A total of 279 clinicians from 29 different countries, with a mean of 
19 (±SD: 12) years in practice participated. The six top items were "leg or 
buttock pain while walking," "flex forward to relieve symptoms," "feel relief 
when using a shopping cart or bicycle," "motor or sensory disturbance while 
walking," "normal and symmetric foot pulses," "lower extremity weakness," and 
"low back pain." Significant change in certainty ceased after six questions at 
80% (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to reach an international consensus on the 
clinical diagnosis of LSS, and suggests that within six questions clinicians are 
80% certain of diagnosis. We propose a consensus-based set of "seven history 
items" that can act as a pragmatic criterion for defining LSS in both clinical 
and research settings, which in the long term may lead to more cost-effective 
treatment, improved health care utilization, and enhanced patient outcomes.

Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) is a common procedure for patients with 
degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine. In this study, the clinical and 
radiological outcomes of a combination titanium/polyetheretherketone (Ti/PEEK) 
ALIF cages in one, two and three-level surgery were evaluated. Over an 18-month 
time period, a prospective single surgeon series of 20 implants (15 patients) 
were included in the study, with minimum 10-months follow-up. From these 15 
patients, two were supplemented with posterior percutaneous pedicle screw 
fixation for additional stability. Radiological follow-up with fine cut CT scan 
at 9-12months was performed to evaluate early fusion rates, and integration of 
the Titanium/PEEK cage at the endplate junction. 20 implants were followed for a 
minimum of 10months, and a mean of 15months. A 95% (19/20 implants) fusion rate 
with no implant related complications was achieved at the mean 15-month 
postoperative mark. Patients experienced statistically significant improvement 
in pain and functional outcomes (SF12 and ODI) compared to their pre-operative 
status. A single patient with a non-union at L5/S1 (smoker) did not experience 
any improvement in symptoms. A Ti-PEEK cage, with allograft and BMP-2 to achieve 
interbody fusion is an effective implant for use in anterior lumbar surgery with 
high fusion rates, no lucency around the titanium endplates at follow-up, and 
with promising early results.

Calgary, AB, Canada. sgarg@ucalgary.ca.

BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is one of the most common presenting 
complaints to a physician's office. Treatment is often challenging and recovery 
depends on various factors, often resulting in significant investments of time 
and resources.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to determine which Web-based interventions 
aimed at chronic low back pain are of benefit to patients.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying Web-based interventions 
directed at adults with chronic low back pain were included. Retrospective 
studies, narrative reviews, nonrandomized trials, and observational studies were 
excluded. Electronic databases and bibliographies were searched.
RESULTS: In total, nine unique RCTs were identified (total participants=1796). 
The number of patients randomized in each trial ranged from 51 to 580. Four 
trials studied online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and five trials studied 
other Web-based interventions with interactive features. Empowerment/control was 
improved in six studies. Use of CBT was associated with reduced 
catastrophization among patients. Mixed results were reported with regards to 
reduction in pain levels and disability, although some studies showed promise in 
reducing disability in the short term. One study that measured health care 
utilization reported reduced utilization with the use of moderated email 
discussion.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited data are available regarding effective Web-based 
interventions to improve outcomes for patients with chronic low back pain. Nine 
RCTs with small sample sizes were identified in this review. Online CBT appears 
to show some promise in terms of reducing catastrophization and improving 
patient attitudes. Further research in this area with larger-scale studies 
focusing on appropriate outcomes appears to be a priority.

Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is an important tool to detect 
abnormalities of peripheral nerves. This pictorial review demonstrates the MRN 
features of a variety of neuropathies affecting the lumbosacral plexus (LSP) and 
lower extremity nerves, drawn from over 1200 MRNs from our institution and 
supplemented by the literature. Abnormalities can be due to spinal compression, 
extraspinal compression, malignancy, musculoskeletal disease, iatrogenesis, 
inflammation, infection, and idiopathic disorders. We discuss indications and 
limitations of MRN in diagnosing LSP neuropathies. As MRN becomes more widely 
used, physicians must become familiar with the differential diagnosis of 
abnormalities detectable with MRN of the LSP.

Athletes have a higher prevalence of LBP and spinal abnormalities on Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) compared to non-athletes. The objective of this study 
was to investigate the amount of spinal MRI abnormalities and the lifetime 
prevalence of low back pain (LBP) in 16 young elite Mogul skiers compared to 28 
non-athletes in the corresponding age in a cross-sectional design. LBP was 
assessed by a questionnaire consisting of a part regarding previous or present 
back pain, the Oswestry disability index, and the EuroQol questionnaire. MRI 
examinations from Th5 to sacrum were conducted to evaluate spinal pathologies. 
The Mogul skiers had significantly more MRI abnormalities (like disc 
degeneration) in mean (7.25 vs 3.78, P < 0.023) compared to the controls. No 
significant difference was seen regarding the lifetime LBP prevalence between 
the groups (50% vs 42%, P = 0.555). No correlation could be found between disc 
degeneration and back pain in this study. Young elite Mogul skiers, compared to 
an age-matched control group of non-athletes, have an increased risk of 
developing spinal abnormalities potentially due to the different high loads that 
they are subjected to in their sport. Future relationship between the MRI 
abnormalities and LBP cannot be verified by this study design.

BACKGROUND: Far-out syndrome was reported by Wiltse et al. in 1984, which is a 
condition characterized by L5 spinal nerve radiculopathy due to nerve 
compression between the L5 transverse process and sacral alar. Although many 
cases of far-out syndrome have been reported, to our knowledge, the present case 
firstly showed far-out syndrome due to assimilated L4 hemivertebra and L5 
vertebra through which abnormal nerve root passed.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old man presented with left lower back pain and 
intermittent claudication accompanied by severe left buttock pain. Radiological 
examination showed assimilation between the L4 hemivertebra and L5 vertebra, 
which had two pedicles on the right side, with no canal stenosis. However, 
computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of coronal sections showed 
extraforaminal stenosis between the L5 transverse process and sacral alar, 
whereby the L5 spinal nerve was pinched ("far-out lesion"), and an abnormal 
nerve root passage in the assimilated vertebral corpus. We performed 
transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, then resected the L5 transverse process 
to decompress the extraforaminal stenosis, and finally installed pedicle screws, 
but not at the one of pedicles of the assimilated vertebra in order to prevent 
nerve injury. Postoperatively, the patient had no symptoms up to 1.5 years after 
the surgery.
CONCLUSION: The current case suggests the importance of detailed preoperative 
examination of patients with anatomical abnormalities such as assimilated 
vertebrae, which may result in incorrect diagnosis and failed surgery.

PURPOSE: To determine if adolescent athletics increases the risk of structural 
abnormalities in the lumbar spine.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients (ages 10-18) between 2004 and 2012 
was performed. Pediatric patients with symptomatic low back pain, a lumbar spine 
MRI, and reported weekly athletic activity were included. Patients were 
stratified to an "athlete" and "non-athlete" group. Lumbar magnetic resonance 
and plain radiographic imaging was randomized, blinded, and evaluated by two 
authors for a Pfirrmann grade, herniated disc, and/or pars fracture.
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients met the inclusion criteria and were stratified 
into 66 athletes and 48 non-athletes. Athletes were more likely to have abnormal 
findings compared to non-athletes (67 vs. 40 %, respectively, p = 0.01). 
Specifically, the prevalence of a spondylolysis with or without a slip was 
higher in athletes vs. non-athletes (32 vs. 2 %, respectively, p = 0.0003); 
however, there was no difference in the average Pfirrmann grade (1.19 vs. 1.14, 
p = 0.41), percentage of patients with at least one degenerative disc (39 vs. 
31 %, p = 0.41), or disc herniation (27 vs. 33 %, p = 0.43). Body mass index, 
smoking history, and pelvic incidence (51.5° vs. 48.7°, respectively, p = 0.41) 
were similar between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Adolescents with low back pain have a higher-than-expected 
prevalence of structural pathology regardless of athletic activity. Independent 
of pelvic incidence, adolescent athletes with low back pain had a higher 
prevalence of spondylolysis compared to adolescent non-athletes with back pain, 
but there was no difference in associated disc degenerative changes or 
herniation.

PURPOSE: The aim was to elucidate elite swimming's possible influence on lumbar 
disc degeneration (DD) and low back pain (LBP).
METHODS: Lumbar spine MRI was performed on a group of elite swimmers and 
compared to a matched Finnish population-based no-sport group.
RESULTS: One hundred elite swimmers and 96 no-sport adults, mean age 18.7/20.8, 
respectively, participated. Overall, the two groups had similar prevalence of 
DD. Swimmers had more DD in the upper lumbar spine but tended to have less DD at 
the lowest level. Prevalence of bulges and disc herniations were similar, but 
swimmers had significantly more bulges at L4-5. The swimmers reported less LBP, 
although not significantly (N.S.). If degenerative findings were present, the 
association between them and LBP was stronger in the no-sport group.
CONCLUSION: Elite swimmers and controls had similar prevalence of DD and LBP, 
although the pattern of DD differed between the groups. In case of DD, swimmers 
reported less LBP, although N.S.

BACKGROUND: Limited z-axis-coverage computed tomography (CT) to evaluate for 
pediatric lumbar spondylolysis, altering the technique such that the dose to the 
patient is comparable or lower than radiographs, is currently used at our 
institution. The objective of the study was to determine whether volumetric 
3-dimensional fast spin echo magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) can provide 
equal or greater diagnostic accuracy compared with limited CT in the diagnosis 
of pediatric lumbar spondylolysis without ionizing radiation.
HYPOTHESIS: Volumetric 3D MRI can provide equal or greater diagnostic accuracy 
compared with low-dose CT for pediatric lumbar spondylolysis without ionizing 
radiation.
STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2.
METHODS: Three pediatric neuroradiologists evaluated 2-dimensional (2D) MRI, 2D 
+ 3D MRI, and limited CT examinations in 42 pediatric patients who obtained 
imaging for low back pain and suspected spondylolysis. As there is no gold 
standard for the diagnosis of spondylolysis besides surgery, interobserver 
agreement and degree of confidence were compared to determine which modality is 
preferable.
RESULTS: Decreased-dose CT provided a greater level of agreement than 2D MRI and 
2D + 3D MRI. The kappa for rater agreement with 2D MRI, 2D + 3D MRI, and CT was 
0.19, 0.32, and 1.0, respectively. All raters agreed in 31%, 40%, and 100% of 
cases with 2D MRI, 2D + 3D MRI, and CT. Lack of confidence was significantly 
lower with CT (0%) than with 2D MRI (30%) and 2D + 3D MRI (25%).
CONCLUSION: For diagnosing spondylolysis, radiologist agreement and confidence 
trended toward improvement with the addition of a volumetric 3D MRI sequence to 
standard 2D MRI sequences compared with 2D MRI alone; however, agreement and 
confidence remain significantly greater using decreased-dose CT when compared 
with either MRI acquisition.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Decreased-dose CT of the lumbar spine remains the optimal 
examination to confirm a high suspicion of spondylolysis, with dose essentially 
equivalent to radiographs. If clinical symptoms are not classic for 
spondylolysis, 2D MRI is still very good at detecting spondylolysis while 
remaining sensitive for detection of alternative diagnoses such as disc 
abnormalities and pars stress reaction. The data suggest that standard 2D MRI 
sequences should not be entirely replaced by a volumetric T2-weighted 3D 
sequence (despite promising features of rapid acquisition time, increased 
spatial resolution, and reconstruction capability).

STUDY DESIGN: Psychometric evaluation design.
PURPOSE: Psychometric evaluation of a multidisciplinary work-related low back 
pain predictor questionnaire (MWRLBPPQ) of Iranians patient-care workers based 
on the social cognitive theory.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Healthcare is one of the professions in which 
work-related musculoskeletal disorders are prevalent. The chronic low back pain 
experienced by patient caregivers can negatively impact their professional 
performance, and patient handling in a hospital is the main cause of low back 
pain in this population.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Qom, Iran from July 
2014 to November 2014. A MWRLBPPQ based on nine concepts of the social cognitive 
theory and existing literature regarding chronic low back pain was developed. 
Ten patient-care workers first completed the questionnaire as a pilot test, 
allowing the ambiguities of the instrument to be resolved. Exploratory factor 
analysis was used to confirm construct validity. This questionnaire was 
distributed among 452 patient-care workers in hospitals located in different 
geographically areas in Qom, Iran. Cronbach's Alpha was calculated to assess 
reliability.
RESULTS: In all, 452 caregivers of patients with mean age of 37.71 (standard 
deviation=8.3) years participated in the study. An exploratory factor analysis 
loaded seven concepts of self-efficacy, knowledge, outcome perception, 
self-control, emotional coping, and self-efficacy in overcoming impediments and 
challenges in the environment. All concepts were jointly accounted for 50.08% of 
variance of behavior change. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient showed favorable 
internal consistency (alpha=0.83), and test-retest of the scale with 2-week 
intervals indicated an appropriate stability for the MWRLBPPQ.
CONCLUSIONS: The MWRLBPPQ is a reliable and valid theory-based instrument that 
can be used to predict factors influencing work-related low back pain among 
workers who lift and transfer patients in hospitals.

PURPOSE: This study explored which health care providers could be involved in 
centralized intake for patients with nonspecific low back pain to enhance 
access, continuity, and appropriateness of care.
METHODS: We reviewed the scope of practice regulations for a range of health 
care providers. We also conducted telephone interviews with 17 individuals 
representing ten provincial colleges and regulatory bodies to further understand 
providers' legislated scopes of practice. Activities relevant to triaging and 
assessing patients with low back pain were mapped against professionals' scope 
of practice.
RESULTS: Family physicians and nurse practitioners have the most comprehensive 
scopes and can complete all restricted activities for spine assessment and 
triage, while the scope of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses are 
progressively narrower. Chiropractors, occupational therapists, 
physiotherapists, and athletic therapists are considered experts in 
musculoskeletal assessments and appear best suited for musculoskeletal specific 
assessment and triage. Other providers may play a complementary role depending 
on the individual patient needs.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that an interprofessional assessment and 
triage team that includes allied health professionals would be a feasible option 
to create a centralized intake model. Implementation of such teams would require 
removing barriers that currently prevent providers from delivering on their full 
scope of practice.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is a major cause of low back 
pain, and is a common and disabling condition worldwide. It has been defined and 
measured by multiple spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, but the 
heterogeneity among them has never been fully addressed.
PURPOSE: This study examined the intercorrelations, risk factor associations, 
and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritabilities of lumbar disc MRI 
features in a large-scale sample to classify the different intervertebral disc 
phenotypes associated with LDD.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted consisting of 2,943 
volunteers of Southern Chinese origin (mean age: 41.1 years; range: 15-55 years; 
59.6% women).
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were MRI phenotypic spinal patterns and 
their risk factor profiles in relation to developmental or degenerative origins 
of disc degeneration.
METHODS: Sagittal T2-weighted MRI of the lumbar spine from L1 to S1 was 
assessed. The MRI features of lumbar intervertebral disc changes, such as disc 
signal intensity loss and disc bulges or extrusions, as well as additional 
imaging phenotypes of end plate changes, high-intensity zones, and bone marrow 
changes, were evaluated. Blood samples were taken for genotyping using the 
HumanOmni-ZhongHua-8 BeadChip. Subject demographics, environmental, and 
lifestyle factors were assessed by questionnaires. Multivariate statistical 
techniques were used for phenotype evaluation. Polychoric correlations and local 
regression statistical analyses were performed. The genetic components 
contributed by common SNPs were estimated by comparing genetic correlations and 
phenotypic correlations using the Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) 
tool.
RESULTS: The study noted that lumbar disc MRI features separated into two groups 
with differential patterns of risk factor associations. A subset of lumbar disc 
abnormalities, including end plate changes but also upper lumbar disc bulging 
and signal intensity loss, may have a developmental origin. Subsequent 
degenerative changes, typically affecting the lower lumbar discs, then emerge as 
individuals age and are associated with body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale study to identify two distinct 
patterns of lumbar disc alterations, noting degenerative changes and a possible 
developmental component affecting the lumbar spine. This new classification 
provides a starting point for a more homogeneous phenotype definition, which may 
provide greater statistical power and precision in future genetic and 
epidemiologic studies. In addition, such insights may have direct clinical 
implications in the prevention, therapeutics, and prognostics of patients with 
disc degeneration.

This study is meant to analyze the clinical and therapeutic aspects of 
abnormalities ureteropelvic junction. Cross-sectional and descriptive study on 
35 cases of abnormalities of the AUPJ collected the Urology Department of the 
University Hospital of Point G for a period of 4 years (January 2010 to December 
2014). Data were collected on the survey forms, medical records and records of 
the block. The socio-demographic, clinical and therapeutic data were entered 
into Microsoft Word 2007 and Excel 2007 and analyzed on SPSS 18.0. Between 
January 2010 and December 2014, 35 cases of AUPJ were collected. The average age 
was 29.3 years. The back pain was the most frequent reason for consultation or 
40%. 20% of patients were consulting for the first time 10 years symptomatic 
evolution. Kidney destruction was observed in 28.6%. The association Ultrasound 
+ IVU has established the diagnosis in 37.1%. A urinary tract infection was 
found in 60%. The gallstone complication was present in 17.1% of patients. 51.4% 
of patients received open pyeloplasty by Anderson Kuss. The anomaly of the 
ureteropelvic junction in our study was marked by a consultation with delay 
formidable complications. The open surgery has been the gold standard with 
satisfactory results. The endopyéloplasty, the treatment of laparoscopic 
minimally invasive joint surgeries are not available to us but to encourage and 
incorporate in the therapeutic arsenal.

Cette étude a été faite pour analyser les aspects cliniques et thérapeutiques 
des anomalies de la jonction pyélo-urétérale. Etude transversale et descriptive 
portant sur 35 cas d'anomalies de la jonction pyélo-urétérale (AJPU) colligés au 
service d'Urologie du CHU du Point G durant une période de 4 ans (Janvier 2010 
au Décembre 2014). Les données ont été recueillies sur les fiches d'enquête, les 
dossiers médicaux et les registres du bloc. Les données sociodémographique, 
clinique et thérapeutique ont été saisies sur Microsoft Word 2007 et analysées 
sur Excel 2007 et SPSS 18.0. 35 cas d'AJPU ont été colligés en 4 ans. La moyenne 
d’âge était de 29,3 ans. La douleur lombaire était le motif de consultation le 
plus fréquent soit 40%. 20% des patients ont été en consultation pour la 
première fois 10 ans d’évolution symptomatique. Une destruction rénale avait été 
observée dans 28,6%. Le couple Echographie + UIV a permis d’établir le 
diagnostic chez 37,1%. La complication lithiasique était présente chez 17,1% des 
patients. 51,4% des patients ont reçu une pyéloplastie à ciel ouvert selon 
Anderson KUSS. L'anomalie de la jonction pyélo-urétérale dans notre étude a été 
caractérisée par un retard de consultation avec des complications redoutables. 
La chirurgie à ciel ouvert a été le gold standard avec des résultats 
satisfaisants. L'endopyéloplastie, la cure de la jonction coelioscopique sont 
des chirurgies mini invasives non disponible chez nous mais à encourager et à 
intégrer dans l'arsenal thérapeutique.

BACKGROUND: There was controversy in finding of studies related pelvic floor 
muscle (PFM) rehabilitation of subjects with low back pain (LBP), while this 
issue is very important for treatment of subjects with LBP.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate PFM contraction in three 
conditions of alone and with abdominal hollowing (AH) or abdominal bracing (AB) 
maneuvers in subjects with and without chronic LBP.
METHODS: Subjects were divided into two groups: subjects with LBP (N = 25) and 
without LBP (N = 27). PFM contraction alone and during contraction with AH or AB 
maneuvers was measured. The amount of bladder base movement was measured as an 
indicator of PFM activity.
RESULTS: There were no differences in PFM activity between subjects with and 
without chronic LBP, when PFM contracted alone (P = 0.60), contracted with AH 
(P= 0.12) and AB maneuver (P = 0.54). Our data revealed that contraction of the 
PFM alone produce greater displacement of the bladder base than contraction of 
the PFM with AH (P = 0.005) or AB maneuver (P = 0.001) in both groups. However, 
no significant difference was found between contraction of the PFM with AH and 
AB maneuver in individuals with LBP (P = 0.31).
CONCLUSION: It seems that PFM contraction alone is more effective than PFM 
contraction with AH or AB maneuvers in lifting the pelvic floor in subjects with 
and without LBP.

Ultrasonography is currently widely used in the rheumatology practice. Although 
mainly performed to study peripheral joint, several articles have underlined its 
interest to study spinal anatomy. However, its ability to provide diagnostic 
features is unknown. We studied the case of a 25-year-old woman having low back 
pain. Three different imaging modalities (Computed Tomography [CT], Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging [MRI] and Ultrasound) were used to explore it. CT and MRI 
showed a foraminal dilation of the lombo-ovarian vein at the L3-L4 level with a 
scalloping of the lateral edge of L3. We were able to detect it with Color 
Doppler Ultrasound and a malformation of the inferior vena cava was also found. 
We showed for the first time that Color Doppler Ultrasound can detect venous 
malformation of the spine. This imaging modality could help us in the diagnosis 
of atypical lesions of the spine to confirm their vascular origin.

The link between gait parameters and foot abnormalities in association with low 
back pain is not well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate 
the effects of excessive foot pronation as well as the association of LBP with 
excessive foot pronation on the GRF components during shod walking.
METHODS: Forty-five subjects were equally divided into a control group, a group 
of subjects with pronated feet only, and another group with pronated feet and 
LBP. Ground reaction forces were analyzed during shod walking.
RESULTS: Foot pronation without low back pain was associated with increased 
lateral-medial ground reaction force, impulse, and time to peak of all reaction 
forces in heel contact phase (p<0.03). In low back pain patients with pronated 
foot, greater vertical reaction forces (p=0.001) and loading rate, and time to 
peak on propulsion force were observed compared to pronated foot without low 
back pain group. Impulse in posterior-anterior reaction force was smaller in the 
able-bodied group with normal foot than in the other groups (p<0.05). Positive 
peak of free moments of the LBP group was significantly greater than that in 
other groups (p<0.05). In conclusion, foot pronation alone was not associated 
with elevated vertical ground reaction forces. While, low back pain patients 
with foot pronation displayed higher vertical ground reaction force as well as 
higher loading rate. Present results reveal that gait ground reaction force 
components in low back pain patients with pronated foot may have clinical values 
on the prognosis and rehabilitation of mechanical LBP patients.

PURPOSE: The purpose of our prospective study was to assess the presentation of 
Schmorl's nodes (SN) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and investigate their 
possible association with demographic and clinical findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-three patients were 
prospectively included. Thirteen (3.9%) patients were excluded because of 
contraindication to MRI and/or Scheuermann's disease. The final study population 
included 320 patients. T1-weighted and short TI inversion recovery sequences 
were performed to assess SN prevalence, the vertebral level and their anatomical 
distribution in vertebra. Medical history was recorded focusing on previous 
diseases including degenerative, rheumatoid and neoplastic disease, and any 
existing spinal traumatism. Epidemiological information was also obtained, 
including age, gender, ethnicity, professional and sporting activity.
RESULTS: The final study population included 320 patients (172 men, 148 women) 
with a mean age of 54 years±17.5 (SD) (range: 19-87 years). A total of 421 SN 
were found in 158/320 patients (49.4%). SN were localized in thoracic spine for 
48%, in lumbar spine for 46% and cervical spine for 6%. The middle part of the 
thoracic vertebra was the most affected area (80%), mostly in the middle 
superior endplate (41%). SN were more frequently observed in manual workers who 
worked more than 10 years (P<0.0001) and less frequently in patients of the 
30-39-year-old age group (P=0.0048). No significant associations were found with 
gender (P=0.17) and remarkable medical history (P=0.21). SN were less frequently 
observed in patients with sport activities of 1-5hours/week (P=0.04) and those 
with an African origin (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a potential role for ethnical and physical 
factors in the pathogenesis of SN. Furthers studies are mandatory to evaluate 
their clinical relevance, especially in patients such as Caucasian manual 
workers in whom SN have a high prevalence.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to present the experimental setup, the 
development, and implementation of a new scalable model capable of efficiently 
handling data required to determine low back kinetics during high-velocity 
low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM).
METHODS: The model was implemented in Visual3D software. All contact forces and 
moments between the patient and the external environment (2 clinician hand 
contact forces, 1 contact force between the patient and the treatment table), 
the patient upper body kinematics, and inertial properties were used as input. 
Spine kinetics and kinematics were determined from a single HVLA-SM applied to 
one healthy participant in a right side-lying posture to demonstrate the model's 
utility. The net applied force was used to separate the spine kinetic and 
kinematic time-series data from the HVLA-SM into preload as well as early and 
late impulse phases.
RESULTS: Time-series data obtained from the HVLA-SM procedure showed that the 
participant's spine underwent left axial rotation, combined with extension, and 
a reduction in left lateral bending during the procedure. All components of the 
reaction force, as well as the axial twist and flexion/extension reaction 
moments demonstrated a sinusoidal pattern during the early and late impulse 
phases. During the early impulse phase, the participant's spine experienced a 
leftward axial twisting moment of 37.0 Nm followed by a rightward moment of 
-45.8 Nm. The lateral bend reaction moment exhibited a bimodal pattern during 
the early and late impulse phases.
CONCLUSION: This model was the first attempt to directly measure all contact 
forces acting on the participant/patient's upper body, and integrate them with 
spine kinematic data to determine patient low back reaction forces and moments 
during HVLA-SM in a side-lying posture. Advantages of this model include the 
brevity of data collection (<1 hour), and adaptability for different patient 
anthropometries and clinician-patient contacts.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether specific MRI 
features, such as axial location and type of herniation, are associated with 
outcomes of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation patients treated with spinal 
manipulation therapy (SMT).
METHODS: MRI and treatment outcome data from 68 patients were included in this 
prospective outcomes study. Pain numerical rating scale (NRS) and Oswestry 
physical disability questionnaire (OPDQ) levels were measured at baseline. The 
Patients Global Impression of Change scale, the NRS and the OPDQ were collected 
at 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6 months and 1 year. One radiologist and 2 chiropractic 
medicine master's degree students analyzed the MRI scans blinded to treatment 
outcomes. κ statistics assessed inter-rater reliability of MRI diagnosis. The 
proportion of patients reporting relevant improvement at each time point was 
compared based on MRI findings using the chi-square test. The t test and ANOVA 
compared the NRS and OPDQ change scores between patients with various MRI 
abnormalities.
RESULTS: A higher proportion of patients with disc sequestration reported 
relevant improvement at each time point but this did not quite reach statistical 
significance. Patients with disc sequestration had significantly higher 
reduction in leg pain at 1 month compared to those with extrusion (P = .02). 
Reliability of MRI diagnosis ranged from substantial to perfect (K = .733-1.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sequestered herniations treated with SMT to the level 
of herniation reported significantly higher levels of leg pain reduction at 1 
month and a higher proportion reported improvement at all data collection time 
points but this did not reach statistical significance.

Sympathetic Dysfunction in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain and Failed Back 
Surgery Syndrome.

El-Badawy MA(1), El Mikkawy DM.

Author information:
(1)Physical Medicine & Rheumatology Department.

BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is defined as pain that persists longer 
than 12 weeks and is often attributed to degenerative or traumatic conditions of 
the spine. Failed back surgery syndrome is a condition in which chronic pain 
persists after spinal surgery. Electrodiagnostic studies can be used to confirm 
the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy, but other diagnostic methods are 
often needed to assess sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the affection of 
sympathetic skin response (SSR) in cases of chronic low back pain (LBP) and 
failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and to assess the association of SSR 
abnormalities with perceived functional disability and pain among these 
patients.
METHODOLOGY: Twenty patients with CLBP and 10 patients with failed FBSS who 
fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited to the present study. All cases 
had back, leg, or back and leg pain of at least 3-month duration or following 
spinal surgery. The control group consists of 10 healthy participants matched in 
age and sex. Electrophysiologic nerve conduction studies and SSR recording were 
applied on the symptomatic and normal side in study cases and on both sides in 
the control group. Pain intensity was analyzed by the visual analogue scale 
(VAS) and perceived functional disability was assessed with the Oswestry 
disability index (ODI).
CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the sympathetic nervous system is affected in 
CLBP and FBSS patients with abnormalities in SSR and that the dysfunction of 
sympathetic nervous system may contribute to the intensity and chronicity of 
pain in these groups of patients. Moreover, a strong association was found 
between SSR and functional disabilities in these patients.

This paper deals with two recent cases of Inferior Caval Vein (IVC) duplicity, 
congenital anomaly often but not always asymptomatic that should be considered 
in the differential diagnosis of flank pain when other more common disorders 
have been excluded. Here are described the clinical and surgical significance 
together with the typical sonographic findings useful for the diagnosis of IVC 
duplicity. Particular attention is given to a peculiar and easily repeatable 
sonographic aspect associated with IVC duplicity, not previously reported in 
Literature and that we called the "Neptune's sign".

Publisher: In questo lavoro vengono riportati 2 recenti casi di duplicità della 
Vena Cava Inferiore (VCI) che è un'anomalia congenita spesso, ma non sempre, 
asintomatica e che deve essere considerata nella diagnosi differenziale di 
dolore al fianco, quando le altre cause più comuni sono state escluse. Oltre 
all' importanza clinica e chirurgica della duplicità della VCI ne vengono 
descritti gli elementi ultrasonografici utili per la diagnosi. Particolare 
attenzione è dedicata ad un aspetto ecografico peculiare, facilmente ripetibile, 
associato con la duplicità della VCI e non precedentemente riportato in 
letteratura che abbiamo chiamato il "segno di Nettuno".

Unique Presentation of Hematometrocolpos Mimicking Cauda Equina Syndrome: Severe 
Back Pain and Urinary Incontinence in an Adolescent Girl.

Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: Imperforate hymen with hematometrocolpos in adolescent females is a 
rare pediatric condition. Classical presentation includes abdominal pain or a 
pelvic mass in female patients with primary amenorrhea. Atypical complaints and 
reluctance among emergency physicians to perform genital examination in the 
emergency department or the pediatric emergency department (PED) may delay 
correct diagnosis.
CASE REPORT: We report a unique, cauda equina syndrome-like presentation of 
hematometrocolpos secondary to imperforate hymen in a 13-year old, previously 
healthy girl with primary amenorrhea. In the PED, the unusual clinical 
presentation of severe back pain and urinary incontinence initially mimicked 
cauda equina syndrome and led to delayed correct diagnosis. WHY SHOULD AN 
EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The novelty of this case is a cauda 
equina-like presentation of imperforate hymen secondary to hematocolpos. This 
report illustrates the highly variable clinical presentation of this rare 
gynecological pediatric entity. It underlines the importance of considering this 
rare condition in the differential diagnosis of severe upper or lower back pain 
alongside voiding abnormalities including urinary retention and incontinence in 
adolescent females with primary amenorrhea. Above all, the importance of 
performing a thorough history and genital examination in this subgroup early in 
the investigation process in the PED emerges from this case. Essentially, 
excellent clinical judgment and genital examination by the emergency physician 
may minimize unnecessary radiological investigations and ultimately, accelerate 
correct diagnosis and expedite appropriate surgical treatment. However, not only 
pediatric and adult emergency physicians, but also pediatricians and general 
practitioners should be aware of this entity and its diverse clinical 
presentation.

    BMC Musculoskelet Disord. 2016 Aug 26;17:371.

BACKGROUND: Vertebral endplate (Modic) abnormalities are important structural 
lesions in the spine, but their association with body composition and fat 
distribution have not been examined. Moreover, no study has examined whether 
Modic change are related to other structural features of low back pain, such as 
reduced intervertebral disc height.
METHODS: Seventy-two community-based individuals not selected for low back pain 
had lumbar vertebral Modic change and intervertebral disc height assessed from 
MRI. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measured body composition and fat 
distribution.
RESULTS: The predominance of Modic change was type 2. Modic change was 
associated with an increased fat mass index (OR 1.20, 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.43), and 
tended to be associated with a reduced fat-free mass index (OR 0.62, 95 % CI 
0.37 to 1.03, p = 0.07). While an increased percentage of gynoid fat was 
associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.62, 95 % CI 0.43 to 0.89), an increased 
percentage of android fat was associated with an increased risk of Modic change 
(OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.18 to 3.76). Modic change was also associated with reduced 
intervertebral disc height at L2/3, L4/5 and L5/S1 (OR range 1.4 to 1.8; all p ≤ 
0.03).
CONCLUSION: Modic type 2 change is associated with reduced intervertebral disc 
height and an increased fat mass index. Whereas gynoid fat distribution 
protected against Modic type 2 change, an android pattern increased the risk of 
this lesion. Modic type 2 change, which histologically represent fat 
replacement, might have a metabolic component to its aetiology.

Background Low back pain (LBP) is a major concern among North American 
workplaces and little is known regarding a supervisor's decision to support job 
accommodation for workers with LBP. The extent to which supervisors are included 
in a company's effort to institute disability management policies and practices 
and workplace safety climate are two factors that may influence a supervisor's 
decision to accommodate workers with LBP. Objective Determine the association 
between supervisors' perceptions of disability management policies, corporate 
safety culture and their likelihood of supporting job accommodations for workers 
with LBP. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of supervisors (N=796) 
recruited from a non-random, convenience sample of 19 Canadian and US employers. 
The outcome was supervisors' likeliness to support job accommodation and the 
exposure was global work safety culture and disability management policies and 
practices. A multivariable generalized linear modelling strategy was used and 
final models for each exposure were obtained after assessing potential effect 
modifiers and confounders. Results In the study, 796 eligible supervisors from 
19 employers participated. Disability management policies and practices were 
positively associated with supervisors' likeliness to accommodate (β=0.19; 95% 
CI: 0.13; 0.24) while no significant association was found between corporate 
safety culture (β= -0.084; 95% CI: -0.19; 0.027) and supervisors' likeliness to 
accommodate. Conclusions Employers should ensure that proactive disability 
management policies and practices are clearly communicated to supervisors in 
order to improve job modification and return to work efforts. Implications for 
Rehabilitation Low back pain (LBP) is a major workplace concern and little is 
known regarding what factors are associated with a supervisor's likelihood to 
support job accommodation for workers with LBP. The objective of this article 
was to determine the association between supervisors' perceptions of disability 
management policies and practices, corporate safety culture and their likelihood 
of support job accommodations for workers with LBP. Results suggest that 
disability management policies and practices are positively associated with 
supervisors' likelihood to accommodate while corporate safety culture is not. 
These results are important for employers as it suggests that employers should 
ensure that their disability management policies and practices are clearly 
communicated to supervisors in order to improve job accommodation and return to 
work efforts.

1Z1.

BACKGROUND: Motor control exercise (MCE) is used by healthcare professionals 
worldwide as a common treatment for low back pain (LBP). However, the 
effectiveness of this intervention for acute LBP remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of MCE for patients with acute 
non-specific LBP.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), four other databases and two trial registers from 
their inception to April 2015, tracked citations and searched reference lists. 
We placed no limitations on language nor on publication status.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
examining the effectiveness of MCE for patients with acute non-specific LBP. We 
considered trials comparing MCE versus no treatment, versus another type of 
treatment or added as a supplement to other interventions. Primary outcomes were 
pain intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were function, quality of life 
and recurrence.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened for potentially 
eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. A third independent 
review author resolved disagreements. We examined MCE in the following 
comparisons: (1) MCE versus spinal manipulative therapy; (2) MCE versus other 
exercises; and (3) MCE as a supplement to medical management. We used the GRADE 
(Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to 
assess the quality of evidence. For missing or unclear information, we contacted 
study authors. We considered the following follow-up intervals: short term (less 
than three months after randomisation); intermediate term (at least three months 
but within 12 months after randomisation); and long term (12 months or longer 
after randomisation).
MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials in this review (n = 197 participants). 
Study sample sizes ranged from 33 to 123 participants. Low-quality evidence 
indicates no clinically important differences between MCE and spinal 
manipulative therapy for pain at short term and for disability at short term and 
long term. Low-quality evidence also suggests no clinically important 
differences between MCE and other forms of exercise for pain at short or 
intermediate term and for disability at intermediate term or long term 
follow-up. Moderate-quality evidence shows no clinically important differences 
between MCE and other forms of exercise for disability at short term follow-up. 
Finally, very low-quality evidence indicates that addition of MCE to medical 
management does not provide clinically important improvement for pain or 
disability at short term follow-up. For recurrence at one year, very low-quality 
evidence suggests that MCE and medical management decrease the risk of 
recurrence by 64% compared with medical management alone.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified only three small trials that also evaluated 
different comparisons; therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the 
effectiveness of MCE for acute LBP. Evidence of very low to moderate quality 
indicates that MCE showed no benefit over spinal manipulative therapy, other 
forms of exercise or medical treatment in decreasing pain and disability among 
patients with acute and subacute low back pain. Whether MCE can prevent 
recurrences of LBP remains uncertain.

[BRUCELLA MELITENSIS (BM) BACTEREMIA IN HOSPITALIZED ADULT PATIENTS IN SOUTHERN 
ISRAEL].

[Article in Hebrew]

Glick Y, Levin E, Saidel-Odes L, Schlaeffer F, Riesenberg K.

BACKGROUND: Southern Israel is endemic for Brucella melitensis (BM) infection.
AIMS: This study aims to describe clinical manifestations and laboratory 
abnormalities in hospitalized adults with BM-bacteremia and to assess the 
relationship between various laboratory parameters, outcomes and complications 
of brucellosis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study. All BM bacteremic patients hospitalized 
in the Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC) during 2006-2011 were included. 
Demographic, clinical data and laboratory results were collected from the 
medical records.
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included in the study, mostly of 
Bedouin-Arab origin (92%). The average age was 44 years (±18.4) and included 62 
females (54%) of whom 11 were pregnant. Most of the subjects were exposed to 
sheep or their milk or meat products. The main symptoms included fever, 
arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and low back pain. Complications were present in 
22 patients (19%): arthritis and osteomyelitis (59%), spontaneous abortion (36% 
of pregnant woman), endocarditis and epididymitis. The incidence of 
complications was correlated to anemia and leukopenia (p=0.03) and to a low 
neutrophil count (p=0.009). A decrease of albumin by one unit correlated with an 
increased hospitalization length by 1.9 days; older age also correlated with a 
prolonged stay. Complications were present in 45% of pregnant women vs. 10% in 
non-pregnant women (p=0.011. Relapse occurred in nine patients (8%); only one of 
these received adequate antibiotic treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: MB-bacteremia in southern Israel occurs mainly in Bedouin-Arabs 
after exposure to sheep or their products. Older age and low albumin levels 
increase hospitalization. Leukopenia, mainly low neutrophil count, and low 
thrombocyte count can predict complications. Pregnant women have a higher 
incidence of complications. Relapse is rare under adequate antibiotic treatment.

Diagnosis of lumbar foraminal stenosis remains difficult. Here, we report on a 
case in which bilateral lumbar foraminal stenosis was difficult to diagnose, and 
in which diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was useful. The patient was a 
52-year-old woman with low back pain and pain in both legs that was dominant on 
the right. Right lumbosacral nerve compression due to a massive uterine myoma 
was apparent, but the leg pain continued after a myomectomy was performed. No 
abnormalities were observed during nerve conduction studies. Computed tomography 
and magnetic resonance imaging indicated bilateral L5 lumbar foraminal stenosis. 
DTI imaging was done. The extraforaminal values were decreased and tractography 
was interrupted in the foraminal region. Bilateral L5 vertebral foraminal 
stenosis was treated by transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion and the pain in 
both legs disappeared. The case indicates the value of DTI for diagnosing 
vertebral foraminal stenosis.

OBJECTIVES: Abnormalities of lumbopelvic coordination have been suggested to 
relate to risk of developing low back pain. The objective of this study is to 
review and summarize the findings of studies that have implemented and reported 
on lumbopelvic rhythm during trunk forward bending and backward return.
METHODS: The PUBMED and CINAHL databases were searched for studies related to 
LPR using appropriate keywords. The references of each study from the database 
search were further investigated to identify any missed study.
RESULTS: The findings includes results related to lumbopelvic rhythm, and how it 
varies due to participant characteristics such as age, gender, and presence of 
low back pain as well as due to variations in the experimental procedures such 
as pace of motion, presence of external load, and muscle fatigue.
CONCLUSION: In general, the magnitude of lumbar contribution is smaller in 
people with low back pain, in the elderly and females, as well as with greater 
pace of motion, but is larger with greater external load or back muscle fatigue. 
The compiled data in this review are expected to serve as a foundation for 
implementation of this kinematic-based measure in the conduct of future 
research.

Posterior Branches of Lumbar Spinal Nerves - Part I: Anatomy and Functional 
Importance.

Kozera K(1), Ciszek B(1).

Author information:

University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.

The aim of this paper is to compare anatomic descriptions of posterior branches 
of the lumbar spinal nerves and, on this basis, present the location of these 
structures. The majority of anatomy textbooks do not describe these nerves in 
detail, which may be attributable to the fact that for many years they were 
regarded as structures of minor clinical importance. The state of knowledge on 
these nerves has changed within the last 30 years. Attention has been turned to 
their function and importance for both diagnostic practice and therapy of lower 
back pain. Summarising the available literature, we may conclude that the medial 
and lateral branches separate at the junction of the facet joint and the distal 
upper edge of the transverse process; that the size, course and area supplied 
differ between the lateral and the medial branch; and that facet joints receive 
multisegmental innervation. It has been demonstrated that medial branches are 
smaller than the respective lateral branches and they have a more constant 
course. Medial branches supply the area from the midline to the facet joint 
line, while lateral branches innervate tissues lateral to the facet joint. The 
literature indicates difficulties with determining specific anatomic landmarks 
relative to which the lateral branch and the distal medial branch can be 
precisely located. Irritation of sensory fibres within posterior branches of the 
lumbar spinal nerves may be caused by pathology of facet joints, deformity of 
the spine or abnormalities due to overloading or injury. The anatomic location 
and course of posterior branches of spinal nerves should be borne in mind to 
prevent damaging them during low-invasive analgesic procedures.

Institute, Palermo, Italy (APatti, GM); and Department of Biomedical Science, 
University of Padua, Padua, Italy (APaoli).

Various exercise interventions, such as Pilates exercises and traditional 
physical therapy methods, are employed to decrease low back pain (LBP). 
Nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP) is distinct from LBP, however, as the 
distribution of pain is restricted to the region between the costal margin and 
the inferior gluteal. The aim of our randomized controlled trial was to evaluate 
the effects of a program of Pilates exercises on pain perception and 
stabilometric parameters in patients with NSLBP.Thirty-eight participants were 
randomly allocated, using a 1:1 scheme, to either the experimental group (EG) or 
control group (CG). The EG completed a 14-week program of Pilates exercises, 
performed thrice per week under the supervision of an exercise specialist, while 
the CG was managed with a social program only. Measures of posturography and 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for pain perception were obtained at baseline 
(T0) and after the 14 weeks of intervention (T)1.Posturography measures improved 
for patients in the EG, with both eyes open and eyes closed (P < 0.05). There 
were no statistical differences in posturography in the CG. ODI decreased 
significantly in both groups over the 14 weeks of the study protocol: EG, T0, 
13.7 ± 5.0 compared with T1, 6.5 ± 4.0 (P < 0.001); and CG, T0, 10.7 ± 7.8 
compared with T1, 8.4 ± 7.8 (P < 0.01). A greater extent of reduction in pain 
was achieved in the EG.The Pilates exercise program yielded improvements in pain 
and posturography outcomes. Our study also confirms the applicability of 
posturography in evaluating postural instability in patients with NSLBP. Due to 
our relatively small study group, future studies would be necessary to confirm 
our findings.

OBJECTIVE: Research on chronic low back pain (cLBP) has focused heavily on 
structural abnormalities with emphasis on diagnostic imaging. However, for many 
cLBP patients, clinical pain and disability are not clearly associated with 
identifiable pathology of the spine or associated tissues. Therefore, 
alternative determinants such as psychological factors and dysfunctional pain 
modulatory processes have been suggested to be important.
METHODS: This observational study examined differences in pain catastrophizing 
and endogenous pain modulation between 25 cLBP patients and 25 pain-free 
controls. Associations among pain catastrophizing, endogenous pain modulatory 
processes, clinical pain reports, and disability were also examined in cLBP 
patients. Endogenous pain modulation was examined using temporal summation (TS) 
of mechanical and heat pain stimuli as well as conditioned pain modulation (CPM) 
with algometry (test stimulus) and the cold pressor task (conditioning 
stimulus).
RESULTS: Findings demonstrated significantly greater pain catastrophizing as 
well as greater TS of mechanical and heat pain for cLBP patients compared with 
controls. CPM was not present in cLBP patients or controls. Among cLBP patients, 
pain catastrophizing was significantly associated with disability, while TS of 
mechanical pain was significantly associated with clinical pain severity and 
disability.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that endogenous pain modulatory processes are 
altered for cLBP patients, particularly TS of mechanical and heat stimuli. Pain 
catastrophizing and TS of mechanical pain may have important clinical relevance 
for cLBP, given associations with clinical pain and disability; however, future 
research is needed to replicate these findings.

To evaluate the hyperalgesia and histological abnormalities induced by contact 
between the dorsal root ganglion and the nucleus pulposus.
METHODS: Twenty Wistar rats were used, divided into two experimental groups. In 
one of the groups, a fragment of autologous nucleus pulposus was removed from 
the sacrococcygeal region and deposited on the L5 dorsal root ganglia. In the 
other group (control), a fragment of adipose tissue was deposited on the L5 
dorsal root ganglia. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia was evaluated on the 
third day and the first, third, fifth and seventh weeks after the operation. A 
L5 dorsal root ganglion was removed in the first, third, fifth and seventh weeks 
after the operation for histological study using HE staining and histochemical 
study using specific labeling for iNOS.
RESULTS: Higher intensity of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia was observed in 
the group of animals in which the nucleus pulposus was placed in contact with 
the dorsal root ganglion. In this group, the histological study showed 
abnormalities of the dorsal root ganglion tissue, characterized by an 
inflammatory process and axonal degeneration. The histopathological 
abnormalities of the dorsal root ganglion tissue presented increasing intensity 
with increasing length of observation, and there was a correlation with 
maintenance of the hyperalgesia observed in the behavioral assessment. 
Immunohistochemistry using specific labeling for iNOS in the group of animals in 
which the nucleus pulposus was placed in contact with the dorsal root ganglion 
showed higher expression of this enzyme in the nuclei of the inflammatory cells 
(glial cells) surrounding the neurons.
CONCLUSION: Contact between the nucleus pulposus and the dorsal root ganglion 
induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and caused histological 
abnormalities in the dorsal root ganglion components. These abnormalities were 
characterized by an inflammatory and degenerative process in the structures of 
the dorsal root ganglion, and they presented increasing intensity with longer 
periods of observation.

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of sagittal lumbar spine 
postural abnormalities and associated factors among students in the federal 
educational system in Florianópolis.
METHODS: 288 adolescents (156 males and 132 females), aged from 15 to 18 years, 
who were students in the federal educational system in Florianópolis, Santa 
Catarina, were evaluated. To gather data, photogrammetry was used following a 
specific protocol for postural assessment, and a questionnaire was used to 
identify the prevalence and frequency of pain, and the activities that triggered 
the problem. In the data analysis, descriptive statistics, Student's t-test for 
independent samples, chi-square test and Poisson's regression were used, with 
the significance level set at p<0.05 for all the tests.
RESULTS: The prevalence of low back pain was 49.3%, with weekly frequency in 
43.1% of the sample. The prevalence of deviation was 53.8%, and 90.9% 
corresponded to rectification of lumbar curvature, and this affected males more 
frequently. A significant difference in lumbar angle was found between the 
sexes; higher prevalence ratios of postural deviations were found in the male 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalences of low back pain and lumbar postural deviation were 
high, but the relationship between these variables did not present significance. 
The main causes of the lumbar pain were sports practice or vigorous activities 
and remaining in a seated position for extended periods of time.

Imperforate hymen is a congenital anomaly of female external genitalia, which is 
mostly diagnosed in puberty, at the age of 9-13 years, or very rarely at a 
younger age. Clinical picture varies from abdominal pain and low back pain to 
acute urinary retention. We describe a case of a 16-month-old female infant 
where the imperforate hymen presented as a vaginal cyst. The cyst was first 
observed by the patient's mother, although the child had been examined by a 
paediatrician on several occasions after birth. Complete workup performed for 
differential diagnosis, mostly to exclude other reproductive system anomalies, 
led to the final diagnosis of imperforate hymen. The aim of this report is to 
emphasise the necessity of thorough examination of genitalia in female newborns 
in order to avoid possible complications associated with this diagnosis later in 
life, as well as other, more severe differential diagnostic anomalies.

STUDY DESIGN: Cized, single-blind, controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of the Arthrokinematic approach 
(AKA)-Hakata (H) method for chronic low back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The AKA-H method is used to manually treat 
abnormalities of intra-articular movement.
METHODS: One hundred eighty-six patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain 
randomly received either the AKA-H method (AKA-H group) or the sham technique (S 
group) monthly for 6 months. Data were collected at baseline and once a month. 
Outcome measures were pain intensity (visual analogue scale [VAS]) and quality 
of life (the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] and Short Form SF-36 
questionnaire [SF-36]).
RESULTS: At baseline, the VAS, RDQ, and SF-36 scores showed similar levels 
between the groups. After 6 months, the AKA-H group had more improvement in the 
VAS (42.8% improvement) and RDQ score (31.1% improvement) than the sham group 
(VAS: 10.4% improvement; RDQ: 9.8% improvement; both, P < 0.001). The respective 
scores for the SF-36 subscales (physical functioning, role physical, bodily 
pain, social functioning, general health perception, role emotional, and mental 
health) were also significantly more improved in the AKA-H group than in the 
sham group (all, P < 0.001). The scores for the physical, psychological, and 
social aspects of the SF-36 subscales showed similar improvement in the AKA-H 
group.
CONCLUSION: The AKA-H method can be effective in managing chronic low back pain.

A number of unusual conditions cause decreased bone mass and density in children 
and these may be associated with low-trauma fractures. However, a series of 
reports have more recently identified that children with chronic disease sustain 
vertebral fractures (VFs) much more often than had been suspected. The common 
denominator involved is glucocorticoid (GC) administration, although other 
factors such as disease activity come into play. This review will focus on the 
imaging findings in this form of secondary osteoporosis. Spinal fractures in 
children have been found to correlate with back pain. At the same time, up to 
2/3 of children with VFs in the GC-treated setting are asymptomatic, 
underscoring the importance of routine surveillance in at-risk children. Other 
predictors of prevalent and incident VFs include GC exposure (average daily and 
cumulative dose), declines in lumbar spine bone mineral density Z-scores and 
increases in body mass index Z-scores, as well as increases in disease activity 
scores. The imaging diagnosis of osteoporotic VFs in children is made 
differently from that in adults because immature vertebral bodies continue to 
ossify during growth. Thus, it is not possible to assess the vertebral end 
plates or periphery until late, as enchondral ossification extends centripetally 
within the centrum. Diagnosis, therefore, is much more dependent upon changes in 
shape than on loss of structural integrity, which may have a more prominent 
diagnostic role in adults. However, children have a unique ability to model (a 
growth-dependent process) and thereby reshape previously fractured vertebral 
bodies. If the underlying disease is successfully treated and the child has 
sufficient residual growth potential, this means that, on one hand, treatment of 
the bone disease may be of more limited duration, and, as a last recourse, the 
diagnosis may be apparent retrospectively.

    J Small Anim Pract. 2015 Dec;56(12):687-8.

OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively summarise chiropractic findings in dogs presented 
in a veterinary practice with urinary incontinence and urinary retention over a 
6-year period, and compare these to non-urinary patients presented during the 
same time period.
METHODS: Twenty-two cases were included in the study. They all first underwent a 
standard clinical examination to rule out or treat other possible causes of 
their urinary problems. They then underwent chiropractic examination and 
hypomobility findings were recorded using Gonstead listings. Odds ratios (ORs) 
were calculated for the occurrence of chiropractic findings in urinary versus 
non-urinary patients for each vertebra in the lumbar, sacral and ilial regions.
RESULTS: All patients had chiropractic findings in the lumbar region that 
differed from non-urinary patients. The urinary patients were significantly more 
likely to have chiropractic findings in L3 (OR=4 · 81; 95%CI: 2 · 02 to 11 · 44; 
P = 0 · 0004), L4 (OR=6 · 85; 95%CI: 2 · 63 to 17 · 84; P = 0 · 0001) and L5 
(OR=3 · 98; 95%CI: 1 · 64 to 9 · 69; P = 0 · 0023). In addition, urinary 
patients were significantly less likely to have chiropractic findings associated 
with the ilium (OR=0 · 26; 95%CI: 0 · 11 to 0 · 66; P = 0 · 0043).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report of an association between 
chiropractic findings in the lumbar vertebrae and urinary incontinence and 
retention in dogs.

OBJECTIVE: To outline the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, 
diagnostic criteria, and management options of femoroacetabular impingement 
(FAI).
SOURCES OF INFORMATION: PubMed was searched for relevant articles regarding the 
pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of FAI.
MAIN MESSAGE: In recent years, FAI has been increasingly recognized as a 
potential precursor and an important contributor to hip pain in the adult 
population and idiopathic hip osteoarthritis later in life. Femoroacetabular 
impingement is a collection of bony morphologic abnormalities of the hip joint 
that result in abnormal contact during motion. Cam-type FAI relates to a 
non-spherical osseous prominence of the proximal femoral neck or head-neck 
junction. Pincer-type FAI relates to excessive acetabular coverage over the 
femoral head, which can occur owing to several morphologic variants. Patients 
with FAI present with chronic, deep, or aching anterior groin pain most commonly 
in the sitting position, or during or after activity. Patients might also 
experience occasional sharp pains during activity. A thorough history should be 
taken that includes incidence of trauma and exercise frequency. A physical 
examination should be performed that includes a full hip, low back, and 
abdominal examination to assess for alternate causes of anterior groin pain. 
Diagnosis of FAI should be confirmed with radiography. Femoroacetabular 
impingement can be managed conservatively with rest, modification of activities, 
medications, and physiotherapy, or it can be treated surgically.
CONCLUSION: Femoroacetabular impingement is an important cause of anterior groin 
pain. Early recognition and intervention by the primary care provider might be 
critical to alleviating morbidity and preventing FAI progression.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lumbar discitis-osteomyelitis has imaging 
characteristics than can overlap with noninfectious causes of back pain. Our aim 
was to determine the added accuracy of psoas musculature T2 hyperintensity 
(imaging psoas sign) in the MR imaging diagnosis of lumbar 
discitis-osteomyelitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective case-control study evaluated lumbar 
spine MR imaging examinations, during a 30-month period, that were requested for 
the evaluation of discitis-osteomyelitis. Of this pool, 50 age-matched control 
patients were compared with 51 biopsy-proved or clinically diagnosed patients 
with discitis-osteomyelitis. Two reviewers, blinded to the clinical information, 
assessed the randomly organized MR imaging examinations for abnormalities of the 
psoas musculature, vertebral bodies, discs, and epidural space.
RESULTS: Psoas T2 hyperintensity demonstrated a high sensitivity (92.1%; 95% CI, 
80%-97.4%) and specificity (92%; 95% CI, 80%-97.4%), high positive likelihood 
ratio (11.5; 95% CI, 4.5-29.6), low negative likelihood ratio (0.09; 95% CI, 
0.03-0.20), and individual area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve of 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97. Identification of psoas T2 abnormality 
significantly improved (P = .02) the diagnostic accuracy of 
discitis-osteomyelitis in noncontrast examinations from an area under the 
receiver operator characteristic curve of the established variables (vertebral 
body T2 and T1 signal, endplate integrity, disc T2 signal, and disc height) from 
0.93 (95% CI, 0.88-0.98) to 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-1.0). Psoas T2 abnormalities also 
had the highest interobserver reliability with a κ coefficient of 0.78 
(substantial agreement).
CONCLUSIONS: Psoas T2 hyperintensity, the imaging psoas sign, is highly 
correlated with discitis-osteomyelitis. T2 hyperintensity in the psoas 
musculature, particularly when there is clinical suspicion of spinal infection, 
improves the diagnostic accuracy of discitis-osteomyelitis compared with routine 
noncontrast variables alone.

INTRODUCTION: The success of sacral nerve stimulation, a common treatment for 
pelvic floor disorders, depends on correct placement of the electrodes through 
the sacral foramina. When the bony anatomy and topography of the sacrum and 
sacral spinal nerves are intact, this is easily achieved; where sacral anomalies 
exist, it can be challenging. A better understanding of common sacral 
malformations can improve the success of sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) 
electrode placement.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 998 consecutive MRI scans performed to 
investigate low back pain in patients who had undergone CT and/or X-ray.
RESULTS: Congenital sacral malformations were found in 24.1%, the most common 
being sacral meningeal cysts (16%) and spina bifida occulta (9.9%). Others were 
lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (2.5%), anterior occult meningocele (0.5%), 
partial sacral agenesis (0.2%) and vertebral dysplasia of S1 (0.2%).
CONCLUSION: This radiologic review uncovered a high incidence of sacral 
malformations, and most were asymptomatic. All surgeons who perform SNS should 
have a basic understanding of sacral malformations, their incidence and effect 
on foraminal anatomy. Imaging will aid procedural planning.

We assessed the clinical value of repeat spine CT scan in 108 patients aged 
18-60 years who underwent repeat lumbar spine CT scan for low back pain or 
radiculopathy from January 2008 to December 2010. Patients with a neoplasm or 
symptoms suggesting underlying disease were excluded from the study. Clinical 
data was retrospectively reviewed. Index examinations and repeat CT scan 
performed at a mean of 24.3 ± 11.3 months later were compared by a senior 
musculoskeletal radiologist. Disc abnormalities (herniation, sequestration, 
bulge), spinal stenosis, disc space narrowing, and bony changes (osteophytes, 
fractures, other changes) were documented. Indications for CT scan were low back 
pain (60 patients, 55%), radiculopathy (46 patients, 43%), or nonspecific back 
pain (two patients, 2%). A total of 292 spine pathologies were identified in 98 
patients (90.7%); in 10 patients (9.3%) no spine pathology was seen on index or 
repeat CT scan. At repeat CT scan, 269/292 pathologies were unchanged (92.1%); 
10/292 improved (3.4%), 8/292 worsened (2.8%, disc herniation or spinal 
stenosis), and five new pathologies were identified. No substantial therapeutic 
change was required in patients with worsened or new pathology. Added diagnostic 
value from repeat CT scan performed within 2-3 years was rare in patients 
suffering chronic or recurrent low back pain or radiculopathy, suggesting that 
repeat CT scan should be considered only in patients with progressive neurologic 
deficits, new neurologic complaints, or signs implying serious underlying 
conditions.

Medicine, Daegu, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to clarify differences in the anatomic 
structure of the sacral hiatus and angle of needle insertion during caudal 
epidural steroid injection using ultrasound guidance in patients according to 
sex and age.
METHODS: A total of 237 patients with low back pain with or without sciatica 
were included. Sonograms of the sacral hiatus were obtained, and caudal epidural 
steroid injection using ultrasound guidance was performed in all patients. The 
intercornual distance, diameter of the sacral canal, thickness of the 
sacrococcygeal ligament, optimal angle for needle insertion, and actual angle of 
needle insertion were measured.
RESULTS: Between men and women, significant differences were observed for the 
intercornual distance (17.7 versus 16.5 mm; P< .01) and thickness of the 
sacrococcygeal ligament (4.3 versus 3.9 mm; P = .02). In all patients, the 
thickness of the sacrococcygeal ligament (r= 0.28) and diameter of the sacral 
canal (r= 0.40) were positively correlated with the optimal angle for needle 
insertion (P < .01). In women, the thickness of the sacrococcygeal ligament (r = 
-0.24), diameter of the sacral canal (r = -0.27), optimal angle for needle 
insertion (r = -0.29), and actual angle of needle insertion (r = -0.18) were 
negatively correlated with age. In men, only the diameter of the sacral canal 
was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.30).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the sacral hiatus has anatomic differences between 
patients of different sexes and ages. Understanding these differences, 
especially in women, may improve the safety and reliability of caudal epidural 
steroid injection.

AIM: The main goal of our study was to investigate the relationship between age, 
duration of pain, pain intensity, temperament traits as postulated by the 
Regulative Theory of Temperament (RTT), social support dimensions and the level 
of trauma symptoms, as appear in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a 
sample of 300 patients suffering from chronic pain in two groups comprised of 
150 patients with a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 150 
patients with a clinical diagnosis of low-back pain (LBP). They were analyzed 
together as a one group of 300 patients with chronic pain.
METHOD: Temperament was measured with the Formal Characteristics of Behaviour - 
Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI). Social support was tested with the Berlin Social 
Support Scales (BSSS). The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS-11) was used to measure 
pain intensity. The level of trauma symptoms was assessed with the 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Factorial Version Inventory (PTSDF).
RESULTS: The results of our study suggest that the intensity of pain, 
participants' age, Emotional Reactivity and Sensory Sensitivity as temperament 
traits, need for support, and actually received social support were related to 
the level of trauma symptoms. The sum of the squared semi-partial correlations 
showed that all six variables (age, pain intensity, Emotional Reactivity, 
Sensory Sensitivity, need for support and actually received support), account 
for 20% of the variance of general trauma symptoms level.
CONCLUSION: The importance of temperament traits, social support and trauma 
symptoms should be taken into an account in psychotherapy accompanying 
pharmacotherapy for pain.

BACKGROUND: Diagnostic imaging is often the first step in evaluating patients 
with back pain and likely functions as a "gateway" to a subsequent cascade of 
interventions. However, lumbar spine imaging frequently reveals incidental 
findings among normal, pain-free individuals suggesting that treatment of these 
"abnormalities" may not be warranted. Our prior work suggested that inserting 
the prevalence of imaging findings in patients without back pain into spine 
imaging reports may reduce subsequent interventions. We are now conducting a 
pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that 
inserting this prevalence data into lumbar spine imaging reports for studies 
ordered by primary care providers will reduce subsequent spine-related 
interventions.
METHODS/DESIGN: We are using a stepped wedge design that sequentially randomizes 
100 primary care clinics at four health systems to receive either standard 
lumbar spine imaging reports, or reports containing prevalence data for common 
imaging findings in patients without back pain. We capture all outcomes 
passively through the electronic medical record. Our primary outcome is 
spine-related intervention intensity based on Relative Value Units (RVUs) during 
the following year. Secondary outcomes include subsequent prescriptions for 
opioid analgesics and cross-sectional lumbar spine re-imaging.
DISCUSSION: If our study shows that adding prevalence data to spine imaging 
reports decreases subsequent back-related RVUs, this intervention could be 
easily generalized and applied to other kinds of testing, as well as other 
conditions where incidental findings may be common. Our study also serves as a 
model for cluster randomized trials that are minimal risk and highly pragmatic.

Orthopaedic involvement is the most common clinical presentation of 
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) patients with the spinal abnormalities more 
frequently affected. In the spinal deformities of NF-1 patients, despite the 
scoliosis is the most frequent finding, several distinctive radiographic 
features, such as dural ectasia, defective pedicles, and spondylolisthesis, are 
relatively less common. Here, we reported a 16-year-old boy diagnosed with NF-1 
who presented with dural ectasia, defective pedicles, and spondylolisthesis 
concomitantly, described the surgical treatment and provided a literature 
review. The boy complained of low back and leg pain for two months. On clinical 
examination, the patient showed multiple café au lait spots on his back and no 
neurological deficit. He had a family history of neurofibromatosis as his father 
suffering from NF-1. Imaging results demonstrated mild scoliosis, posterior 
scalloping of the lumber spine, L5 spondylolisthesis on plain radiographs, and 
marked dural ectasia of L3-L5 on MRI. Furthermore, the CT scan showed presence 
of thin pedicles at L3, bilateral symmetrical pedicle clefts at L4, and pars 
interarticularis fractures at L5. The patient received a long level posterior 
fusion from L1 to S1 with pedicle screws. Iliac crest autogenous graft mixed 
with artificial bone were used to achieve solid arthrodesis. At nine-month 
follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and able to live a normal life. Our 
observation demonstrated that familiarity with those distinctive features in 
NF-1 patients could be contributed to making an early diagnosis and optimizing 
treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the relative thickness change of the transversal 
abdominal (TrA) and lumbar multifidus (LM) muscles during activation in 
individuals with and without low back pain (LBP), and to establish a 
relationship between surface electromyography (sEMG) signal amplitude and the 
relative thickness change of the corresponding muscle during clinically relevant 
activity, with preferential activation of TrA/LM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven pain-free participants and 36 LBP patients 
were assessed by ultrasound for thickness changes of TrA and LM and by sEMG for 
changes of electrical activity of the same muscles. sEMG is done with wireless 
LUMBIA system. The position of the sEMG sensors and activation maneuvers were 
chosen carefully.
RESULTS: Significant group effect was found for relative thickness change of TrA 
(F1,142=60.69, P<0.0001) and LM (F1,142=36.01, P<0.0001). We found significant 
correlations between relative thickness change of TrA and sEMG signal amplitude 
on both sides for LBP (r=0.46 to 0.63, P<0.05) and pain-free patients 
(r=0.43-0.47, P<0.05). The correlation between LM thickness change and sEMG was 
significant in pain-free participants for both sides (r=0.36 to 0.38 P<0.05), 
and right LM in LBP participants (r=0.43, P<0.05), but not for LM in LBP group 
(r=0.16, P=0.351).
DISCUSSION: US and sEMG measurements can be used for objective TrA/LM 
assessment. Correlation results suggest that the relative change of the muscle 
thickness could be used as the indicator of the muscle activity. Insight into 
the activity of TrA/LM in pain-free individuals and LBP patients during and 
after painful episodes may clarify the role of functional abnormalities of these 
muscles in LBP.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Current literature suggests that in the long-term, fusion of 
the lumbar spine in chronic low back pain (CLBP) does not result in an outcome 
clearly better than structured conservative treatment modes.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the long-term outcome of lumbar fusion in 
CLBP, and also to assess methodological problems in long-term randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs).
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized study was carried out.
PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 294 patients (144 women and 150 men) with CLBP of at 
least 2 years' duration were randomized to lumbar fusion or non-specific 
physiotherapy. The mean follow-up time was 12.8 years (range 9-22). The follow 
up rate was 85%; exclusion of deceased patients resulted in a follow-up rate of 
92%.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Global Assessment (GA) of back pain, Oswestry Disability Index 
(ODI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, Zung depression scale 
were determined. Work status, pain medication, and pain frequency were also 
documented.
METHODS: Standardized outcome questionnaires were obtained before treatment and 
at long-term follow-up. To optimize control for group changers, four models of 
data analysis were used according to (1) intention to treat (ITT), (2) "as 
treated" (AT), (3) per protocol (PP), and (4) if the conservative group 
automatically classify group changers as unchanged or worse in GA (GCAC). The 
initial study was sponsored by Acromed (US$50,000-US$100,000).
RESULTS: Except for the ITT model, the GA, the primary outcome measure, was 
significantly better for fusion. The proportion of patients much better or 
better in the fusion group was 66%, 65%, and 65% in the AT, PP, and GCAC models, 
respectively. In the conservative group, the same proportions were 31%, 37%, and 
22%, respectively. However, the ODI, VAS back pain, work status, pain 
medication, and pain frequency were similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: One can conclude that from the patient's perspective, reflected by 
the GA, lumbar fusion surgery is a valid treatment option in CLBP. On the other 
hand, secondary outcome measures such as ODI and work status, best analyzed by 
the PP model, indicated that substantial disability remained at long-term after 
fusion as well as after conservative treatment. The lack of objective outcome 
measures in CLBP and the cross-over problem transforms an RCT to an 
observational study, that is, Level 2 evidence. The discrepancy between the 
primary and secondary outcome measures prevents a strong conclusion on whether 
to recommend fusion in non-specific low back pain.

PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal a range of degenerative 
findings and anatomical abnormalities; however, the clinical importance of these 
remains uncertain and controversial. We aimed to investigate if the presence of 
MRI findings identifies patients with low back pain (LBP) or sciatica who 
respond better to particular interventions.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched. We included RCTs 
investigating MRI findings as treatment effect modifiers for patients with LBP 
or sciatica. We excluded studies with specific diseases as the cause of LBP. 
Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria of the Cochrane Back Review Group. 
Each MRI finding was examined for its individual capacity for effect 
modification.
RESULTS: Eight published trials met the inclusion criteria. The methodological 
quality of trials was inconsistent. Substantial variability in MRI findings, 
treatments and outcomes across the eight trials prevented pooling of data. 
Patients with Modic type 1 when compared with patients with Modic type 2 had 
greater improvements in function when treated by Diprospan (steroid) injection, 
compared with saline. Patients with central disc herniation when compared with 
patients without central disc herniation had greater improvements in pain when 
treated by surgery, compared with rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although individual trials suggested that some MRI findings might 
be effect modifiers for specific interventions, none of these interactions were 
investigated in more than a single trial. High quality, adequately powered 
trials investigating MRI findings as effect modifiers are essential to determine 
the clinical importance of MRI findings in LBP and sciatica (
PROSPERO: CRD42013006571).

Electromyography in musculoskeletal pain: A reappraisal and practical 
considerations.

Lazaro RP(1).

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Patients with musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and local tenderness in the 
back and extremities are frequently referred to electromyography (EMG) 
laboratory to assess the integrity of the spinal nerve roots, peripheral nerves, 
and skeletal muscles. When focal muscle weakness and anatomical sensory deficits 
are clinically evident, this procedure is almost always abnormal. In some 
situations, when the presenting symptoms consist of local pain and tenderness 
without neuromuscular deficits, its diagnostic utility becomes questionable as 
illustrated in the present study.
METHODS: EMG findings of 75 patients referred for evaluation of local MSP and 
tenderness in the neck and lower back and in the upper and lower extremities 
were reviewed. These patients were selected from a group of 200 patients 
referred for evaluation of unilateral local pain and tenderness in various parts 
of the body. All EMG procedures and clinical neurologic examination were 
performed by the author and all underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the 
affected parts of the body prior to the procedure. None of the 75 patients 
studied had concurrent medical disorders or had previous spinal root injuries or 
surgeries to the spine.
RESULTS: All 75 patients in this study showed normal EMG of the affected 
extremities and normal peripheral nerve conduction study. Those with herniated 
disc in the cervical or lumbar spine presenting with local pain and tenderness 
in the neck and lower back but without neurologic deficits or clear radicular 
symptoms, had normal study also. The remaining 125 patients excluded from the 
study, had various EMG and peripheral nerve abnormalities that can be attributed 
to concurrent medical disorders and previous injuries to the spinal roots.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of EMG in the diagnosis of local MSP, unless associated with 
clinical neurologic deficits, almost always yields negative results. The utility 
of this procedure is limited to pathology in the motor unit. It cannot assess 
the function of the sensory components of the spinal roots, small-diameter 
sensory nerves, and the sensory innervation of the spine via sinuvertebral 
nerve. Therefore, if the motor unit is anatomically and physiologically intact, 
the procedure is of little value in the diagnosis of MSP. Likewise, peripheral 
nerve conduction study is likely to be normal unless clear neurologic deficits 
are present. The present study illustrates that a good history and meticulous 
neurologic examination should be an integral part of an ideal electrodiagnostic 
procedure.

BACKGROUND: The term "low back pain syndrome" represents a complex nosological 
entity. The therapeutic approach is often only symptomatic and not etiologic.
METHODS: Since 2013, 186 patients (97 males and 89 females, mean age 59.8 years) 
have undergone microsurgery for lumbar disc hernia or lumbar segmental stenosis. 
Among these patients, 23 had been previously treated with ozone therapy by the 
intraforaminal approach and 28 by intraforaminal steroid injections in other 
hospitals between 12 and 24 months before our clinical evaluation. These 
patients received 16 applications in an 8-week period (standard therapy).
RESULTS: During the surgery, many hard adhesions between the soft tissues and 
bony structures were unexpectedly discovered. In particular, it was noted that 
the root contracted and had firm adhesions to the dural sac and/or fragmented 
disc, which were difficult to resolve. These specific pathological patterns were 
observed only in the patients who received ozone injections by the 
intraforaminal approach. We did not find any pathological abnormalities in the 
patients who did not receive any injections or who received intraforaminal 
steroid injections. Thus, we could exclude that the tissue damage was due to the 
mechanical action of the needle.
CONCLUSION: It is important to assert that ozone therapy procedures can be 
associated with several major complications. Therefore, performing a revision of 
the guidelines and protocols for ozone therapy application is indispensable.

Butterfly vertebra is a rare congenital malformation of the spine, which is 
usually reported in the literature as an isolated finding. We describe a 
40-year-old woman that presented to our emergency department with back pain and 
sciatica. Initial radiological evaluation revealed an incidental finding of a L4 
butterfly vertebra in the anteroposterior and lateral view radiographs. The 
patient presented with no neurological deficit. This rare congenital anomaly is 
usually asymptomatic, and awareness of its non-traumatic nature is critical in 
order to establish a correct diagnosis. Further evaluation of the patient is 
necessary to exclude pathologic fracture, infection, or associated vertebral 
anomalies and syndromes, such as Alagille, Jarcho-Levin, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer 
syndromes. Furthermore, in the emergency setting, awareness of this entity is 
needed so that a correct diagnosis can be established.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is a major health problem in industrialized 
societies. Spinal manipulation (SM) is often used for treating LBP, though the 
therapeutic mechanisms remain elusive. Research suggests that sensorimotor 
changes may be involved in LBP. It is hypothesized that SM may generate its 
beneficial effects by affecting sensorimotor functions.
OBJECTIVES: To compare changes in sensorimotor function, as measured by postural 
sway and response to sudden load, in LBP patients following the delivery of 
high-velocity low amplitude (HVLA)-SM or low-velocity variable amplitude 
(LVVA)-SM versus a sham control intervention.
DESIGN: A three-arm (1:1:1 ratio) randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: A total of 221 participants who were between 21 and 65 years, having 
LBP intensity (numerical rating scale) ≥4 at either phone screen or the first 
baseline visit and ≥2 at phone screen and both baseline visits, and Quebec Task 
Force diagnostic classifications of 1, 2, 3 or 7 were enrolled to receive four 
SM treatments over two weeks. Study outcomes were measured at the first and 
fifth visits with the examiners blinded from participant group assignment.
RESULTS: The LVVA-SM group demonstrated a significant increase in 
medial-to-lateral postural excursion on the soft surface at the first visit when 
compared to the control group. No other significant between-group differences 
were found for the two sensorimotor tests, whether during the first visit or 
over two weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: It appears that short-term SM does not affect the sensorimotor 
functions as measured by postural sway and response to sudden load in this 
study.

BACKGROUND: How metastatic cancer initially presents is largely unknown.
AIM: To identify clinical features of metastatic cancer in primary care.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-control study in 11 general practices in Devon, UK.
METHOD: Cases of patients who had died with metastatic breast, colorectal, or 
prostate cancer were selected. In addition, two control groups were formed of 
patients with the same primary cancer but without metastases ('cancer controls') 
and patients without cancer ('healthy controls'), matched for age, sex, and 
practice. All symptoms, signs, and laboratory test abnormalities in the year 
before metastasis were identified. The primary analysis used conditional 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: In total, 162 cases, 152 cancer controls, and 145 healthy controls were 
studied. Common symptoms associated with cancer were: vomiting, 40 (25%) cases 
and 13 (9%) cancer controls (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 1.3 to 9.4, P = 0.011); low back pain, 38 (24%) cases and 17 
(11%) cancer controls (OR 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.6, P = 0.032); loss of 
appetite, 32 (20%) cases and nine (6%) cancer controls (OR 4.0, 95% CI = 1.2 to 
13.2, P = 0.021); and shoulder pain, 27 (17%) cases and eight (5%) cancer 
controls (OR 5.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 18, P = 0.007). Groin pain was uncommon, but 
strongly associated (16 [10%] cases and one [1%] cancer control [OR 10, 95% CI = 
1.2 to 82, P = 0.032]), as was pleural disease (nine [6%] cases and one [1%] 
cancer control [OR 10, 95% CI = 1.1 to 92, P = 0.038]).
CONCLUSION: These features of disseminated cancer have been reported before in 
studies from secondary care, but the scarcity of specific symptoms (such as 
local pain) and the fairly common occurrence of non-specific symptoms (vomiting 
and loss of appetite) is important and may explain delays in the diagnosis of 
metastases.

PURPOSE: This population-based cohort study investigated the association between 
a lifetime history of a work-related low back injury, in those who had recovered 
to have no or mild low back pain, and the development of troublesome low back 
pain (LBP). A secondary analysis explored the possible effects of 
misclassification of the exposure by examining the association between a 
lifetime history of having taken time off work or performed light duties at work 
because of a work-related low back injury. Current evidence from cross-sectional 
studies suggests that individuals with a history of a work-related low back 
injury are more likely to experience future LBP. However, there is a need to 
examine this association prospectively in a large population-based cohort with 
adequate control of known confounders.
METHODS: We formed a cohort of 810 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults with no 
or mild LBP in September 1995. At baseline, participants were asked if they had 
ever injured their low back at work. The secondary analysis asked if they had 
ever had to take time off work or perform light duties at work because of a 
work-related low back injury. Prospective follow-up 6 and 12 months later, asked 
about the presence of troublesome LBP (grade II-IV) on the Chronic Pain Grade 
Questionnaire. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was 
used to estimate these associations while controlling for known confounders.
RESULTS: The proportion followed up at 6 and 12 months was 76 and 65%, 
respectively. We found an association between a history of work-related low back 
injury and the onset of troublesome LBP after controlling for gender (adjusted 
HRR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.41-3.56). When covariates that may also be mediators of the 
association were added to the model, the effect estimate was attenuated 
(adjusted HRR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.41-3.56). We found a similar association between 
a lifetime history of having taken time off work or had to work light duties at 
work because of a work-related low back injury, adjusted for gender (adjusted 
HRR = 2.31; 95% CI 1.39-3.85) which was also diluted by the further adjustment 
for covariates that may also be mediators of the association (adjusted HRR = 
1.80; 95% CI 1.08-3.01).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a history of work-related low back injury or 
taking time off work or having to perform light duties at work due to a 
work-related low back injury may be a risk factor for the development of 
troublesome LBP. Residual confounding may account for some of the observed 
associations, but this was less in the group who took time off work or had to 
work light duties due to a work-related low back injury.

INTRODUCTION: In degenerative adult spinal deformity (ASD), sagittal 
malalignment and rotatory subluxation (RS) correlate with clinical 
symptomatology. RS is defined as axial rotation with lateral listhesis. 
Stereoradiography, recently developed for medical applications, provides 
full-body standing radiographs and 3D reconstruction of the spine, with low 
radiation dose.
HYPOTHESIS: 3D stereoradiography improves analysis of RS and of its relations 
with transverse plane and spinopelvic parameters and clinical impact.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty adults with lumbar ASD and 
full-spine EOS® radiographs (EOS Imaging, Paris, France) were included. 
Spinopelvic sagittal parameters and lateral listhesis in the coronal plane were 
measured. The transverse plane study parameters were: apical axial vertebral 
rotation (apex AVR), axial intervertebral rotation (AIR) and torsion index (TI). 
Two groups were compared: with RS (lateral listhesis>5mm) and without RS 
(without lateral listhesis exceeding 5mm: non-RS). Correlations between 
radiologic and clinical data were assessed.
RESULTS: RS patients were significantly older, with larger Cobb angle (37.4° vs. 
26.6°, P=0.0001), more severe sagittal deformity, and greater apex AVR and TI 
(respectively: 22.9° vs. 11.3°, P<0.001; and 41.0° vs. 19.9°, P<0.001). Ten 
percent of patients had AIR>10° without visible RS on 2D radiographs. RS 
patients reported significantly more frequent low back pain and radiculalgia.
DISCUSSION: In this EOS® study, ASD patients with RS had greater coronal 
curvature and sagittal and transverse deformity, as well as greater pain. 
Further transverse plane analysis could allow earlier diagnosis and prognosis to 
guide management.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4, retrospective study.

Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress in Patients With Modic Changes: Preliminary 
Controlled Study.

Medicine, Sutcu Imam University, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.

STUDY DESIGN: Oxidative/nitrosative stress in vertebral endplates of patients 
with low back pain and Modic changes (MCs) (types I, II, and III) endplate 
changes on magnetic resonance imaging.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the levels of 
oxidative/nitrosative stress biomarkers in patients with MCs.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Degenerated discs and endplate abnormalities is 
postulated as a possible source of low back pain. Oxidative/nitrosative stress 
plays an important the role in various human diseases. However, the presence of 
oxidative/nitrosative stress has not been studied in patients with low back pain 
and endplate changes on magnetic resonance imaging.
METHODS: Patients with MCI, II, and III (n = 32) and age- and sex-matched 
controls subjects (n = 15) were enrolled in this study. Also, 3-nitrotyrosine 
(3-NT) and nitric oxide levels as nitrosative stress biomarkers were measured 
with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Also, the activities of catalase (CAT) 
and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) as 
oxidative stress biomarkers were determined on spectrophotometer.
RESULTS: Oxidative/nitrosative stress was confirmed by the significant elevation 
in nitric oxide, 3-NT, MDA and decreased of CAT and SOD activities in MCI 
compared with other MCs and the control group (P < 0.05). The highest CAT and 
SOD activities were found in patients with MCII compared with the other MCs and 
the control group. However, the levels of nitric oxide, 3-NT, and MDA showed 
moderate increase in this group (P < 0.05). In addition, the levels of 
nitrosative stress biomarkers in patients with MCIII were approximated to the 
control values (P > 0.05). However, the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in 
patients with MCIII were slightly higher than that of the control group (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that oxidative/nitrosative stress in patients 
with MCI may be aggravated as a result of oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and it 
may cause formation of the lesion in these patients. However, the increased 
antioxidant activities and MDA, 3-NT levels in patients with MCII and MCIII may 
be an adaptative response to against oxidative/nitrosative stress.

Rheumatologists may need to establish the etiological diagnosis and handle the 
therapeutic management of adults with uveitis. To date, no diagnostic strategy 
for uveitis has been validated by prospective studies. Investigations are 
selected based on the clinical features and on the anatomic location of the 
ocular abnormalities. Infections such as syphilis, Lyme disease, tuberculosis, 
and Whipple's disease may cause uveitis, with concomitant joint inflammation in 
a few cases. In patients with a known history of chronic inflammatory joint 
disease, causes of uveitis include bisphosphonate therapy and 
immunodepression-related infections (e.g., due to Toxoplasma or a herpes virus). 
Sarcoidosis is an underestimated cause of uveitis, which occurs in 15% of cases, 
with a predilection for middle-aged women. In spondyloarthritis, uveitis is 
almost always acute, unilateral, and anterior. Among patients with uveitis and 
spondyloarthritis, about two thirds have their joint disease diagnosed during an 
evaluation for uveitis. Therefore, patients with inflammatory or noninflammatory 
back pain should be routinely evaluated for spondyloarthritis, which is the 
leading cause of uveitis in western countries. The risk of blindness is 
extremely low, and the main complication is recurrent uveitis, seen in 50% to 
60% of cases. Sulfasalazine decreases the frequency, duration, and severity of 
uveitis and can be used prophylactically.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Pediatric breast reduction mammaplasty is a procedure 
commonly performed in children suffering from excess breast tissue, back pain, 
and social anxiety. Minimal information exists regarding demographics, 
epidemiology, and complications in adolescents. As health care reform 
progresses, investigating the socioeconomic and patient-related factors 
affecting cost and operative outcomes is essential.
METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) was used from 2000 to 2009. Patients 
with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code of 
macromastia and procedure code of reduction mammaplasty 20 and less were 
included. Demographic data, including age, sex, payer mix, and location, were 
collected. Significant independent variables associated with complications and 
duration of stay were identified with bivariate and multiple regression 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1,345 patients between the ages 12 and 20 were evaluated. 
The majority of patients were white (64%), from a zip code with greatest income 
(36%), and had private insurance (75%). Overall comorbidity and complication 
rates were 30% and 3.2%, respectively. Duration of stay was associated with 
race, income quartile, insurance type, having complications, and hospital type. 
African-American race, Medicaid, lower income, and private-investor owned 
hospitals were predictive of greater hospital charges.
CONCLUSION: In this large retrospective database analysis, pediatric reduction 
mammaplasty had a relatively low early complication rate and short duration of 
stay. Complications, total charges, and duration of stay discrepancies were 
associated with race, location, and socioeconomic status. Although demonstrably 
safe, this is the first study demonstrating the negative effect of race and 
socioeconomic status on a completely elective procedure involving children. 
These results demonstrate the intricate association between socioeconomic and 
patient-related factors influencing overall outcomes in the pediatric 
population.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Modic changes (MC) are associated with low back pain. They 
represent vertebral endplate and adjacent vertebral marrow changes on magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), classified into three types. Because of small sample 
sizes, patient cohorts, and limited phenotype assessment, the morphology and 
involvement of MC and their association with other spinal phenotypes remain 
speculative.
PURPOSE: We addressed and proposed a phenotypic profiling of MC and their 
relationship with lumbar MRI phenotypes in a large-scale population-based study.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A cross-sectional study of the Hong Kong Disc Degeneration 
Cohort.
PATIENT SAMPLE: The study population consisted of 1,546 Southern Chinese 
volunteers.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Topographical and morphological dimensions of MC, presence of 
disc degeneration (DD) and displacement, and Schmorl nodes were evaluated.
METHODS: Axial T1-weighted and sagittal T2-weighted MRIs (3T) were assessed.
RESULTS: Females were 62.4% (mean age, 49 years). The overall prevalence of MC 
was 21.9% (6.3% Type I and 15.5% Type II). Of all MC, 76% were located at the 
two lowest lumbar levels. Modic changes at the two lowest lumbar levels were 
more commonly located laterally (p<.001), less commonly anteriorly (p<.001), and 
were more extensive horizontally (p=.006) but not in vertical height compared 
with the upper levels. Type I MC were less common in the anterior part (p=.022), 
larger in size (height p=.004), and affected more likely the whole horizontal 
plane (p=.016) than Type II MC. Modic changes were associated with disc 
displacement, Schmorl nodes, and DD at the affected level (all p<.001), and the 
strength of association increased with the size of the lesion. Type I MC were 
associated more strongly with disc displacement (p=.008) and DD (p=.022) than 
Type II MC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our large-scale MRI study is the first to definitely note that MC 
were size- and type-dependently significantly associated with disc pathology and 
endplate abnormalities. Our phenotype profiling of MC may have clinical utility.

OBJECTIVE: Surgical detethering is a traditional treatment for symptomatic 
tethered cord syndrome. However, such complications as cerebrospinal fluid 
leakage and neurologic deterioration are common. Homogeneous spinal-shortening 
axial decompression (HSAD) is a modified procedure of monosegmental 
spinal-shortening osteotomy and it is a novel surgical alternative of reducing 
neural tension indirectly. The objective was to evaluate the surgical outcomes 
of HSAD for tethered cord syndrome.
METHODS: The surgical outcomes were examined for 15 consecutive patients with 
tethered cord syndrome undergoing HSAD from April 2010 to July 2014. 
Improvements of neurological symptoms including urinary dysfunction, 
lower-extremity motor and sensory disturbances and/or gait abnormalities, 
low-back and/or lower-extremity pain, bowel incontinence and sexual dysfunction 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: Their average follow-up period was 21.5 months. The length of spinal 
column shortening was 17.2 ± 2.9 mm. Urinary dysfunction (n = 9) was the most 
common residual deficit. All 9 patients with urological symptoms reported 
improvements, although deficits persisted at the last follow-up. All patients 
with lower-extremity motor dysfunction improved and 4 (50.0%) noted complete 
resolution of preoperative lower-extremity sensory symptoms. All patients 
reported immediate low-back or lower-extremity pain relief after HSAD. One 
patient reported improved sexual functioning and regained complete erectile 
capabilities. Two patients (11%) experienced less satisfactory symptomatic or 
functional benefit from HSAD. However, the main objective of surgery was to 
prevent further worsening of neurological status. Complete bone union at 
osteotomy site was noted in all cases at the last follow-up.
CONCLUSION: As a novel surgical option for tethered cord syndrome, HSAD may 
avoid such complications as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or neurologic 
deterioration commonly encountered during traditional detethering surgery. All 
patients gain satisfactory functional outcomes without complications compared to 
their preoperative symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the available 
literature on structural and functional brain abnormalities in chronic low back 
pain (CLBP) using several brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.
METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science were systematically screened for relevant 
literature using different combinations of keywords regarding structural and 
functional brain imaging techniques in patients with CLBP. Reference lists of 
included articles were hand-searched for additional literature. Eligible 
articles were assessed on risk of bias and reviewed by two independent 
researchers.
RESULTS: The search query returned 27 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. 
Methodological quality varied from poor to good. A total of 10 studies evaluated 
structural gray matter changes. There is conflicting evidence in global gray 
matter changes, with both increases and decreases shown in different studies. 
Gray matter changes were demonstrated in specific brain regions. Structural 
white matter changes were reported in five studies. There is conflicting 
evidence in total white matter volume due to both increases and unchanged white 
matter. Several regional differences were identified in which white matter 
changes were shown. Functional organization during rest was evaluated in 10 
studies. CLBP patients showed increased activation in specific regions, together 
with a disrupted default mode network. A total of six studies evaluated brain 
activity in response to a nociceptive stimulus. Findings suggest that patients 
demonstrated increased activity in pain-related regions, and decreased activity 
in analgesic regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is moderate evidence for regional changes in gray 
and white matter, together with an altered functional connectivity during rest 
and increased activity in pain-related areas following painful stimulation, 
evidencing an upregulated pain matrix. More longitudinal research is needed to 
clarify the temporal relationship regarding pain and neuroplastic changes, and 
integration of different brain imaging techniques is warranted.

Recently several authors have reported that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) might 
provide a new understanding of sciatica. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the clinical feasibility of DTI for the evaluation of lumbar spinal 
nerve of patients with sciatica associated with lumbar degenerative disorders. 
Thirty-four patients (25men, mean age63. 3years) with degenerated lumbar 
disease, 14 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis with foraminal stenosis, 12 
with lumbar spinal stenosis without foraminal stenosis, five with lumbar disc 
herniation, two with discogenic low back pain, and one with spondylolysis who 
underwent 3.0T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and surgical treatment were 
included in the present study. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated from an 
FA map, and tractography was investigated. In asymptomatic nerves, tractography 
showed all L3-S1 spinal nerve roots clearly. Abnormalities of tractography were 
classified into three types by shape; "Disrupted", "Narrowing", and "Tapering". 
More abnormalities of tractography were found in patients with lumbar spinal 
stenosis, and especially in patients with foraminal stenosis. The disrupted type 
was the most common. The mean FA of entrapped symptomatic nerves was less than 
seen on the intact side. This study demonstrates that tractography shows 
abnormal findings for nerve roots in lumbar spinal degeneration and that FA 
decreases in symptomatic roots. DTI may offer not only morphological evaluation, 
but also quantitative evaluation. We believe that DTI can be used as a tool for 
the diagnosis of lumbar spinal degenerative disease.

University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.

The butterfly vertebral defect is a rare congenital anomaly of the spine, which 
is generally considered benign. In this report we present the case of an active 
young man who presented with recurrent low back pain (LBP), and was found to 
have a butterfly vertebral defect at the symptomatic L4 lumbar spinal level. We 
describe the genesis of the butterfly vertebral defect, in the context of normal 
embryological development of the human vertebra and intervertebral disk. We 
report the clinical examination findings and therapeutic interventions 
undertaken prior to the radiographic discovery of the vertebral defect, and 
discuss the impact that the presence of a butterfly vertebral defect presented 
to therapeutic decision-making.

Spondylolysis and Beyond: Value of SPECT/CT in Evaluation of Low Back Pain in 
Children and Young Adults.

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) is 
ideally suited for assessment of low back pain in children and young adults. 
Spondylolysis is one of the most common structural causes of low back pain and 
is readily identified and characterized in terms of its chronicity and 
likelihood to heal. The value of SPECT/CT extends to identification and 
characterization of other causes of low back pain, including abnormalities of 
the posterior elements, developing vertebral endplate, transverse processes, and 
sacrum and sacroiliac joint. Some of the disease processes that are identifiable 
at SPECT/CT are similar to those that occur in adults (eg, facet hypertrophy) 
but may be accelerated in young patients by high-level athletic activities. 
Other processes (eg, limbus vertebrae) are more unique to children, related to 
injury of the developing spine. The authors review the spectrum of pars 
interarticularis abnormalities with emphasis on the imaging features of causes 
of pediatric low back pain other than spondylolysis.

Tolerability of Biphasic-Release Hydrocodone Bitartrate/Acetaminophen Tablets 
(MNK-155): A Phase III, Multicenter, Open-Label Study in Patients With 
Osteoarthritis or Chronic Low Back Pain.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the tolerability of the extended use (≤35 
days) of MNK-155, a biphasic (immediate-release/extended-release) hydrocodone 
bitartrate/N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (acetaminophen) (IR/ER HB/APAP) 7.5/325-mg 
fixed-dose combination analgesic agent, in patients with chronic noncancer pain 
(CNCP) caused by osteoarthritis or chronic low back pain. IR/ER HB/APAP tablets 
deliver 25% of the HB dose and 50% of the APAP dose by IR and the remainder by 
ER over a 12-hour dosing interval. Although IR/ER HB/APAP is being developed for 
the management of moderate to severe acute pain, this model of CNCP was used for 
assessing tolerability over a term longer than would be possible in a model of 
acute pain.
METHODS: This Phase III, multicenter, open-label study enrolled patients with 
moderate to severe OA (knee or hip) pain despite the use of nonopioid or opioid 
analgesic agents, or with moderate to severe CLBP present for several hours per 
day for ≥3 months. Patients received a 3-tablet initial dose of IR/ER HB/APAP 
(total dose, 22.5/975 mg) on day 1, followed by 2 tablets of IR/ER HB/APAP 
(total dose, 15/650 mg) q12h for up to 35 days. Tolerability, the primary end 
point, was assessed using time to treatment discontinuation, the prevalence of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital sign measurements, pulse 
oximetry, clinical laboratory tests, and compliance. Secondary outcomes included 
the modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Arthritis Index, and The Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability 
Questionnaire.
FINDINGS: Of the 153 patients enrolled (95 women [62.1%]; mean age, 53.9 [14.5] 
years; OA, n = 73; CLBP, n = 80), 37 (24.2%) discontinued the study early (mean 
time to discontinuation, 21.3 days). Thirteen patients (8.5%) discontinued 
because of TEAEs. A total of 88 patients (57.5%) reported ≥1 TEAE, 65 (42.5%) of 
whom experienced AEs considered by the investigator as treatment related. The 
most frequent TEAEs were nausea (16.3%), somnolence (14.4%), and constipation 
(11.1%). Eight severe TEAEs were experienced by 6 (3.9%) patients and included 
single occurrences of nausea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, elevated liver enzymes, 
headache, nightmare, and ejaculation delay. No serious treatment-related AEs 
were reported. Clinically significant changes in laboratory values were reported 
in 13 patients, 6 of whom had abnormal liver function test results that did not 
meet Hy's law criteria for acute liver failure. Most laboratory abnormalities 
were mild and transient. Measures of pain intensity, function, and quality of 
life improved from baseline but in an open-label study these changes cannot be 
attributed to treatment.
IMPLICATIONS: The safety profile of IR/ER HB/APAP during extended use was 
consistent with those of other low-dose opioid/APAP combination products. IR/ER 
HB/APAP is intended for acute pain; its efficacy for relief of CNCP would 
require further evaluation in an active- or placebo-controlled study.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present retrospective study was to describe the 
clinical, radiological and bone characteristics of long-term survivors who have 
received radiotherapy involving some part of the vertebral column for certain 
childhood tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocentric descriptive study of a cohort of patients 
followed at Gustave-Roussy in the framework of long-term monitoring treated for 
a solid tumor in childhood with radiotherapy on part of the spine and having 
back pain and/or spinal deformity have been addressed in the Service of 
Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation at the Cochin Hospital. For each patient, were 
performed standardized radiographs of the entire spine and spinal MRI.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients were evaluated (average age of 35.4 ± 6.9 years; mean 
age at radiation therapy: 3.6 ± 2.8 years). Original tumors were nephroblastoma 
(9 cases), neuroblastoma (4 cases) and medulloblastoma (3 cases). Of the 15 
patients analyzed by X-rays of the entire spine, 67% (10/15) patients had 
scoliosis (2 with a Cobb angle > 20°), 73% (11/15) had an abnormal thoracic 
kyphosis, 67% (10/15) had abnormal lumbar lordosis. Of the 16 patients analyzed 
by MRI, 75% (12/16) had discopathies or anomalies of the discal plate, 63% 
(10/16) had mild abnormalities of bone marrow. Muscle abnormalities were common 
(81%, 13/16).
CONCLUSION: The main risk factors of spinal deformities are intraductal tumor, 
spinal surgery, spinal radiotherapy and a young age at the time of the cancer. 
These cured children require dedicated monitoring. Currently, this risk is 
reduced with the actual techniques of radiotherapy.

Rapidly Progressive Seeding of a Community Acquired Pathogen in an 
Immune-competent Host--End Organ Damage from Head to Bone.

Torres-Miranda D, Al-Saffar F, Ibrahim S, Font-Diaz S.

This report describes a 64-years-old male patient that presented to our hospital 
with a chief complaint of acute worsening of his usual chronic lower back pain, 
progressive weakness in lower extremities and subjective fevers at home. Spine 
CT failed to demonstrate any infectious foci but showed partially visualized 
lung cavitary lesion and renal pole abnormalities. Blood cultures grew 
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (MSSA). Transthoracic echocardiogram 
(TTE) showed no signs of infective endocarditis (IE). Later, the patient 
experienced an acute deterioration on clinical status and examination showed 
development of a new murmur. He also developed new hemiparesis with up-going 
babinski reflex. A head MRI showed multiple infarcts. MRI spine displayed 
osteomyelitis at T12-L1. Cerebro-spinal fluid was positive for meningitis. A 
transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed demonstrating new severe 
mitral and mild tricuspid regurgitations with a definitive 1.5 cm mobile 
vegetation on posterior mitral leaflet. We present is a very interesting case of 
a rapidly progressive MSSA infection. MSSA meningitis is a rare disease; there 
are only few reported cases in the literature to date. We describe a case of 
MSSA bacteremia, of questionable source, that resulted in MSSA endocarditis 
affecting right and left heart in a patient who did not have a history of 
intravenous drug use (IVDU) or immunosuppression. The case was complicated by 
septic emboli to systemic circulation involving the kidneys, vertebral spine 
(osteomyelitis), lungs and brain with consequent meningitis and stroke. Even 
when MSSA infections are well known, to our knowledge there are no previous case 
reports describing such an acute-simultaneous-manifestation of multi-end-organ 
failure, including meningitis and stroke. These latter are rarely reported, even 
individually.

BACKGROUND: Excessive lumbar vertebrae translation and rotation in sagittal 
plane has been attributed as an associated factor of lumbar segmental 
instability (LSI) and low back pain (LBP). Reduction of these abnormalities 
improves back pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of core 
stability exercise on the translation and rotation of lumbar vertebrae in 
sagittal plane in patients with nonspecific chronic LBP (NSCLBP).
METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 30 patients with NSCLBP due to LSI 
were included. The participants were randomly divided into two groups of 
treatment and control. The treatment group received general exercises plus core 
stability exercise for 8 weeks whereas; the control group received only general 
exercises. The magnitude of translation (mm) and rotation (deg) of lumbar 
vertebrae in the sagittal plane was determined by radiography in flexion and 
extension at baseline and after intervention. The primary outcome measures were 
to determine the mean changes from baseline in translation and rotation of the 
lumbar vertebrae in the sagittal plane after 8 weeks of intervention in each 
group. The secondary outcome was to compare the two groups in regard to 
translation and rotation of the lumbar vertebrae at the end of the study period. 
Data were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test.
RESULTS: Thirty patients aged 18-40 years old with clinical diagnosis of NSCLBP 
entered the study. Compared with baseline values, mean value of translation and 
rotation of the lumbar vertebra reduced significantly in both groups (P<0.05), 
except L3 translation in the control group. At the endpoint, mean translation 
value of L4 (P=0.04) and L5 (P=0.001) and rotation of the L5 (P=0.01) in the 
treatment group was significantly lower than the control group.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that in patients presented with NSCLBP due 
to lumbar segmental instability, core stability exercises plus general exercises 
are more efficient than general exercises alone in the improvement of excessive 
lumbar vertebrae translation and rotation.

Reliability of the Path of the Sciatic Nerve, Congruence between Patients' 
History and Medical Imaging Evidence of Disc Herniation and Its Role in Surgical 
Decision Making.

Germany.

STUDY DESIGN: The prevalence of disc herniation is estimated to be about 100,000 
new cases per year in France and disc herniation accounts for 25% to 30% of 
surgical activity in Departments of Neurosurgery. Classically, sciatica is 
expected to follow its specific dermatome-L5 or S1-. In clinical practice, we 
regularly encounter patients showing discrepancy between clinical sciatica and 
imaging findings.
PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to review the medical concept and management 
of sciatica pain in patients showing this discrepancy.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: To the best of our knowledge, this subject has not yet 
been discussed in the medical literature.
METHODS: The medical records of 241 patients who were operated on for L5 or S1 
sciatica caused by disc herniation were reviewed.
RESULTS: We found an apparent clinicoradiological discrepancy between sciatica 
described by patients on one side and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding 
on the other side in 27 (11.20%) patients. We did not find any other 
abnormalities in the preoperative and postoperative period. All of these 
patients underwent lumbar discectomy via posterior interlaminar approach. Three 
months after surgery, 25 patients (92.59%) had been totally relieved of sciatica 
pain. Two patients (7.41%) continued to experience sciatica in spite of the 
surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancy between clinical sciatica and disc herniation level 
on MRI is not rare. Management of this discrepancy requires further 
investigation in order to avoid missing the diagnosis and treatment failure.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) for the management of neck pain and associated disorders (NAD), 
whiplash-associated disorders, and non-specific low back pain (LBP) with or 
without radiculopathy.
METHODS: We systematically searched six databases from 2000 to 2014. Random 
pairs of independent reviewers critically appraised eligible systematic reviews 
using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. We included 
systematic reviews with a low risk of bias in our best evidence synthesis.
RESULTS: We screened 706 citations and 14 systematic reviews were eligible for 
critical appraisal. Eight systematic reviews had a low risk of bias. For 
recent-onset NAD, evidence suggests that intramuscular NSAIDs lead to similar 
outcomes as combined manipulation and soft tissue therapy. For NAD (duration not 
specified), oral NSAIDs may be more effective than placebo. For recent-onset 
LBP, evidence suggests that: (1) oral NSAIDs lead to similar outcomes to placebo 
or a muscle relaxant; and (2) oral NSAIDs with bed rest lead to similar outcomes 
as placebo with bed rest. For persistent LBP, evidence suggests that: (1) oral 
NSAIDs are more effective than placebo; and (2) oral NSAIDs may be more 
effective than acetaminophen. For recent-onset LBP with radiculopathy, there is 
inconsistent evidence on the effectiveness of oral NSAIDs versus placebo. 
Finally, different oral NSAIDs lead to similar outcomes for neck and LBP with or 
without radiculopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: For NAD, oral NSAIDs may be more effective than placebo. Oral 
NSAIDs are more effective than placebo for persistent LBP, but not for 
recent-onset LBP. Different oral NSAIDs lead to similar outcomes for neck pain 
and LBP.

and Neurosurgery (IL) of Stradins University Hospital, Riga, Latvia, and the 
Department of Anesthesiology, Orthopedic University Hospital Balgrist, Zürich, 
Switzerland (AB).

BACKGROUND: Epidural steroid injections are routinely performed under 
fluoroscopic guidance, but could also be performed using preprocedure ultrasound 
spine examination.
OBJECTIVES: To compare ultrasound-assisted and fluoroscopy-controlled epidural 
steroid injections with regard to technical feasibility (accuracy, average 
procedure time) and outcome (pain relief and degree of disability score).
DESIGN: A randomised study.
SETTING: University hospital between January 2010 and September 2012.
PATIENTS: One hundred and twelve patients with axial chronic lower back and 
extremity pain diagnosed with degenerative diseases of the spine, receiving 
three lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections, were randomly assigned 
between two groups.
INTERVENTION: In the fluoroscopic group, injections were performed under 
fluoroscopic guidance, and in the ultrasound group, ultrasound scanning of the 
lumbar spine was performed before the injection to determine the puncture site, 
depth of the epidural space and needle trajectory.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Procedure time, numbers of needle insertion attempts and 
needle passes, visual analogue scale for pain and Oswestry disability index at 1 
and 3 months posttreatment.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in mean 
procedure time, number of needle insertion attempts or needle passes. The mean 
pain intensity and degree of disability scores before the procedure, and at 1 
and 3 months postprocedure, were similar in the two groups. Neither group had 
serious complications.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasound-assisted epidural 
steroid injections.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain and disability are major public health 
problems and may be related to paraspinal muscle abnormalities, such as a 
reduction in muscle size and muscle fat content.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the associations between 
paraspinal muscle size and fat content with lumbar spine symptoms and structure.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This was a community-based magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) cohort study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 72 adults not selected on the basis of low back pain 
were included in the study.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes measured were lumbar modic change and 
intervertebral disc height. Pain intensity and disability were measured from the 
Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire at the time of MRI.
METHODS: The cross-sectional area (CSA) and amount of fat in multifidus and 
erector spinae (high percentage defined by >50% of muscle) were measured, and 
their association with outcome was assessed.
RESULTS: Muscle CSA was not associated with low back pain/disability or 
structure. High percentage of fat in multifidus was associated with an increased 
risk of high-intensity pain/disability (odds ratio [OR], 12.6; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 2.0-78.3; p=.007) and modic change (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.1-17.3; 
p=.04). High fat replacement of erector spinae was associated with reduced 
intervertebral disc height (β=-0.9 mm; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.3; p=.002) and modic 
change (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.1-21.9; p=.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Paraspinal fat infiltration, but not muscle CSA, was associated 
with high-intensity pain/disability and structural abnormalities in the lumbar 
spine. Although cause and effect cannot be determined from this cross-sectional 
study, longitudinal data will help to determine whether disabling low back pain 
and structural abnormalities of the spine are a cause or result of fat 
replacement of paraspinal muscles.

Hemolymphangioma is a malformation of the lymphatic and blood vessels. To the 
best of our knowledge, only a limited number of hemolymphangioma cases have been 
reported in the literature thus far, with no cases developed in the waist 
region. The present study reported the case of a 17-year-old male patient with 
hemolymphangioma growing on the waist, presented with back pain for four months. 
Upon physical examination, the lesion was identified to be oval in shape, soft 
and compressible, with mild tenderness. No abnormalities were detected in the 
results of laboratory examinations. However, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scan revealed a tumor with low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (WI) and 
high signal intensity on T2-WI. The mass was successfully removed during 
surgery. During the seven-month follow-up period, the patient was asymptomatic 
with no evidence of recurrence. The present study discussed the imaging findings 
and pathological features of this uncommon case and reviewed the relevant 
literature.

Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) is a rare hereditary cerebral artery disease. The 
HtrA serine protease 1 (HTRA1) gene has been identified as the causative gene of 
CARASIL. Here, we report a novel mutation in the HTRA1 gene in a CARASIL 
pedigree and explore its pathogenesis at the protein level. Subcutaneous tissue 
biopsy and HTRA1 gene analysis were performed in a CARASIL patient, and HTRA1 
and TGF-β1 protein expression in subcutaneous tissue and cultured fibroblasts 
from the proband were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. A 
28-year-old male proband and his brother experienced recurrent stroke, hair loss 
and low back pain. Abnormalities in the proband were found in the elastic plate 
of subcutaneous small arteries, and a novel homozygous frameshift mutation 
(c.161_162insAG), leading to the formation of a stop codon 159 amino acids 
downstream of the insertion (p.Gly56Alafs*160) was detected. Reduced HTRA1 
protein and increased TGF-β1 expression were detected in subcutaneous tissue and 
in cultured fibroblasts. A frameshift mutation in the HTRA1 gene detected in a 
CARASIL pedigree resulted in reduced HTRA1 protein and increased TGF-β1 
expression, which may cause severe CARASIL and peripheral small arterial 
disease.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report is to describe chiropractic 
management of an elderly man with untreated bilateral hip joint dysplasia 
presenting with mild acute mechanical low back pain.
CLINICAL FEATURES: A 75-year-old man presented with an insidious-onset 
intermittent low back pain of 3 days' duration. Physical examination findings 
supported a mechanical cause for mild acute low back pain. Plain radiography 
revealed dysplasia of hip joints with absence of femoral heads and necks and 
bilateral high dislocation.
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Chiropractic management included vibration, 
mobilization, light drop-piece adjustments of the lower lumbar and sacroiliac 
joints, and recommendation of the use of heat at home. Treatments were given 3 
times over the course of 1 week. The low back pain intensity over this period 
dropped from 5 to 0 on an 11-point numerical rating scale, and the patient was 
discharged.
CONCLUSION: This patient with substantial postural and gait abnormalities as a 
result of severe bilateral hip dysplasia associated with an unusual pattern of 
osteoarthritic change in the spine responded favorably to a short course of 
chiropractic care.

OBJECT Patient outcome measures are becoming increasingly important in the 
evaluation of health care quality and physician performance. Of the many novel 
measures currently being explored, patient satisfaction and other subjective 
measures of patient experience are among the most heavily weighted. However, 
these subjective measures are strongly influenced by a number of factors, 
including patient demographics, level of understanding of the disorder and its 
treatment, and patient expectations. In the present study, patients referred to 
a neurosurgery clinic for degenerative spinal disorders were surveyed to 
determine their understanding of lumbar spondylosis diagnosis and treatment. 
METHODS A multiple-choice, 6-question survey was distributed to all patients 
referred to a general neurosurgical spine clinic at a tertiary care center over 
a period of 11 months as a quality improvement initiative to assist the provider 
with individualized patient counseling. The survey consisted of questions 
designed to assess patient understanding of the role of radiological imaging in 
the diagnosis and treatment of low-back and leg pain, and patient perception of 
the indications for surgical compared with conservative management. Demographic 
data were also collected. RESULTS A total of 121 surveys were included in the 
analysis. More than 50% of the patients indicated that they would undergo spine 
surgery based on abnormalities found on MRI, even without symptoms; more than 
40% of patients indicated the same for plain radiographs. Similarly, a large 
proportion of patients (33%) believed that back surgery was more effective than 
physical therapy in the treatment of back pain without leg pain. Nearly 
one-fifth of the survey group (17%) also believed that back injections were 
riskier than back surgery. There were no significant differences in survey 
responses among patients with a previous history of spine surgery compared with 
those without previous spine surgery. CONCLUSIONS These results show that a 
surprisingly high percentage of patients have misconceptions regarding the 
diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spondylosis, and that these misconceptions 
persist in patients with a history of spine surgery. Specifically, patients 
overemphasize the value of radiological studies and have mixed perceptions of 
the relative risk and effectiveness of surgical intervention compared with more 
conservative management. These misconceptions have the potential to alter 
patient expectations and decrease satisfaction, which could negatively impact 
patient outcomes and subjective valuations of physician performance. While these 
results are preliminary, they highlight a need for improved communication and 
patient education during surgical consultation for lumbar spondylosis.

BACKGROUND: Traffic collisions often result in a wide range of symptoms included 
in the umbrella term whiplash-associated disorders. Mid-back pain (MBP) is one 
of these symptoms. The incidence and prognosis of different traffic injuries and 
their related conditions (e.g. neck pain, low back pain, depression or others) 
has been investigated previously; however, knowledge about traffic 
collision-related MBP is lacking. The study objectives were to describe the 
incidence, course of recovery and prognosis of MBP after traffic collisions, in 
terms of global self-reported recovery.
METHODS: Longitudinal data from a population-based inception cohort of all 
traffic injuries occurring in Saskatchewan, Canada, during a 2-year period were 
used. Annual overall and age-sex-specific incidence rates were calculated, the 
course of recovery was described using the Kaplan-Meier technique, and 
associations between participant characteristics and time-to-self-reported 
recovery were explored in 3496 MBP cases using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: The yearly incidence rate was 236 per 100,000 population during the 
study period, and was highest in women and in young persons. The median 
time-to-first reported recovery was 101 days (95% CI: 99-104) and about 23% were 
still not recovered after 1 year. Participant's expectation for recovery, 
general health, extent of severely affecting comorbidities and having 
experienced a previous traffic injury were some of the prognostic factors 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that MBP is common after traffic collisions, 
may result in a long recovery process and that a range of biopsychosocial 
factors are associated with recovery.

The spinal pain, and expecially the low back pain (LBP), represents the second 
cause for a medical consultation in primary care setting and a leading cause of 
disability worldwide [1]. LBP is more often idiopathic. It has as most frequent 
cause the internal disc disruption (IDD) and is referred to as discogenic pain. 
IDD refers to annular fissures, disc collapse and mechanical failure, with no 
significant modification of external disc shape, with or without endplates 
changes. IDD is described as a separate clinical entity in respect to disc 
herniation, segmental instability and degenerative disc desease (DDD). The 
radicular pain has as most frequent causes a disc herniation and a canal 
stenosis. Both discogenic and radicular pain also have either a mechanical and 
an inflammatory genesis. For to be richly innervated, facet joints can be a 
direct source of pain, while for their degenerative changes cause compression of 
nerve roots in lateral recesses and in the neural foramina. Degenerative 
instability is a common and often misdiagnosed cause of axial and radicular 
pain, being also a frequent indication for surgery. Acute pain tends to 
extinguish along with its cause, but the setting of complex processes of 
peripheral and central sensitization may influence its evolution in chronic 
pain, much more difficult to treat. The clinical assessment of pain source can 
be a challenge because of the complex anatomy and function of the spine; the 
advanced imaging methods are often not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis 
because similar findings could be present in either asymptomatic and symptomatic 
subjects: a clinical correlation is always mandatory and the therapy cannot rely 
uniquely upon any imaging abnormalities. Purpose of this review is to address 
the current concepts on the pathophysiology of discogenic, radicular, facet and 
dysfunctional pain, focusing on the role of the imaging in the diagnostic 
setting, to potentially address a correct approach also to minimally invasive 
interventional techniques. Special attention will be done to the discogenic 
pain, actually considered as the most frequent cause of chronic low back pain.

in pregnancy?

BACKGROUND: Sacral stress fracture during pregnancy is an uncommon condition 
with unclear pathophysiology, presenting with non-specific symptoms and clinical 
findings. To date, few cases have been published in the literature describing 
the occurrence of sacral stress fracture during pregnancy.
CASE REPORT: We report a 28-year-old primigravid patient who developed 
lumbosacral pain at the end of the second trimester. Symptoms were overlooked 
throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, resulting in the development of 
secondary chronic gait and balance problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Stress fracture of the sacrum should be included in the 
differential diagnosis of low back and sacral pain during pregnancy. Its 
prevalence is probably underestimated because of the lack of specificity of the 
symptoms. Plain radiographs are not appropriate due to radiation exclusion; 
magnetic resonance is the only method that can be applied safely. There is 
limited information on natural history but many patients are expected to have a 
benign course. However, misdiagnosis may lead to prolonged morbidity and the 
development of secondary gait abnormalities. Stress fracture of the sacrum 
should be included in the differential diagnosis of low back and sacral pain 
during pregnancy. A high index of suspicion is necessary to establish an early 
diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) is a congenital anomaly of the 
lumbosacral junction. The association between back pain and LSTV is 
controversial; however, in our patient the symptoms localized to a 
hemisacralized left transverse process of L5. LSTV should be included in the 
differential diagnosis in young patients with lower back pain, and scintigraphic 
imaging should be considered for diagnostic purposes.

neuropsychiatric syndrome: presenting characteristics of the first 47 
consecutive patients.

Hospital, Stanford University School of Medicine , Palo Alto, California.

BACKGROUND: Abrupt, dramatic onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or 
eating restriction with at least two coinciding symptoms (anxiety, mood 
dysregulation, irritability/aggression/oppositionality, behavioral regression, 
cognitive deterioration, sensory or motor abnormalities, or somatic symptoms) 
defines pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). Descriptions of 
clinical data in such youth are limited.
METHODS: We reviewed charts of 53 consecutive patients evaluated in our PANS 
Clinic; 47 met PANS symptom criteria but not all met the requirement for "acute 
onset." Patients meeting full criteria for PANS were compared with patients who 
had a subacute/insidious onset of symptoms.
RESULTS: Nineteen of 47 (40%) patients in the study had acute onset of symptoms. 
In these patients, autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and psychiatric disorders 
were common in first-degree family members (71% and 78%, respectively). Most 
acute-onset patients had a relapsing/remitting course (84%), prominent sleep 
disturbances (84%), urinary issues (58%), sensory amplification (66%), 
gastrointestinal symptoms (42%), and generalized pain (68%). Inflammatory back 
pain (21%) and other arthritis conditions (28%) were also common. Suicidal and 
homicidal thoughts and gestures were common (44% and 17%, respectively) as were 
violent outbursts (61%). Group A streptococcus (GAS) was the most commonly 
identified infection at onset (21%) and during flares (74%). Rates of the 
above-mentioned characteristics did not differ between the acute-onset group and 
the subacute/insidious-onset groups. Low levels of immunoglobulins were more 
common in the subacute/insidious-onset group (75%) compared with the acute-onset 
group (22%), but this was not statistically significant (p=0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: In our PANS clinic, 40% of patients had acute onset of symptoms. 
However, those with and without acute onset of symptoms had similar symptom 
presentation, rates of inflammatory conditions, somatic symptoms, and violent 
thoughts and behaviors. GAS infections were the most commonly identified 
infection at onset and at symptom flares. Because of the wide variety of medical 
and psychiatric symptoms, youth with PANS may require a multidisciplinary team 
for adequate care management.

Intraoperative direct puncture and embolization (IOPE) using a glue material for 
spinal cord arteriovenous fistula: a case report.

College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

INTRODUCTION: Spinal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is treated by embolization or 
surgery. However, transarterial embolization or surgery is difficult in rare 
cases when the fistula site is very complicated to access especially as in 
fistular nidus supplied by posterior and anterior spinal artery. We present the 
case which was treated with intraoperative direct puncture and embolization 
(IOPE) using glue material, since the usual transarterial or transvenous 
neurointerventional approach was difficult to embolize the AVF.
METHODS: A 36-year-old woman presented with progressive leg weakness and pain 
after a 20-year history of lower back pain. She had pelvic and spinal AVF 
combined with arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Despite prior treatment of the 
pelvic lesion with radiotherapy and coil embolization, the spinal lesion 
persisted and caused repeated subarachnoid hemorrhages. A spinal angiogram 
revealed a tortuous and long feeder of the AVF which had growing venous sac, as 
well as AVM. Two embolization trials failed because of the long tortuosity and 
associated anterior spinal artery. Four months later, drastic leg weakness and 
pain occurred, and IOPE was performed using a glue material.
RESULTS: The subsequent recovery of the patient was rapid. One month later, the 
use of a strong opioid could be discontinued, and the patient could walk with 
aid. A follow-up spinal angiogram revealed that the venous sac of the AVF had 
disappeared.
CONCLUSION: In spinal AVF which is not feasible to access by usual intervention 
approach and to dissect surgically, IOPE with glue material can be considered 
for the treatment.

BACKGROUND: Patients with myeloma experience the longest diagnostic delays 
compared with patients with other cancers in the UK; 37% are diagnosed through 
emergency presentations.
AIM: To identify and quantify the risk of myeloma from specific clinical 
features reported by primary care patients.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Matched case-control study using General Practice Research 
Database primary care electronic records.
METHOD: Putative clinical features of myeloma were identified and analysed using 
conditional logistic regression. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were 
calculated for the consulting population.
RESULTS: A total of 2703 patients aged ≥40 years, diagnosed with myeloma between 
2000 and 2009, and 12 157 age, sex, and general practice-matched controls were 
identified. Sixteen features were independently associated with myeloma: 
hypercalcaemia, odds ratio 11.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.1 to 18), 
cytopenia 5.4 (95% CI = 4.6 to 6.4), raised inflammatory markers 4.9 (95% CI = 
4.2 to 5.8), fracture 3.1 (95% CI = 2.3 to 4.2), raised mean corpuscular volume 
3.1 (95% CI = 2.4 to 4.1), weight loss 3.0 (95% CI = 2.0 to 4.5), nosebleeds 3.0 
(95% CI = 1.9 to 4.7), rib pain 2.5 (95% CI = 1.5 to 4.4), back pain 2.2 (95% CI 
= 2.0 to 2.4), other bone pain 2.1 (95% CI = 1.4 to 3.1), raised creatinine 1.8 
(95% CI = 1.5 to 2.2), chest pain 1.6 (95% CI = 1.4 to 1.8), joint pain 1.6 (95% 
CI = 1.2 to 2.2), nausea 1.5 (95% CI = 1.1 to 2.1), chest infection 1.4 (95% CI 
= 1.2 to 1.6), and shortness of breath 1.3 (95% CI = 1.1 to 1.5). Individual 
symptom PPVs were generally <1%, although were >10% for some symptoms when 
combined with leucopenia or hypercalcaemia.
CONCLUSION: Individual symptoms of myeloma in primary care are generally low 
risk, probably explaining diagnostic delays. Once simple primary care blood 
tests are taken, risk estimates change. Hypercalcaemia and leucopenia are 
particularly important abnormalities, and coupled with symptoms, strongly 
suggest myeloma.

Infectious abdominal aortic aneurysms often present with abdominal and lower 
back pain, but prolonged fever may be the only symptom. Infectious abdominal 
aortic aneurysms initially presenting with meningitis are extremely rare; there 
are no reports of their successful treatment. Cases with Streptococcus 
pneumoniae as the causative bacteria are even rarer with a higher mortality rate 
than those caused by other bacteria. We present the case of a 65-year-old man 
with lower limb weakness and back pain. Examination revealed fever and neck 
stiffness. Cerebrospinal fluid showed leukocytosis and low glucose levels. The 
patient was diagnosed with meningitis and bacteremia caused by Streptococcus 
pneumoniae and treated with antibiotics. Fever, inflammatory response, and 
neurologic findings showed improvement. However, abdominal computed tomography 
revealed an aneurysm not present on admission. Antibiotics were continued, and a 
rifampicin soaked artificial vascular graft was implanted. Tissue cultures 
showed no bacteria, and histological findings indicated inflammation with high 
leukocyte levels. There were no postoperative complications or neurologic 
abnormalities. Physical examination, blood tests, and computed tomography 
confirmed there was no relapse over the following 13 months. This is the first 
reported case of survival of a patient with an infectious abdominal aortic 
aneurysm initially presenting with meningitis caused by Streptococcus 
pneumoniae.

REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: Review question: which extrinsic and intrinsic 
factors are associated with non-contact injury in adult cricket pace 
bowlers?Review objective: the objective of this review is to determine the 
extrinsic and intrinsic factors associated with non-contact injury in adult pace 
bowlers.
BACKGROUND: Cricket is generally considered to be a sport of low injury risk 
compared to other sports. In cricket, the pace bowler strives towards the 
adoption of a bowling technique with a relatively low injury threat that will, 
at the same time, allow for a fast (>120km/hr) and accurate delivery to the 
opposing batsman. However, of all the various roles of the cricket player, the 
pace bowler has the highest risk of injury, especially for low back and lower 
limb (lower quarter) injury. The reason for this high risk of injury is due to 
the inherent, high-load biomechanical nature of the pace bowling action. The 
high prevalence of injury amongst pace bowlers highlights the great need for 
research into factors associated with injury.Both extrinsic and intrinsic 
factors work in combination to predispose the bowler to injury. Extrinsic or 
environment-related factors include bowling workload (the numbers of overs a 
bowler bowls), player position (first, second or third change) and time of play 
(morning or afternoon). A high bowling workload has been linked with a higher 
risk of injury in pace bowlers. Foster et al. found in an observational study 
that bowling too many overs in a single spell or bowling too many spells may 
increase the pace bowler's risk of sustaining a low back injury. In another 
observational study, Dennis et al. found that an exceptionally high bowling 
workload as well as an uncommonly low bowling workload is associated with injury 
risk. The major extrinsic factors for bowling injury identified by Orchard et 
al. are a high number of match overs bowled in the previous week, number of days 
of play and bowling second (batting first) in a match. Extrinsic factors are 
known to make the bowler more susceptible to injury, especially in the presence 
of intrinsic factors.Intrinsic, or person-related, factors include muscle 
strength, flexibility, balance and biomechanics. Intrinsic, strength-related 
factors, such as shoulder depression, horizontal flexion strength for the 
preferred limb and quadriceps power in the non-preferred limb are also 
significantly related to back injuries in fast bowlers. Both upper limb and 
lower limb-related intrinsic factors are known to be associated with injury. A 
prospective study by Dennis et al. aimed to identify the risk factors for injury 
in adolescent cricket fast bowlers. Their findings concluded that bowlers with a 
hip internal rotation range of motion of ≤30° on the leg ipsilateral to the 
bowling arm were at a significantly reduced risk of injury compared with bowlers 
with >40° of rotation. Moreover, bowlers with ankle dorsiflexion lunge of 
12.1-14.0 cm on the leg contralateral to the bowling arm were at a significantly 
increased risk of injury compared to bowlers with a lunge of >14 cm. Reduced 
hamstring flexibility was also associated with lumbar disc abnormalities. 
Bowling-related biomechanical risk factors for injury have been established such 
as trunk rotation of the shoulders by to a more side-on position during the 
delivery stride. Portus et al. also reported that shoulder counter-rotation was 
significantly higher in bowlers who reported lumbar spine stress fractures, 
while the non-trunk injured group displayed a more flexed knee at front foot 
contact and ball release. In addition to the above kinematic risk factors, there 
are high ground reaction forces associated with the power phase - between the 
front foot placement and ball release components of the pace bowling action. A 
combination of kinematic bowling related issues as described above and high 
ground reaction forces may predispose the bowler to injury.Morton et al. 
conducted a systematic review on pace bowlers between the ages of 13.7 and 22.5 
years on risk factors and successful interventions for cricket-related low back 
pain. Young cricketers between the ages of 13 and 18 years are different to 
adults in terms of their physiology which impacts on their predisposition to 
injury and phases of healing. Young cricketers may differ from an adult 
population in that young pace bowlers who sustain injuries during their bowling 
career may have given up on the sport by the time they approach adulthood, and 
the composition of the adult pace bowler population group is therefore affected 
by natural selection which may cause this group to differ from the original 
population. Caution is thus advised when generalizing findings from this young 
population group to adult pace bowlers which emphasizes the need for studies 
amongst adult pace bowlers. Furthermore, the review by Morton et al. included 
articles that specifically investigated factors associated with low back pain. 
However, due to the interconnectedness between the spine and the lower limbs, 
kinematic variables affecting the spine will also affect the load placed on the 
lower limbs with subsequent risk of injury. The interdependent mechanical 
interactions in a linked segment system such as the system of motion of the low 
back can be caused by movement coordination patterns in other body segments. The 
systematic review by Morton et al. only included intrinsic factors while the 
proposed review will also look at extrinsic factors. Therefore, the primary 
objective of this review is to determine extrinsic and intrinsic factors 
associated with non-contact injury in adult pace bowlers.

BACKGROUND: Low backache is the most common ailment flooding the orthopaedic 
clinic. Most of the population at least once seek medical attention for low back 
ache. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non invasive, commonly used 
diagnosing modality and accurate in diagnosing pathology causing low back ache.
AIM: To classify and quantify the causes of low back pain referred to radiology 
department by MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with back pain referred to radiology department 
were subjected to single MRI scan after ruling out any contraindications using 
the following sequences: T1W Turbo Spin Echo, T2W Turbo Spin Echo, 
Gradient-echo, Myelogram and short TI inversion recovery (STIR), in all imaging 
planes. Gadolinium enhanced T1W turbo spin echo sequence was used wherever 
necessary.
RESULTS: Data were analysed using Excel 2007, SPSS 14, Students t-test. 
Degenerative disc diseases were the commonest pathology followed by congenital 
and traumatic lesions. Neoplastic lesions were the least common. Commonest 
herniation type being the disc bulge (79%) followed by disc protrusion (15%), 
disc extrusion (6%) and disc sequestration (<1%). The posterolateral disc 
herniation as the commonest and foraminal the least. Sacralisation was the most 
common congenital spinal anomaly, followed by lumbar scoliosis and perineural 
cyst. There is no sex difference in disc protrusion but male preponderance in 
disc extrusion with subligmentous extrusion.
CONCLUSION: MRI is useful in classifying the spinal lesions which again 
influences the treatment modality and clinical outcome. Degenerative disc 
disease is the single most common category which accounts for most the Low Back 
Ache for which a preventing strategy should be drafted.

The Pilates method has recently become a fast-growing popular way of exercise 
recommended for healthy individuals and those engaged in rehabilitation. Several 
published studies have examined the effects of Pilates method in people with 
chronic low back pain (LBP). The objective of this study is to describe and 
provide an extensive overview of the scientific literature comparing the 
effectiveness of the Pilates method on pain and disability in patients with 
chronic nonspecific LBP. The study is based on the data from the following 
sources: MEDLINE-NLM, MEDLINE-EBSCO, Scopus Elsevier, Cochrane, DOAJ, SciELO, 
and PLOSONE. Original articles and systematic reviews of adults with chronic 
nonspecific LBP that evaluated pain and/or disability were included in this 
study; studies in which the primary treatment was based on Pilates method 
exercises compared with no treatment, minimal intervention, other types of 
intervention, or other types of exercises. The Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) were adopted. The literature 
search included 7 electronic databases and the reference list of relevant 
systematic reviews and original articles to July 2014. Two independent 
investigators conducted the literature search and performed the synthesis as 
follows: Study Design; Sample (n); Disability measure; Intervention; and Main 
results. The searches identified a total of 128 articles. From these, 29 were 
considered eligible and were included in the analysis. The items were stratified 
as follows: Pilates method versus other kind of exercises (n = 6 trials) and 
Pilates method versus no treatment group or minimal intervention for short-term 
pain (n = 9 trials); the therapeutic effect of the Pilates method in randomized 
cohorts (n = 5); and analysis of reviews (n = 9). We found that there is a 
dearth of studies that clearly demonstrates the efficacy of a specific Pilates 
exercise program over another in the treatment of chronic pain. However, the 
consensus in the field suggests that Pilates method is more effective than 
minimal physical exercise intervention in reducing pain. These conclusions need 
to be supported by other proper investigations.

Primary mediastinal (thymic) B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is resistant to treatment 
when compared with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Moreover, the optimal 
first -line treatment of PMBL has not yet been determined. Herein, we report a 
case of PMBL that was successfully treated with the dose adjusted (DA) 
etoposide, prednisolone, vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with 
rituximab (EPOCH-R) regimen. A-29-year-old woman was referred to our hospital 
with an anterior mediastinal tumor. Eight months before admission, she had 
visited a clinic for pain in the chest and back, but no abnormalities were 
found. Subsequently, her chest pain got worse, and she went to another clinic, 
where she was detected with an anterior mediastinal tumor and was referred to 
our hospital. Tumor biopsy with a thoracoscope was performed, and a diagnosis of 
PMBL was made. The tumor diameter was 90 mm, with invasion to the lungs and 
superior vena cava. The tumor had a clinical stage of IEA, and the International 
Prognostic Index (IPI) was low risk. She was treated with the DA-EPOCH-R regimen 
for 8 courses, and a complete response was achieved. A recent retrospective 
study of DA-EPOCH-R treatment without radiotherapy for PMBL was recently 
published. It showed that the event-free survival rate was 93% and the overall 
survival rate was 97% during a median 5-year follow-up. Thus, DA-EPOCH-R may be 
a potential standard treatment for PMBL.

Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a widely recognized contributor to low 
back pain (LBP). The Prevention or reversal of IDD is a potential treatment for 
LBP. Unfortunately, current treatments for IDD are aimed at relieving symptoms 
rather than regenerating disc structure or function. Recently, the injection of 
growth factors and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation have been shown 
to be promising biological therapies for IDD. Growth factors stimulate the 
proliferation of and matrix synthesis by intervertebral disc (IVD) cells, 
leading to the regeneration of degenerative discs. Growth factors, hypoxia and 
co-culture with nucleus pulposus (NP) cells induce MSCs to differentiate toward 
an NP-like phenotype, which can increase the number of functional cells in the 
IVD or enhance the function of endogenous disc cells to facilitate IVD 
regeneration. Therefore, the emerging roles of growth factors in IVD 
regeneration have piqued the interest of researchers. Growth factors including 
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), 
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and growth and differentiation factor-5 
(GDF-5), among others, have been demonstrated to enhance anabolism in IVD cells 
and to induce NP-like differentiation of MSCs. However, the injection of TGF, 
IGF and FGF into human IVDs may induce unwanted blood vessel ingrowth, which 
accelerates the process of IDD, the injection of GDF-5 may not have the same 
effect. This finding suggests that GDF-5 is a preferable growth factor for use 
in IDD treatment compared with TGF, IGF and FGF. The GDF-5 gene is one of the 
few growth factor genes that have been found to be associated with IDD thus far; 
moreover, the GDF-5 gene defects lead to collagen and proteoglycan abnormalities 
in discs in mice, suggesting that GDF-5 contributes to the structural and 
functional maintenance of the IVD. This review is focused on the functions of 
GDF-5 in the IVD and on the association between GDF-5 and a genetic 
predisposition to IDD. The effects of GDF-5 on IVD regeneration and on MSC 
differentiation are also discussed. GDF-5 plays a crucial role in the 
pathogenesis of IDD and is a promising therapeutic agent for IDD. Additionally, 
stem cell transplantation has been shown to be a promising biological therapy 
for IDD.

History A 75-year-old woman with a medical history of gastroesophageal reflux 
disease and type II diabetes presented to the hospital with a 3-month history of 
gradually worsening headaches, vague upper abdominal pain, and lower back pain. 
The patient denied fevers, night sweats, contact with sick individuals, 
occupational exposure to infection, bleeding, immunodeficiency, intravenous drug 
use, alcohol or tobacco abuse, history of malignancy, family history of genetic 
disorders, and international travel. Physical examination revealed a 
skin-colored mass protruding from the right side of her forehead, but there were 
no other notable abnormalities. Her diabetes was managed with diet, and the only 
prescription medication she was taking was esomeprazole. She was not taking 
anticoagulants. Initial laboratory work-up revealed anemia and profound 
thrombocytopenia (hemoglobin level, 9.4 g/dL; platelet count, 16 × 10(9)/L); 
these were refractory to aggressive treatment, including plasmapheresis, 
immunosuppression with prednisolone, and numerous transfusions. Contrast 
material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the head was performed at 
admission to further evaluate the patient's headache and the mass on the 
patient's forehead. Ultrasonography (US) of the abdomen was performed to 
evaluate the cause of abdominal pain. The discovery of liver lesions at US led 
us to perform contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the abdomen was performed to narrow 
the diagnostic considerations for the lesions identified at CT. Bone marrow 
biopsy revealed no evidence of infectious or neoplastic processes. Endoscopy and 
colonoscopy were performed; however, they revealed no abnormalities. Further 
laboratory work-up included extensive testing for parasites, fungi, bacteria, 
and viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All of the 
results were negative. On the 17th day of admission, the patient became acutely 
unresponsive, her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she died. Unenhanced head 
CT was performed at the time of the patient's acute decompensation.

Dorsal midline hemivertebra at the lumbosacral junction: report of 2 cases.

Ansari SF(1), Rodgers RB, Fulkerson DH.

(1)Department of Neurological Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine;

Congenital scoliosis from laterally located hemivertebrae at the lumbosacral 
junction has been described previously. However, dorsally located midline 
hemivertebrae at this location have not been reported. The authors describe the 
presentation, treatment, and outcomes of 2 patients (1 male and 1 female) with 
this rare malformation. All clinical and radiographic records were reviewed. 
Outcomes were recorded using survey instruments (Oswestry Disability Index and 
the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey). Radiographic assessment of bony fusion 
was performed using CT scanning 1 year after surgery. Both patients presented 
with back and leg pain, urinary hesitancy/incontinence, difficulty sitting and 
lying down, waddling gait, and restriction of movement. Imaging showed a 
wedge-shaped dorsal deformity that stretched the nerve roots and compressed the 
canal. Both patients underwent resection of the hemivertebra with posterolateral 
instrumented fusion from L-2 to the pelvis. The female patient had a low-lying 
conus and underwent sectioning of the filum terminale. Both patients showed 
improvement in the ability to sit and lie flat and in bowel and bladder function 
after surgery. The authors describe their experience with 2 patients with 
similar, rare congenital bony deformities at the lumbosacral junction. To their 
knowledge, similar cases have not been previously reported.

Association between bone scintigraphy features of spinal degeneration and 
anthropometric and demographic variables.

Chatziioannou S, Kallergi M, Karampina P, Zotou P, Bakalis S, Lyra V, 
Lamprakopoulos G, Armeniakos I, Pneumaticos S.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bone scintigraphy is a molecular imaging technique 
routinely used for the evaluation of benign and malignant bone abnormalities. 
This study aimed at evaluating spinal degenerative changes detected by bone 
scintigraphy and determining associations between image features and patients’ 
anthropometric and demographic variables.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: In a cross-sectional study, 64 men and 52 women underwent 
bone scintigraphy. Experts identified all image regions suggesting degenerative 
joint disease (DJD) and classified region intensity on a 3-point scale. Image 
characteristics were correlated to the patients’ body mass index (BMI), age, 
weight, height, activity level, and sex. Data analysis included descriptive 
statistics and association coefficients.
RESULTS: DJD was found in 53 patients (46%). In men, there was weak but 
statistically significant correlation between DJD and activity level, and DJD 
and age, but not BMI or weight. In women, only a weak, not statistically 
significant, linear correlation was found between DJD and BMI, and DJD and 
weight.
CONCLUSION: Molecular imaging with bone scintigraphy showed that spinal 
degenerations are associated with different anthropometric and demographic 
features in men and women. Interestingly, no association was found between DJD 
and increased body weight in men while a weak association may exist in women. 
The results prompt for additional studies to better determine the risk factors 
for DJD and low back pain in male and female patients.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic study, Level II (retrospective study).

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Current evidence suggests that neck pain is negatively 
associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, these studies 
are cross-sectional and do not inform the association between neck pain and 
future HRQoL.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between 
increasing grades of neck pain severity and HRQoL 6 months later. In addition, 
this longitudinal study examines the crude association between the course of 
neck pain and HRQoL.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a population-based cohort study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Eleven hundred randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults were 
included.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were the mental component summary (MCS) and 
physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire.
METHODS: We formed a cohort of 1,100 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in 
September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain Questionnaire to measure neck pain and 
its related disability. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure physical and 
mental HRQoL 6 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure 
the association between graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for 
confounding. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to measure the crude 
association among four possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The 
neck pain trajectories over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck 
pain, worsening neck pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of 
variance was used to examine changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores 
among the four neck pain trajectory groups.
RESULTS: The 6-month follow-up rate was 74.9%. We found an exposure-response 
relationship between neck pain and physical HRQoL after adjusting for age, 
education, arthritis, low back pain, and depressive symptomatology. Compared 
with participants without neck pain at baseline, those with mild (β=-1.53, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]=-2.83, -0.24), intense (β=-3.60, 95% CI=-5.76, -1.44), 
or disabling (β=-8.55, 95% CI=-11.68, -5.42) neck pain had worse physical HRQoL 
6 months later. We did not find an association between neck pain and mental 
HRQoL. A worsening course of neck pain and persistent neck pain were associated 
with worse physical HRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that neck pain was negatively associated with physical but 
not mental HRQoL. Our analysis suggests that neck pain may be a contributor of 
future poor physical HRQoL in the population. Raising awareness of the possible 
future impact of neck pain on physical HRQoL is important for health-care 
providers and policy makers with respect to the management of neck pain in 
populations.

Instrumented reduction and monosegmental fusion for Meyerding Grade IV 
developmental spondylolisthesis: a report of 3 cases.

There are numerous reports of treatment methods for spondylolisthesis with a 
Meyerding Grade of more than III. In high dysplastic spondylosthesis, surgical 
treatment was selected because there is considered to be a high possibility of 
low back pain and lower limb neurological symptoms worsening if slippage 
progresses. Monosegmental lumbar interbody fusion (L5-S1) with a pedicle screw 
system (PPS) was used to treat three cases of Meyerding Grade IV developmental 
spondylolisthesis. Patients gave written informed consent. The spondylolisthesis 
was reduced to Meyerding Grade I and sagittal balance improved in all three 
cases. In two cases with severe spinal instability, there were no postoperative 
neurological complications and the course was favorable. However, in one case 
with little spinal mobility due to vertebral body dysplasia, despite performing 
sufficient decompression of the nerve root at L5 and slow reduction to avoid 
placing excessive tension on the nerve root, a transient neurological disorder 
was observed. A PPS was used to increase the reduction strength and favorable 
reduction was possible. However, in the case with a long clinical course and the 
case with poor spinal mobility, since the mobility and plasticity of the nerve 
root itself may have been reduced, it was considered that reduction should be 
performed carefully using intraoperative neurological monitoring.

    Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 2015 Apr 15;40(8):587.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of tomographically identified axial gouty 
lesions with clinical and laboratory characteristics.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Axial gout might be more common than previously 
thought. The true relationship of these lesions to symptoms or other 
gout-associated features is poorly understood.
METHODS: Forty-two patients with gout underwent thoracic and lumbar spine 
computed tomographic (CT) scans. CT scans were read by an experienced 
radiologist blinded to the features of the patients. Axial gout was defined as 
the presence of bony erosions, facet joints, or disc calcification and tophi in 
the axial skeleton. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected from 
medical records. At study entry, patients were evaluated for axial symptoms 
(back pain or neurological complaints) and subcutaneous tophi. The Fisher exact 
test and the Student t test were performed for statistical analyses of data.
RESULTS: Twelve (29%) of the 42 patients had CT evidence of axial gout. Axial 
tophi were identified in 5 patients (12%), interapophyseal joints erosions or 
calcifications in 7 patients (17%), and discal abnormalities in 9 patients 
(21%). Lumbar spine involvement was a universal finding. Five patients (42%) had 
thoracic spine involvement and 2 patients (18%) had sacroiliac lesions. No 
association was found between symptoms and axial gout (P = 0.62). Duration of 
gout, mechanism of disease (overproduction vs. underexcretion), and metabolic 
comorbidities were not related to axial involvement. A higher prevalence of 
axial gout was found between patients with current peripheral tophi (67% vs. 
30%; P = 0.03); however, no association was found in patients with a past 
history of tophi (P = 0.72).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a high prevalence of axial gout not 
associated with spine symptoms. This finding introduces a differential diagnosis 
in axial lesions in patients with gout. In addition, the unique association with 
a current but not previous history of peripheral tophi suggests that gout 
treatment might be effective in preventing or solving gout axial lesions.

Previous reports documented abnormalities in cognitive functions and 
decision-making (DM) in patients with chronic pain, but these changes are not 
consistent across studies. Reasons for these discordant findings might include 
the presence of confounders, variability in chronic pain conditions, and the use 
of different cognitive tests. The present study was aimed to add evidence in 
this field, by exploring the cognitive profile of a specific type of chronic 
pain, i.e., chronic low back pain (cLBP). Twenty four cLBP patients and 24 
healthy controls underwent a neuropsychological battery and we focused on 
emotional DM abilities by means of Iowa gambling task (IGT). During IGT, 
behavioral responses and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded in 12 
patients and 12 controls. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were averaged oﬄine 
from EEG epochs locked to the feedback presentation (4000 ms duration, from 2000 
ms before to 2000 ms after the feedback onset) separately for wins and losses 
and the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300 peak-to-peak amplitudes were 
calculated. Among cognitive measures, cLBP patients scored lower than controls 
in the modified card sorting test (MCST) and the score in this test was 
significantly influenced by pain duration and intensity. Behavioral IGT results 
documented worse performance and the absence of a learning process during the 
test in cLBP patients compared to controls, with no effect of pain 
characteristics. ERPs findings documented abnormal feedback processing in 
patients during IGT. cLBP patients showed poor performance in the MCST and the 
IGT. Abnormal feedback processing may be secondary to impingement of chronic 
pain in brain areas involved in DM or suggest the presence of a predisposing 
factor related to pain chronification. These abnormalities might contribute to 
the impairment in the work and family settings that often cLBP patients report.

Many musculoskeletal management philosophies advocate the exploration of the 
relationship between the patient's chief complaint (CC) and the physical 
examination findings that reproduce/reduce/change that CC. Geoffrey Maitland 
developed the concept "comparable sign(s) (CS), which are physical examination 
findings related to the CC(s) that are reproduced during an 
examination/treatment. These include observed abnormalities of movement, 
postures or motor control, abnormal responses to movement, static deformities, 
and abnormal joint assessment findings. There are no studies that have explored 
the potential clinical relationships between the patient's CC and a CS, thus 
this exploratory study evaluated the associations, outcomes, and prevalence of 
the findings. This cohort study involved 112 subjects age 54.3 years (SD = 13.4 
years), with neck (25.9%) or low back pain (74.1%) who were treated with 
physiotherapy for an average of 42 days. Data analysis revealed 88.4% identified 
a CC at baseline. There was a moderate statistical association between CC and 
the active physiological finding of a CS (r = 0.36), and small-moderate 
associations between all examination phases (r = 0.25-0.37). There were no 
statistical differences in pain and disability outcomes for those with and 
without a CC or CS; however, baseline pain levels were higher for those without 
CC (p = 0.04). Further, rate of recovery was lower in those without a CS during 
passive physiological examination. The results would suggest that there may be 
content validity to the concept of CS but further research with larger samples 
sizes is required to explore the extent of the validity is warranted.

Metastatic testicular cancer presenting as lower back pain in a pilot.

Bermudez DJ(1), Groh J.

Author information:
(1)U.S. Navy, Jacksonville, FL, USA.

BACKGROUND: Lower back pain is ubiquitous in the helicopter community and 
testicular cancer is the most common solid organ tumor that affects 
approximately 1% of men ages 15 to 35. However, rarely is lower back pain caused 
by testicular cancer and, in an otherwise healthy male, it is generally low on 
the differential diagnosis. Literature review discovered the most recent case 
report where lower back pain was the presenting symptom for testicular cancer 
was in 1987.
CASE REPORT: A 26-yr-old male helicopter pilot presented to clinic complaining 
of lower back pain for greater than 1 yr for which conservative treatment had 
failed. The pain was so severe he was unable to sleep and had to remove himself 
from the flight schedule. The patient was seen by physical therapy and a 
chiropractor and treated with NSAIDs and other pain medications, including 
narcotics. After further investigation, it was discovered that the patient's 
lower back pain was a result of a retroperitoneal metastatic tumor originating 
from his right testicle.
DISCUSSION: It is important to consider that, although most aviators in their 
twenties have been screened for chronic illness, they are still at risk for 
developing cancer. In this case, the patient never complained of testicular mass 
or pain and even denied symptoms during review of systems questioning. Proper 
education regarding the importance of self-examination and reporting of 
abnormalities is key to early detection and intervention. The 5-yr survival for 
metastatic testicular cancer is greater than 95%.

We report an extremely rare case of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the renal 
pelvis associated with an incompletely duplicated renal pelvis and ureter. A 
71-year-old woman presented with left lower back pain and gross hematuria. 
Urinary cytology showed atypical squamous cells. Computed tomography, magnetic 
resonance imaging and retrograde pyelography revealed left incompletely 
duplicated renal pelvis and ureter and a mass in the left upper renal pelvis. A 
clinical diagnosis of left renal pelvic cancer was made and the patient 
underwent total nephroureterectomy. Histological examination of the resected 
specimen revealed SCC with marked keratinization in the upper renal pelvis. The 
tumor had invaded the renal parenchyma and perinephric fat. There was no 
urothelial carcinoma component. The pathological stage was pT4 N0. There was no 
evidence of recurrence 6 months postoperatively. Because the prognosis of SCC of 
the upper urinary tract is poor, urologists and pathologists should be aware 
that SCC may develop in duplicated urinary systems.

We report two atypical cases of focal Whipple's disease with rheumatic 
presenting symptoms. In one of these cases, the patient presented with chronic 
intermittent polyarthritis, systemic inflammation, and leukocytosis. Tests were 
positive for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. 
There was no structural joint damage. Combined glucocorticoid and methotrexate 
therapy was only partially effective. Endocarditis requiring emergency valve 
replacement surgery occurred 4 years later. Evaluation of this event led to the 
diagnosis of Tropheryma whipplei infection responsible for both the endocarditis 
and the joint disease. The other patient presented with subacute inflammatory 
low back pain. His medical history was chiefly remarkable for intermittent 
inflammatory involvement of the wrists and right knee replacement surgery for 
osteoarthritis followed by a febrile effusion of the operated knee. Radiographs 
showed destructive lesions of the wrists. Magnetic resonance imaging findings 
suggested L2-L3 diskitis. A PCR assay on biopsy specimens from the disk lesions 
recovered T. whipplei, thus establishing the cause of the diskitis and previous 
joint manifestations. Combined doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine therapy was 
followed by full resolution of all clinical and laboratory abnormalities in both 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is a powerful tool for 
evaluation, assessment of severity, and follow up of diseases of the spine. It 
is one of the most sensitive diagnostic tests for detecting anatomic 
abnormalities of the spine and the adjacent structures.
AIM: To determine the pattern of spinal abnormalities on MRI in Kano, Nigeria.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: Patients aged between 2 and 95 years who had spinal MRI 
with AIRIS II TOSHIBA (0.5T) Tesla machine from January to December 2013 were 
reviewed. Information concerning age, gender, region and findings were recorded.
RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty one patients made up of187 males and 74 females 
were reviewed. Their ages ranged from 2 to 95 years with the mean of 46.43 ± 
15.7 years. Lumbo-sacral MRI was the most commonly performed (46.4 %) followed 
by cervical (44.1%), thoraco-lumbar spine (4.2%), thoracic spine (3.8%) and 
cervical and lumbar (1.5%). The most common indication of MRI was low back pain 
in 211 (80.8% ) patients followed by trauma in 36 (17.8% ) patients. About 19.6% 
of the MRI examinations were normal while spondylosis and moderate disc prolapse 
was seen in 31.5% and compressive fracture comprised 7.3% of cases.
CONCLUSION: Lumbo-sacral MRI was the commonest MRI in this study and the 
commonest indications for MRI were low back pain and trauma while the commonest 
findings were spondylosis, disc prolapse, compressive fracture and spinal 
metastases.

Axial mitochondrial myopathy in a patient with rapidly progressive adult-onset 
scoliosis.

Hiniker A, Wong LJ, Berven S, Truong CK, Adesina AM, Margeta M.

Axial myopathy can be the underlying cause of rapidly progressive adult-onset 
scoliosis; however, the pathogenesis of this disorder remains poorly understood. 
Here we present a case of a 69-year old woman with a family history of scoliosis 
affecting both her mother and her son, who over 4 years developed rapidly 
progressive scoliosis. The patient had a history of stable scoliosis since 
adolescence that worsened significantly at age 65, leading to low back pain and 
radiculopathy. Paraspinal muscle biopsy showed morphologic evidence of a 
mitochondrial myopathy. Diagnostic deficiencies of electron transport chain 
enzymes were not detected using standard bioassays, but mitochondrial 
immunofluorescence demonstrated many muscle fibers totally or partially 
deficient for complexes I, III, IV-I, and IV-IV. Massively parallel sequencing 
of paraspinal muscle mtDNA detected multiple deletions as well as a 40.9% 
heteroplasmic novel m.12293G > A (MT-TL2) variant, which changes a G:C pairing 
to an A:C mispairing in the anticodon stem of tRNA Leu(CUN). Interestingly, 
these mitochondrial abnormalities were not detected in the blood of either the 
patient or her son, suggesting that the patient's rapidly progressive late onset 
scoliosis was due to the acquired paraspinal mitochondrial myopathy; the cause 
of non-progressive scoliosis in the other two family members currently remains 
unexplained. Notably, this case illustrates that isolated mitochondrial myopathy 
can underlie rapidly-progressive adult-onset scoliosis and should be considered 
in the differential diagnosis of the primary axial myopathy.

PURPOSE: The present report intended to introduce the hemilaminoplasty technique 
and evaluate the efficacy of our surgical procedure for LISCs.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted to analyze the results in 24 
LISCs who had undergone our hemilaminoplasty between 2000 and 2012 in two 
hospitals. All were confirmed by pathological histology and mid- to long-term 
follow-up had been performed in all cases with a mean of 4.9 years. Using the 
Japanese Orthopedic Association scoring system (JOA score) and visual analog 
scale (VAS), symptoms resulting from cyst compression were quantified at various 
stage for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The JOA score and VAS of back/leg pain following surgery were improved 
significantly (P < 0.01). At final follow-up, with normal aging there was a 
little decrease in JOA score and VAS of back/leg pain, but still significantly 
improved (P < 0.01). Similarly, mean improvement rate of JOA was 83.5 % at 
1 year after surgery while 75.6 % at final visit. Successful bone healing was 
obtained at a mean of 3.8 months after surgery. No cyst reformation and 
recurrent back/leg pain were observed around the surgical sites.
CONCLUSIONS: These lesions could be regarded as a result of facet 
arthrosis/instability and repetitive facet minor trauma with herniation of 
synovium through the defective joint capsule. Improvement in lumbago and leg 
pain may be a consequence of complete cyst resection via hemilaminoplasty plus 
partial facetectomy with anatomical reconstruction of the posterior spinal 
elements.

PURPOSE: Spinal instability of the lumbar spine causes various clinical 
symptoms. Among them, spinal instability is thought to contribute to low back 
pain, but the pathophysiological mechanisms are controversial. Although 
experimental animal models of spinal instability have been reported, it is 
unknown whether these models produce pain and whether spinal instability affects 
walking ability. We used the CatWalk system to investigate whether lumbar 
facetectomy causes gait abnormalities and low back pain.
METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three experimental 
groups. In the sham group, only the bilateral L4-L5 facet joints were exposed. 
In the experimental group, rats underwent complete resection of the bilateral 
L4-L5 facet joints without neural tissue injury. The control group comprised 
naïve rats. The CatWalk system was used to analyze gait in postoperative weeks 
3, 4.5, 6, and 7. Radiological and histological analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: At 7 weeks postoperatively, the rats in the experimental group showed 
the gait abnormalities seen in low back pain and neuropathic pain models. 
Radiological examination of the same rats revealed spinal instability with 
histological evidence of intervertebral disc degeneration.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that spinal instability and/or intervertebral 
disc degeneration induce gait abnormalities and low back pain. This experimental 
model may be useful for elucidating the mechanisms underlying clinical symptoms, 
such as low back pain, in patients with spinal instability.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate radiological sacroiliac abnormalities in IBD patients 
without musculoskeletal symptoms and to determine the clinical and familiar 
differences between IBD patients with and without radiologic sacroiliac joint 
(SIJ) abnormalities. Subsequently, the patients with x-ray alterations were 
followed for 3 years in order to assess the onset of chronic inflammatory back 
pain (IBP).
METHODS: 81 patients (55 Crohn-CD- and 26 ulcerative rettocolitis-UC) with 
remittent and low active IBD, from a tertiary referral centre of 
Gastroenterology Unit, were studied using SIJ x-rays. Differences in IBD 
clinical variables (activity and duration of CD and UC, extra-intestinal 
involvement, treatment with surgery and not, ESR and CRP levels), familiarity 
(for psoriasis, IBD, spondyloarthritis, coeliac syndrome), between patients with 
SIJ x-ray findings and without were investigated. Patients with radiological 
sacroiliac joint abnormalities were followed up clinically for 3 years and the 
onset of symptoms of chronic (higher than 3 consecutive months) IBP was 
investigated.
RESULTS: 22/81 patients (27.1%) showed radiological SIJ abnormalities at 
baseline: isolated sclerosis in 17/22 (77.3%) and localised erosions in 12/22 
(54.5%). Radiological SIJ involvement did not correlate with IBD clinical and 
familial variables. All patients were HLA B27 negative. At 3 years, 4/22 
patients (18.1%) presented chronic IBP symptoms with bone oedema at MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, occult radiological SIJ alterations might precede the onset 
of axial symptoms but, in the absence of clinical signs, it is not possible to 
identify some IBD features or familiar predisposition that might be more 
frequent when SIJ abnormalities are involved. Clinical follow-up might be useful 
in these patients for a diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis onset.

BACKGROUND: The ligamentum longitudinale anterius is a broad and strong band of 
fibrous tissue that runs along the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the 
vertebrae.
AIM: The study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of ossified ligamentum 
longitudinale anterius in adult dry human vertebra.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 95 sets of dry human 
vertebral columns irrespective of age and sex at Mayo Institute of Medical 
Sciences- Barabanki,-UP, Melaka Manipal Medical College-Manipal University and 
Department of Anatomy, KMCT Medical College, Manassery- Calicut, India. All the 
sets of vertebral columns were macroscopically inspected for the ossified 
ligamentum longitudinale anterius.
RESULTS: It was observed that out of 95 sets of vertebral columns, 27 (28.42%) 
vertebral columns showed ossification. Out of 27 vertebral columns, 17 (17.89%) 
vertebral columns showed segmental type of ossification, 2 (2.11%) vertebral 
columns showed continuous type of ossification and 8 (8.42%) vertebral columns 
showed mixed type of ossification at different vertebral level.
CONCLUSION: Such type of ossification will affect the biomechanics of the spine 
and may result in stiff neck, low back pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, compression 
of the brachial plexus, aphonia, immobility or mucosal thickening of larynx. 
Hence, knowledge of such abnormalities should be kept in mind to minimise 
serious complications in any surgical intervention or investigative procedures 
in the region.

Building, 11350-83 Avenue, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2P4, Canada, rferrari@shaw.ca.

The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a daily pain diary on recovery 
from acute low back sprain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pain diaries are often recommended to or used by 
patients suffering with acute lumbar (low back) sprain. Diaries have been shown 
to be associated, however, with a slower rate of recovery after whiplash (neck) 
injury. The effect of diary use on recovery from low back injury is unknown. 
Subjects with acute lumbar (low back) sprain were randomly assigned to one of 
the two groups: a diary group and control group. A total of 58 out of 62 
initially recruited subjects were seen in follow-up 3-month post-injury, 29 in 
the diary group, and 29 in the control group. Data were gathered within 1 week 
of injury on sex, age, and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) scores. The 
diary group was asked then to keep a record of their overall pain experience, 
rating their pain on a scale of 1-10 on a daily basis for 4 weeks. At the 
outset, both groups had similar mean age, sex distribution, and mean ODQ scores. 
After 4 weeks of pain diary use, fewer diary group subjects reported recovery at 
3 months compared with the control group (52 vs. 79 %, respectively, p < 0.05). 
The use of a pain diary for 4 weeks in acute lumbar sprain subjects is 
associated with a reduced rate of recovery.

OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation between lumber disc degeneration and 
sacroiliac joint disorder, in order to provides a new understanding concepts and 
therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of chronic intractable low 
back pain.
METHODS: From August 2009 to October 2010,129 cases with lumbar disc herniation 
were studied with epidemiological methods. Among them, 61 patients with L4, disc 
herniation included 37 males and 24 females, ranging in aged from 20 to 75 years 
old, duration of the disease ranged from 1 to 144 months; The other 68 patients 
with L5S1 disc herniation included 32 males and 36 females,ranging in aged 
froml8 to 76 years old,duration of the disease ranged from 0.5 to 240 months. 
The clinical data, symptoms and signs,X-ray characteristics of lumbar spine and 
pelvis of the patients were investigated by epidemiological. The risk of lumbar 
disc herniation was calculated with case-control study; independent variables 
were screened with single factor analysis; the risk factors for lumbar disc 
herniation were determined with logistic regression analysis, and biomechanics 
analyses were taken.
RESULTS: Among 129 patients with lumbar disc herniation, 88 cases associated 
with sacroiliac joint disorders, sacroiliac joint disorder was a risk factor of 
lumbar disc herniation (OR = 4.61, P = 0.00); 47 cases associated with 
sacroiliac joint disorders in 61 patients with L4,5 disc herniation, iliac crest 
uneven caused by iliac rotational displacement was a high risk factor of L4,5 
disc herniation (OR = 11.27, P = 0.00); 41 cases associated with sacroiliac 
joint disorders in 68 patients with L5S1 disc herniation, lumbar sacral angle 
abnormalities caused by sacral tilt shift was a high risk factor L5S1 disc 
herniation (OR = 2.31, P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Lumbar disc herniation and sacroiliac joint disorder are two of 
fallot, the two factors affect each other and there is a causal relationship. 
They are common exists in low back pain.

Impaired tactile acuity in people with chronic pain conditions has been 
suggested to reflect altered cortical representation of the painful body part, 
and treatments that aim to improve tactile acuity in these conditions have shown 
clinical benefit. Whether abnormalities in tactile acuity are a consistent 
feature of chronic pain remains largely unknown. The aim of this review was to 
systematically evaluate the literature and use meta-analysis to establish 
whether tactile acuity is altered in people with chronic non-neuropathic pain. 
We systematically searched the literature for studies that investigated tactile 
acuity in people with chronic non-neuropathic pain and compared it to an 
appropriate control group. Sixteen studies, reporting data from 5 chronic pain 
conditions, were included. Data were available for 18 chronic pain populations 
(n = 484) and 15 control populations (n = 378). Our results suggest that tactile 
acuity is diminished in arthritis, complex regional pain syndrome, and chronic 
low back pain but not in burning mouth syndrome. The strength of the available 
evidence is weakened by somewhat inconsistent results and the high risk of bias 
observed in all of the included studies.
PERSPECTIVE: This systematic review synthesizes the evidence for tactile acuity 
deficits in people with chronic non-neuropathic pain. The findings suggest that 
tactile acuity deficits may be characteristic of chronic pain. That tactile 
acuity training may benefit those with chronic pain disorders suggests that 
clinical trials may be warranted.

Low back pain is a common medical condition that has significant implications 
for healthcare providers and the UK economy. Low back pain can be classified as 
'specific' in which an underlying pathophysiological mechanism is identified 
(eg, herniated intervertebral disc). Advanced imaging should be performed in 
this situation and in those patients in whom systemic disease is strongly 
suspected. In the majority (approximately 90%), low back pain in 'non specific' 
and there is a weak correlation with imaging abnormalities. This is an area of 
ongoing research and remains controversial in terms of imaging approach and 
treatment (eg, theory of discogenic pain, interpretation and treatment of 
endplate changes). With regards Modic endplate changes, current research 
suggests that an infective component may be involved that may identify novel 
potential treatments in patients with chronic low back pain refractory to other 
treatment modalities. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment 
of degenerative changes in intervertebral discs. MRI has superior soft tissue 
contrast resolution when compared to other imaging modalities (eg, plain 
radiography, CT). An understanding of normal anatomy and MR appearances of 
intervertebral discs, particularly with regards to how these appearances change 
with advancing age, is required to aid image interpretation. Knowledge of the 
spectrum of degenerative processes that may occur in the intervertebral discs is 
required in order to identify and explain abnormal MRI appearances. As the 
communication of MRI findings may guide therapeutic decision making and surgical 
intervention, the terminology used by radiologists must be accurate and 
consistent. Therefore, description of degenerative disc changes in the current 
paper is based on the most up-to-date recommendations, the aim being to aid 
reporting by radiologists and interpretation of reports by referring clinicians.

PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence of lumbosacral transitional vertebra 
(LSTV) within the Chinese Han population, and to determine whether LSTV 
correlates with low back pain (LBP) and gluteal pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Typical standing pelvic radiographs were obtained for 
5860 volunteers between 18 to 60 years of age. The lumbosacral region of each 
spine was evaluated to identify LSTV, which was classified into types I, II, 
III, and IV based on Castellvi's method. Histories of low back symptoms were 
obtained using a questionnaire. The association of different subtypes of LSTV 
with LBP and gluteal pain was explored.
RESULTS: LSTV was found in 15.8% (928 of 5860) of our study population. Of the 
928 individuals with LSTV, 44.8% were type I (dysplastic transverse process with 
height >19mm), 43.2% were type II (pseudoarticulation), 7.2% were type III 
(fusion), and 4.8% were type IV (a unilateral type II transition with a type III 
fusion on the contralateral side). Type II LSTV were closely associated with LBP 
and gluteal pain, with respective odds ratios (ORs) of 2.56 (95% CI: 2.17-3.89) 
and 5.38 (95% CI: 4.29-8.43). Similarly, types IV LSTV also demonstrated a 
significant correlation with LBP and gluteal pain, with respective ORs of 4.28 
(95% CI: 3.21-6.35) and 6.82 (95% CI: 5.17-16.59).
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study, the prevalence of LSTV was 15.8%, 
with type I being the most common. Importantly, LSTV types II and IV were 
significantly associated with LBP and gluteal pain.

Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) is a rare primary immunodeficiency 
syndrome characterized by recurrent staphylococcal infections in the skin and 
lungs, with an incidence of less than one case per million persons. Skeletal and 
connective tissue abnormalities, such as scoliosis, osteoporosis, pathological 
fractures, and hyperextensive joints, are other manifestations of HIES. However, 
only one report documents the use of implants to treat spinal deformity caused 
by HIES, which was discovered following corrective surgery resulting in 
postoperative infection. In this case report, the authors describe a 16-year-old 
male with low-back pain and infections of the soft tissue. Radiological findings 
showed deteriorated kyphotic deformity due to the pathological compression 
fracture of T-11 with intensive conservative treatment. Anterior and posterior 
fixation surgery was performed. Thereafter, the patient showed no signs of 
infection. An investigation was conducted to avoid any postoperative infection.

PURPOSE: Treatment of patellar tendinopathy/jumper's knee with ultrasound-guided 
sclerosing injections or ultrasound-guided arthroscopic shaving has shown good 
clinical short-term results. Former studies indicate that the tendon thickness 
and structure stays unaffected after successful treatment. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the sonographic findings and clinical outcome 3-5 years after 
treatment of patellar tendinopathy with ultrasound-guided sclerosing injections 
or arthroscopic shaving.
METHODS: Fifty-seven patellar tendons (43 patients) with chronic patellar 
tendinopathy were evaluated, with ultrasound, colour Doppler (CD) and visual 
analogue scale (VAS) for pain and satisfaction with treatment, 3-5 years after 
treatment. Functional status was evaluated with a single question-"Back in full 
loading activity?" yes or no.
RESULTS: At endpoint (mean 46 months), there was a significant decrease in 
anteroposterior thickness of the proximal patellar tendon in patients treated 
with ultrasound-guided arthroscopic shaving but not after sclerosing injections. 
Tendon structure had improved, and CD local blood flow had diminished 
significantly in both groups. There were good clinical results with a 
significant decrease in VAS for pain after sclerosing injections (VAS 
64 ± 18 → 17 ± 23) with 74 % satisfied patients and also after arthroscopic 
shaving (VAS 77 ± 16 → 13 ± 23) with 80 % satisfied patients. There were no 
significant differences in VAS between groups. A significant correlation between 
low local blood flow and high patient satisfaction was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Tendon thickness decreased over time after ultrasound-guided 
arthroscopic shaving, and tendon structure and local blood flow decreased after 
both treatments. There were good, and similar, clinical results with both 
methods.

[Treatment of thoracolumbar deformity with transpedicular eggshell technique].

[Article in Chinese]

Yue B, Jiang GQ, Sheng WB, Lu B, Ou Yang J, Luo KF, Lu JY, Mai ED.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of transpedicular eggshell technique 
in treating thoracolumbar deformity.
METHODS: From December 2008 to December 2011,36 patients with thoracolumbar 
deformity were treated with transpedicular eggshell technique. There were 20 
males and 16 females with an average age of 45 years old (ranged from 20 to 58). 
Among them, 5 cases were congenital hemivertebrae deformity, 12 cases were 
secondary to tuberculotic deformity, 14 cases were post-traumatic deformity with 
pain, 5 cases were ankylosing spondylitis. Low back pain, living ability, 
scoliotic Cobb angle were analyzed according to VAS scoring, Oswestry Disability 
Index (ODI), radiological examination.
RESULTS: Average operative time was 245 min and average bleeding was 1 900 ml in 
36 patients. All patients were followed up more than 1 year and obtained bone 
fusion at 1 year after operation. Preoperative,postoperative at 1 week and 1 
year, VAS scoring was 7.2 +/- 1.4, 2.5 +/- 1.0, 1.8 +/- 0.5, respectively; ODI 
was (72.50 +/- 10.80)%, (42.50 +/- 11.10)%, (22.50 +/- 7.90)%, respectively; 
kyphosis Cobb angle was (76.31 +/- 2.52) degrees, (23.66 +/- 1.16) degrees, 
(23.67 +/- 1.16) degrees, respectively; lumbar scoliosis Cobb angle was (71.86 
+/- 4.02) degrees, (30.81 +/- 2.33) degrees, (30.82 +/- 2.32) degrees, 
respectively. Postoperative at 1 week and 1 year,above data had obviously 
improved than that of preoperative (P < 0.05); and there was no significant 
difference in Cobb angle between postoperative at 1 week and postoperative at 1 
year (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Treatment of thoracolumbar deformity with transpedicular eggshell 
technique could obtain effective correcting and clinical results.

A 3-month Follow-up Study of the Long-term Effects of Direct Stretching of the 
Tensor Fasciae Latae Muscle in Patients with Acute Lumbago Using a Single-case 
Design.

[Purpose] A 3-month follow-up study was conducted on a patient diagnosed with 
acute nonspecfic lumbago. Direct stretching (DS) of the tensor fasciae latae 
muscle (TFLM) was performed, and an immediate effect was confirmed. [Subjects] 
The case subject was a 60-year-old woman diagnosed with acute nonspecific 
lumbago. [Methods] We used a single-case study design and an AB-type study 
structure, in which the leg was placed in positions that relieved the back pain 
in period A and DS of the TFLM was performed in period B. The evaluation indices 
were the visual analog scale (VAS), finger-to-floor distance (FFD), and 
posterior lumbar flexibility (PLF), which were analyzed using the binomial test. 
[Results] The VAS, FFD, and PLF in period B showed significant improvement when 
compared with period A. Additionally, complaints of lower back pain ceased after 
2 weeks, and the results of the follow-up study showed no recurrence of back 
pain during the 3 months. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that DS 
of the TFLM has an immediate effect on acute nonspecific lumbago in addition to 
long-term pain relief effects.

Association of low back pain, somatic dysfunction, and lumbar bone mineral 
density: reproducibility of findings.

CONTEXT: Somatic dysfunction as diagnosed by palpation should be associated with 
an objective measure. Bone mineral density (BMD) has been shown to be elevated 
in lumbar vertebrae with somatic dysfunction and in the lumbar region of 
individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of lumbar somatic dysfunction and BMD 
T-score variability in participants with chronic LBP and without LBP (non-LBP) 
and to determine the reproducibility of previously published results.
METHODS: Two examiners, blinded to symptom history, evaluated participants for 
tissue texture abnormalities, rotational asymmetry, anterior motion restriction, 
and tenderness at vertebral levels L1 to L4. Participants also underwent 
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of vertebral levels L1 to L4 for the assessment 
of BMD T scores. Generalized linear models were used to compare the chronic LBP 
and non-LBP groups on the presence and severity of somatic dysfunction and to 
test whether group and the presence and severity of somatic dysfunction were 
related to BMD T scores.
RESULTS: Forty-three chronic LBP (54%) and 36 non-LBP participants (46%) 
completed the study. Although the presence of somatic dysfunction in the 2 
groups was not significantly different, the presence of tenderness was 
significantly more common in the chronic LBP group (P<.001), as was the severity 
for tissue texture abnormalities (P=.03), motion restriction (P=.04), and 
tenderness (P<.001). Of the 316 vertebrae assessed, 31 (10%, all in the chronic 
LBP group) had moderate/severe tenderness. The vertebral somatic dysfunction 
burden score, the total somatic dysfunction burden score, the vertebral somatic 
dysfunction severity score, and the total somatic dysfunction severity score 
were higher in the chronic LBP group (all P<.001). The vertebral BMD T score was 
significantly higher for vertebrae demonstrating moderate/severe rotational 
asymmetry compared with those demonstrating mild or no rotational asymmetry 
(P=.01) and for vertebrae demonstrating moderate/severe tenderness compared with 
those demonstrating no tenderness (P=.04).
CONCLUSION: Study results suggest that somatic dysfunction was more significant 
in chronic LBP participants. Although the correlation between the presence of 
somatic dysfunction and segmental BMD T scores was not reproduced, BMD T scores 
were higher for vertebrae demonstrating moderate/severe rotational asymmetry and 
tenderness.

Ireland. Electronic address: paula.tansey@hse.ie.

A change in hip morphology, such as femoral anteversion may be a factor in 
patients with lower quadrant pain. This case study highlights the importance of 
angle of torsion assessment and consideration of a patient's individual angle in 
designing rehabilitation programs. A patient who had a four year history of hip 
pain and a one year history of low back pain, in the presence of femoral 
anteversion is presented. She was successfully treated by altering her lower 
limb position as well as performing exercises in this alignment.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with axial SpA experience repeated spine imaging. EOS is a 
new low-dose imaging system with significantly lower irradiation than 
conventional radiography (CR). The objective was to explore the EOS performances 
compared with CR for the classification and follow-up of SpA.
METHODS: We performed an observational, cross-sectional, single-centre study 
including SpA patients (definite diagnosis by expert opinion) and control 
patients [definite chronic mechanical low back pain (cLBP)]. All patients 
underwent pelvic and frontal and lateral CR of the entire spine and 
two-dimensional (2D) EOS imaging on the same day. Images were blindly assessed 
for sacroiliitis [modified New York criteria (mNY)] and for ankylosis of the 
spine [modified Stoke AS Spine Score (mSASSS)]. Global ease of interpretation 
was rated on a scale of 0-10. The primary outcome was intermodality agreement, 
with an a priori defined non-inferiority limit of 0.7. Interobserver, 
intra-observer and intermodality agreement were measured by kappa, weighted 
kappa, intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots.
RESULTS: Forty-eight SpA patients [mean age 47.6 years (s.d. 14.9), symptom 
duration 21.4 years (s.d. 13.3), 35 (70%) men] and 48 cLBP controls [mean age 
49.1 years (s.d. 10.7), 9 (22.5%) men] were included. Intermodality agreement 
between EOS and CR was 0.50 (95% CI 0.26, 0.75) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95, 0.98) for 
sacroiliitis and mSASSS, respectively. Ease of interpretation was greater for CR 
[8.2 (s.d. 0.9)] compared with EOS [7.2 (s.d. 0.8), P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that EOS could replace CR for the follow-up of 
structural damage of the spine, but its place in the classification of 
sacroiliitis needs to be further explored.

BACKGROUND: Beach volleyball is an intensive sport with high impact on the 
lumbar spine. Low back pain (LBP) is frequent among elite players. Increased 
prevalence of pathological changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 
lumbar spine of elite athletes has been reported.
HYPOTHESIS: There is an increased prevalence of disc degeneration and 
spondylolysis in the MRI of the lumbar spine of professional beach volleyball 
players.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Twenty-nine fully competitive professional male volleyball players 
(mean age, 28 years) completed outcomes questionnaires and underwent a complete 
clinical examination and an MRI of their lumbar spine.
RESULTS: Whereas 86% of players suffered from LBP during their career, the 
incidence of LBP in the last 4 weeks was 35%. Pain rated using a visual analog 
scale (VAS) averaged 3 points (range, 0-8). Twenty-three of 29 players (79%) had 
at least 1 degenerated disc of Pfirrmann grade ≥3. The most affected spinal 
levels were L4-5 in 14 (48%) and L5-S1 in 15 players (52%); both levels were 
involved in 5 players (17%). Six of 29 (21%) players showed a spondylolysis 
grade 4 according to the Hollenburg classification; there was evidence of 
spondylolisthesis in 2 players. There was no significant correlation between LBP 
and MRI abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: In the lumbar spine MRI of professional beach volleyball players, 
the prevalence of disc degeneration is 79%. Spondylolysis (21%) is up to 3 times 
higher compared with the normal population. Abnormal MRI findings did not 
correlate with LBP, thus MRIs have to be interpreted with caution.

STUDY DESIGN: Two-year, prospective cohort data from the Japan epidemiological 
research of occupation-related back pain study in urban settings were used for 
this analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between aggravated low back pain and 
psychosocial factors among Japanese workers with mild low back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although psychosocial factors are strongly indicated 
as yellow flags of low back pain (LBP) leading to disability, the association 
between aggravated LBP and psychosocial factors has not been well assessed in 
Japanese workers.
METHODS: At baseline, 5,310 participants responded to a self-administered 
questionnaire including questions about individual characteristics, ergonomic 
work demands, and work-related psychosocial factors (response rate: 86.5%), with 
3,811 respondents completing the 1-year follow-up questionnaire. The target 
outcome was aggravation of mild LBP into persistent LBP during the follow-up 
period. Incidence was calculated for the participants with mild LBP during the 
past year at baseline. Logistic regression was used to explore risk factors 
associated with persistent LBP.
RESULTS: Of 1,675 participants who had mild LBP during the preceding year, 43 
(2.6%) developed persistent LBP during the follow-up year. Multivariate analyses 
adjusted for individual factors and an ergonomic factor found statistically 
significant or almost significant associations of the following psychosocial 
factors with persistent LBP: interpersonal stress at work [adjusted odds ratio 
(OR): 1.96 and 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.00-3.82], job satisfaction 
(OR: 2.34, 95%CI: 1.21-4.54), depression (OR: 1.92, 95%CI: 1.00-3.69), somatic 
symptoms (OR: 2.78, 95%CI: 1.44-5.40), support from supervisors (OR: 2.01, 
95%CI: 1.05-3.85), previous sick-leave due to LBP (OR: 1.94, 95%CI: 0.98-3.86) 
and family history of LBP with disability (OR: 1.98, 95%CI: 1.04-3.78).
CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors are important risk factors for persistent LBP 
in urban Japanese workers. It may be necessary to take psychosocial factors into 
account, along with physical work demands, to reduce LBP related disability.

Dipygus or pygomelia is an incomplete form of twinning due to the incomplete 
division of the embryonic disc. This extremely rare condition consists in the 
presence of an accessory limb that generally inserts into the buttock or 
perineum. Associated anomalies such as duplication of the genitourinary or the 
intestinal tract are frequent, and recurrently appear associated with spinal 
anomalies such as congenital scoliosis due to hemivertebra. We present our 
experience with a 20-year-old girl, the first and only case of dipygus recorded 
and treated in Switzerland, who came to us complaining of increasing low back 
pain along with a progressive congenital scoliosis due to the presence of a 
hemivertebra between L5 and S1, which was removed in a single stage exclusively 
through a posterior approach.

This case represents the development of dizziness, palpitation, tightness in 
chest, flushing, and tremor on consumption of a single dose of tapentadol (100 
mg) for acute lower back pain. The patient was admitted in the intensive cardiac 
care unit for continuous monitoring. At admission, electrocardiogram showed 
tachycardia (140/min) along with ST segment elevation in second chest lead (V2). 
The patient was monitored and advised not to take further doses of tapentadol. 
He was discharged after 36 hours of admission. Tapentadol should be used 
cautiously in patients with cardiovascular diseases and receiving 
sympathomimetic drugs.

Lower back pain (LBP) is widely prevalent all over the world and more than 80% 
of the people suffer from LBP at some point of their lives. Moreover, a shortage 
of radiologists is the most pressing cause for the need of CAD (computer-aided 
diagnosis) systems. Automatic localization and labeling of intervertebral discs 
from lumbar MRI is the first step towards computer-aided diagnosis of lower back 
ailments. Subsequently, for diagnosis and characterization (quantification and 
localization) of abnormalities like disc herniation and stenosis, a completely 
automatic segmentation of intervertebral discs and the dural sac is extremely 
important. Contribution of this paper towards clinical CAD systems is two-fold. 
First, we propose a method to automatically detect all visible intervertebral 
discs in clinical sagittal MRI using heuristics and machine learning techniques. 
We provide a novel end-to-end framework that outputs a tight bounding box for 
each disc, instead of simply marking the centroid of discs, as has been the 
trend in the recent past. Second, we propose a method to simultaneously segment 
all the tissues (vertebrae, intervertebral disc, dural sac and background) in a 
lumbar sagittal MRI, using an auto-context approach instead of any explicit 
shape features or models. Past work tackles the lumbar segmentation problem on a 
tissue/organ basis, and which tend to perform poorly in clinical scans due to 
high variability in appearance. We, on the other hand, train a series of robust 
classifiers (random forests) using image features and sparsely sampled context 
features, which implicitly represent the shape and configuration of the image. 
Both these methods have been tested on a huge clinical dataset comprising of 212 
cases and show very promising results for both disc detection (98% disc 
localization accuracy and 2.08mm mean deviation) and sagittal MRI segmentation 
(dice similarity indices of 0.87 and 0.84 for the dural sac and the 
inter-vertebral disc, respectively).

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pleurotus eryngii (DC. ex Fr.) Quel has been 
collected from the wild, cultivated and used in traditional medicines to treat 
various disorders and diseases since antiquity. In traditional Chinese medicine, 
the powdered fruiting bodies of Pleurotus eryngii were used for 
immunostimulation, skin-care, wound-healing, cancer and lumbago treatment. In 
the current study, we investigated the antiproliferative activity of Pleurotus 
eryngii powder on A549, BGC-823, HepG2 and HGC-27 cancer cells and its 
immunomodulating activity on macrophage, RAW 264.7 cells based on its active 
compound.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel bioactive protein (PEP) was extracted from 
Pleurotus eryngii fruiting bodies powder and purified on DEAE-52, CM-52 and 
Superdex 75 column chromatographies using an ÄKTA purifier. Its cytotoxicity on 
A549, BGC-823, HepG2, HGC-27 and RAW 267.4 cell lines was then evaluated using 
MTT, alamar blue (AB), trypan blue (TB), neutral red (NR), lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH), Annexin V FITC/PI and morphological change assays. Moreover, lysosomal 
enzyme activity, pinocytosis, nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) 
production assays were used to examine immunomostimulatory activity of PEP on 
RAW 267.4 cells.
RESULTS: Based on high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), 
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
analyses, the isolated protein (PEP) had a molecular weight of 63 kDa, a 
secondary (α-helical) structure and was mainly composed of arginine, serine and 
glycine. PEP significantly (P<0.05) inhibited A549, BGC-823, HepG2 and HGC-27 
tumor cells proliferation dose-dependently with an IC₅₀ range of 36.5 ± 0.84 to 
229.0 ± 1.24 µg/ml. Contrarily, PEP stimulated the proliferation of macrophages.
CONCLUSION: Pleurotus eryngii fruiting bodies powder has a potential application 
as a natural antitumor agent with immunomodulatory activity, proposedly, by 
targeting the lysosomes of cancerous cells and stimulating macrophage-mediated 
immune responses.

[Influencing of chronic low back pain on multifidus muscle atrophy].

[Article in Chinese]

Wu WW, Hu ZJ, Fan SW, Xu WB, Fang XQ, Zhao FD.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the affect of chronic low back pain on multifidus muscle 
atrophy and fatty infiltration.
METHODS: From March 2010 to August 2013, a retrospective study were carried out 
in the department of orthopedics of patients with low back pain. Finally 31 
cases were selected to this study including 19 males and 12 females with an 
average age of 36.4 years ranging from 23 to 55 years. The main symptoms of 
these patients were repeated back pain. Duration was more than 1 year. X-ray, 
CT, MRI showed no obvious abnormalities. The changes of net cross-sectional area 
of multifidus and T2 signal ratio of the same patient were measured at different 
time by MRI. VAS and Oswestry disability scores were recorded in two MRI 
examination. Correlation between these change of multifidus net area and T2 
signal ratio in two times measurement and duration of low back pain, VAS, 
Oswestry disability scores were analyzed to find the affection of low back pain 
on paraspinal multifidus muscle.
RESULTS: The net multifidus cross-sectional area in same case by the second 
follow-up MRI is significantly smaller than that of the first follow-up, T2 
signal ratio at second was significantly higher than that of the first (P < 
0.05). The net cross sectional area of multifidus muscles reduced rate were 
positively correlated with VAS scores, duration and of Oswestry disabilitry 
scores (P < 0.001). The rate of increase in T2 signal ratio was not correlated 
with VAS scores,duration and the Oswestry disability scores (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Chronic low back pain is one of the most important reasons of 
paraspinal multifidus muscle atrophy and fatty. The duration, VAS and Oswestry 
disability scores of chronic low back pain were positively correlated with the 
multifidus muscle atrophy.

OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to evaluate patients with low-back 
pain (LBP) and leg pain due to magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed disc 
herniation who are treated with high-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation 
in terms of their short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes of self-reported 
global impression of change and pain levels at various time points up to 1 year 
and to determine if outcomes differ between acute and chronic patients using a 
prospective, cohort design.
METHODS: This prospective cohort outcomes study includes 148 patients (between 
ages of 18 and 65 years) with LBP, leg pain, and physical examination 
abnormalities with concordant lumbar disc herniations. Baseline numerical rating 
scale (NRS) data for LBP, leg pain, and the Oswestry questionnaire were 
obtained. The specific lumbar spinal manipulation was dependent upon whether the 
disc herniation was intraforaminal or paramedian as seen on the magnetic 
resonance images and was performed by a doctor of chiropractic. Outcomes 
included the patient's global impression of change scale for overall 
improvement, the NRS for LBP, leg pain, and the Oswestry questionnaire at 2 
weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 year after the first treatment. The proportion 
of patients reporting "improvement" on the patient's global impression of change 
scale was calculated for all patients and acute vs chronic patients. 
Pretreatment and posttreatment NRS scores were compared using the paired t test. 
Baseline and follow-up Oswestry scores were compared using the Wilcoxon test. 
Numerical rating scale and Oswestry scores for acute vs chronic patients were 
compared using the unpaired t test for NRS scores and the Mann-Whitney U test 
for Oswestry scores. Logistic regression analysis compared baseline variables 
with "improvement."
RESULTS: Significant improvement for all outcomes at all time points was 
reported (P < .0001). At 3 months, 90.5% of patients were "improved" with 88.0% 
"improved" at 1 year. Although acute patients improved faster by 3 months, 81.8% 
of chronic patients reported "improvement" with 89.2% "improved" at 1 year. 
There were no adverse events reported.
CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of acute and importantly chronic lumbar disc 
herniation patients treated with chiropractic spinal manipulation reported 
clinically relevant improvement.

BACKGROUND: Teratomas are tumors comprised of tissues from all three germ 
layers. Teratomas within the spine are exceedingly rare especially in the 
absence of either spinal dysraphism, congenital abnormalities of the spine, 
spinal surgery, or history of lumbar punctures. Virchow was the first to 
describe this occurrence in the spine in 1863 and since then, only a handful of 
cases have been reported.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old male presented with a longstanding history of 
difficulty initiating micturition and lower back pain with recent onset of 
saddle paraesthesia and bilateral leg pain. He did not have a history suggestive 
of spinal trauma nor congenital abnormalities. Neurological examination was 
unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of an 
intradural extra axial lesion in the region of the cauda equine. At surgery, the 
lesion was found to be densely adherent to the conus and a subtotal resection 
was performed. Histological examination confirmed the lesion to be a mature 
teratoma. Postoperatively, he made a good recovery and there is no evidence of 
recurrence at one year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that a teratoma without immature elements can 
be subtotally excised to reduce the risk of neurological morbidity.

Hybrid SPECT/CT imaging is becoming the standard of care in pediatric imaging. 
Indications are mainly for oncologic imaging including mIBG scintigraphy for 
neuroblastoma and I-123 post surgical imaging of children with thyroid 
carcinoma, bone scintigraphy for back pain, children referred from sports 
medicine and neurodevelopmentally delayed children presenting with pain 
symptoms. The studies provide improved diagnostic accuracy, and oncologic 
imaging that includes optimized CT as part of the SPECT/CT study may decrease 
the number of studies and sedation procedures an individual child may need. The 
studies, however, must be tailored on an individual basis as the addition of the 
CT study can increase exposure to the child and should only be performed after 
appropriate justification and with adherence to optimized low dose pediatric 
protocols.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine and compare the areas of brain 
blood flow in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) without structural 
abnormality and acute low back pain (ALBP) with lumber disc herniation (LDH). 
Functional neuroimaging studies provide evidence of abnormalities in the 
regional cerebral blood flow during low back pain. Recent studies have shown 
that CLBP is associated with plastic, pathophysiological changes in the brain. 
However, there has been no report yet statistically or by neuro-images on the 
compared brain single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings 
between CLBP and ALBP patients.
METHODS: The subjects comprised 14 patients, 7 CLBP and 7 ALBP patients. The 
CLBP group included the patients who had no or minor structural abnormality in 
the lumbar spine on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and met the criteria for a 
classification of "pain disorder" (chronic) according to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision. The ALBP 
group included the patients who had symptoms within 3 months of onset and LDH 
revealed by MRI. All patients were assessed using brain SPECT. We then performed 
a two-tailed view analysis using the easy Z score imaging system, determined the 
mean Z scores, and performed vBSEE software (Fujifilm RI Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) 
for both CLBP and ALBP patients.
RESULTS: The CLBP group showed significantly reduced blood flow in the bilateral 
prefrontal cortex of the frontal lobe and increased blood flow in the bilateral 
posterior lobe of the cerebellum.
CONCLUSIONS: SPECT images and statistical analyses revealed the brain blood flow 
alterations in the patients with ALBP and CLBP. These results may suggest that 
the dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex could lead to the appearance of 
unconscious pain behavior controlled by the cerebellum in the patients with 
CLBP.

Renal infarction (RI) is rare, and usually occurs in patients with associated 
comorbidities. The majority of reported cases have presented with laboratory 
abnormalities, most notably leukocytosis and elevated lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH). A 50-year-old active duty white male nonsmoker without medical history 
presented with flank pain. Urinalysis, complete blood count, LDH, and serum 
creatinine were normal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and 
pelvis showed a right-sided RI. The patient was admitted to the hospital and 
anticoagulated. Laboratory values remained normal, and a comprehensive workup 
failed to reveal an etiology for his RI. RI is rare, and affected patients often 
present with symptoms similar to more common conditions such as lumbago or 
nephrolithiasis. Elevated LDH may be a clue to the diagnosis, but unlike 92% of 
the reviewed cases, our patient presented with a normal value. This case 
suggests that clinicians should consider RI in patients with persistent symptoms 
for whom more common causes of flank pain have been excluded; including in 
nonsmoking patients without apparent risk factors for infarction who present 
with a normal LDH and no leukocytosis.

Chronic spinal pain (CSP) is a severely disabling disorder, including 
nontraumatic chronic low back and neck pain, failed back surgery, and chronic 
whiplash-associated disorders. Much of the current therapy is focused on input 
mechanisms (treating peripheral elements such as muscles and joints) and output 
mechanisms (addressing motor control), while there is less attention to 
processing (central) mechanisms. In addition to the compelling evidence for 
impaired motor control of spinal muscles in patients with CSP, there is 
increasing evidence that central mechanisms (ie, hyperexcitability of the 
central nervous system and brain abnormalities) play a role in CSP. Hence, 
treatments for CSP should address not only peripheral dysfunctions but also the 
brain. Therefore, a modern neuroscience approach, comprising therapeutic pain 
neuroscience education followed by cognition-targeted motor control training, is 
proposed. This perspective article explains why and how such an approach to CSP 
can be applied in physical therapist practice.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental diagnostic value of spine MRI evaluated 
separately from and combined with sacroiliac joint (SIJ) MRI in non-radiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) compared with SIJ MRI alone.
METHODS: The study sample comprised two independent cohorts A/B of 130 
consecutive patients aged ≤50 years with back pain, newly referred to two 
university clinics, and 20 healthy controls. Patients were classified according 
to clinical examination and pelvic radiographs as having nr-axSpA (n=50), 
ankylosing spondylitis (n=33), or non-specific back pain (n=47). Four readers 
assessed SIJ and spine MRI separately 6 months apart, and 1-12 months later both 
scans simultaneously using standardised modules. Readers recorded 
presence/absence of SpA and their level of confidence in this conclusion on a 
0-10 scale (0=definitely not; 10=definite). We analysed differences between SIJ 
MRI versus spine MRI alone, and SIJ MRI alone versus combined MRI, descriptively 
by the number/percentage of subjects according to the mean of four readers.
RESULTS: In cohorts A/B, 15.8%/24.2% of patients with nr-axSpA having a negative 
SIJ MRI were reclassified as being positive for SpA by global evaluation of 
combined scans. However, 26.8%/11.4% of non-specific back pain controls and 
17.5% of healthy volunteers with a negative SIJ MRI were falsely reclassified as 
having SpA by combined MRI. Low confidence in a diagnosis of SpA by SIJ MRI 
increased to high confidence by combined MRI in 6.6%/7.3% of patients with 
nr-axSpA.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined spine and SIJ MRI added little incremental value compared 
with SIJ MRI alone for diagnosing patients with nr-axSpA and enhancing 
confidence in this diagnosis.

Medicine, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.

Developmental malformations of lumbar transverse processes commonly include 
hypertrophy of the transverse process, overgrowth of the transverse process, and 
persistence of the transverse process epiphysis. To date, the intertransverse 
pseudarthrosis malformation has not been reported. In this case report, we 
identified a case of intertransverse pseudarthrosis through X-ray imaging, which 
was confirmed by CT scanning. And intertransverse pseudarthrosis of spine was 
proved by Surgery.

Author information:
(1)Graduate School of Physical Therapy, Sahmyook University, Republic of Korea.

[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of abdominal 
bracing with low extremity movement on changes in thickness of abdominal muscles 
and lumbar strength. [Subjects] Sixteen patients with chronic low back pain were 
randomly assigned to two groups: an abdominal bracing with active straight leg 
raise (ABSLR) group and abdominal bracing with ankle dorsiflexion (ABDF) group. 
[Methods] All subjects were evaluated for their abdominal muscle strength using 
a MedX Lumbar Extension Machine and thickness of external oblique (EO), internal 
oblique (IO), and transverse abdominis (TrA) muscles using rehabilitative 
ultrasound imaging. Subjects in both groups were instructed to perform Abdominal 
bracing (AB). Simultaneously, those in the ABSLR group performed active SLR, and 
those in the ABDF group performed ankle dorsiflexion. [Results] In comparison 
between the ABSLR and ABDF groups, significant differences in the thickness of 
the IO and TrA muscles were observed after the intervention in the ABSLR group. 
Also, lumbar strength was showed a significant increase in both groups after 
interventions. [Conclusion] The results of this study demonstrated that ABSLR is 
a more effective method than ABDF for improvement of abdominal stabilization by 
increasing the thicknesses of the TrA and IO.

University-Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, 800 W Jefferson St,

CONTEXT: Clinically meaningful somatic dysfunction, if left untreated, should 
persist over time and be associated with objective measurable findings.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the persistence of lumbar somatic dysfunction over 8 
weeks and the association of that persistence with lumbar bone mineral density 
(BMD) T scores.
METHODS: Individuals were assessed at 0, 4, and 8 weeks for the presence and 
severity of paraspinal tissue texture abnormalities (TTA), vertebral rotational 
asymmetry, anterior motion restriction, and tenderness from L1 to L4. 
Participants underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine at 0 
and 8 weeks. Persistent somatic dysfunction findings from all 3 examinations 
were compared with BMD T scores obtained at 8 weeks and to changes in the BMD T 
scores from 0 to 8 weeks.
RESULTS: Forty-eight individuals (38 women [79%] and 10 men [21%]) participated 
in the study. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 30.1 (6.4) years 
(range, 20.0-40.8 years), and the mean (SD) body mass index was 26.3 (5.2). The 
percentage of vertebrae with persistent somatic dysfunction varied by vertebral 
level and ranged from 44% to 83% for TTA, 63% to 79% for rotational asymmetry, 
10% to 56% for motion restriction, and 2% to 10% for tenderness. Vertebral 
segments with persistent motion restriction had higher mean BMD T scores (95% 
confidence interval [CI]) than those without persistent motion restriction (0.6 
[0.4 to 0.8] vs 0.2 [0.1 to 0.4], respectively; P=.02). There was a significant 
increase in the vertebral BMD T scores for those vertebrae that demonstrated 
persistent TTA (P=.02) and for those vertebrae that demonstrated persistent 
moderate/severe TTA (P=.02). A significant difference was found in the initial 
to final vertebral BMD T-score change between vertebrae that demonstrated 
persistent tenderness and those that did not (mean [95% CI] change, -0.2 [-0.4 
to 0.1] vs 0.1 [0.0 to 0.1], respectively; P=.04).
CONCLUSION: A persistence of predominantly left lumbar rotation was observed. 
Persistent vertebral motion restriction was shown to have an association with 
final lumbar BMD T scores, and persistent TTA and tenderness were associated 
with changes in the BMD T scores over 8 weeks.

Paraspinal muscle morphology and composition: a 15-yr longitudinal magnetic 
resonance imaging study.

Author information:
(1)1University of Alberta, Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, Edmonton, AB, 
CANADA; and 2University of Washington, Seattle, WA.

PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to define the natural progression of 
age-related changes of the lumbar paraspinal muscles during adulthood and to 
investigate the influence of lifestyle and individual factors (e.g., physical 
activity levels at work and leisure, body mass index, and low back pain [LBP]).
METHODS: This population-based longitudinal study included a sample of 99 adult 
male twins. Data were collected through a structured interview, physical 
examination, and magnetic resonance imaging. Measurements of the lumbar 
multifidus and erector spinae muscles were obtained from T2-weighted axial 
images at L3-L4 and L5-S1 at baseline and 15-yr follow-up. Muscle 
cross-sectional area (CSA), functional CSA (FCSA) (fat-free mass), and FCSA/CSA 
(composition) as well as CSA and FCSA asymmetry and FCSA/CSA side-to-side 
differences were measured.
RESULTS: Subjects' mean ± SD age was 47.3 ± 7.4 yr at baseline and 62.3 ± 8.0 yr 
at follow-up. During the 15-yr period, both muscles exhibited a decrease in CSA 
and FCSA and an increase in fatty infiltration and side-to-side differences in 
size and composition at both spinal levels. Both muscles displayed greater 
changes at L5-S1 than L3-L4. Age and BMI were found to be significantly 
associated with the degree of paraspinal muscle changes over time. However, 
there was no association between the change in paraspinal muscle size, 
composition, or asymmetry with the level of physical demands at work or leisure 
or LBP history.
CONCLUSIONS: The present longitudinal study suggests that over adulthood, the 
multifidus and erector spinae undergo similar morphological changes. Moreover, 
our findings suggest that the long-term progression of lumbar paraspinal muscle 
changes evaluated through magnetic resonance imaging are not associated with the 
range of physical demand levels as were typical of Finnish men or LBP history.

patients with Bertolotti's syndrome: presented at the 2013 Joint Spine Section 
Meeting: clinical article.

OBJECT: Bertolotti's syndrome consists of low-back pain caused by lumbosacral 
transitional vertebrae (LSTVs) and LSTV-associated biomechanical spinal changes. 
There is a lack of consensus regarding the cause, clinical significance, and 
treatment of this condition. The authors aim to characterize the clinical 
presentation of patients with Bertolotti's syndrome and describe a minimally 
invasive surgical treatment for this condition.
METHODS: Seven patients who underwent minimally invasive paramedian 
tubular-based resection of the LSTV for Bertolotti's syndrome were identified 
over the course of 5 years. Diagnosis was based on patient history of chronic 
low-back pain, radiographic findings of LSTV, and pain relief on trigger-site 
injection with steroid and/or anesthetics. Electronic medical records were 
reviewed to identify demographics, operative data, and outcomes.
RESULTS: All patients presented with severe, chronic low-back pain lasting an 
average of 8 years that was resistant to nonoperative care. At presentation, 6 
(86%) of 7 patients experienced radicular pain that was ipsilateral to the LSTV. 
Radiographic evidence showed a presence of LSTV in all patients on the left 
(43%), right (29%), or bilaterally (29%). Degenerative disc changes at the L4-5 
level immediately above the anomalous LSTV were observed in 6 of 7 (86%) 
patients; these changes were not seen at the level below the LSTV. Following 
pseudo-joint injection, all patients experienced temporary relief of their 
symptoms. All patients underwent a minimally invasive, paramedian tubular-based 
approach for resection of the LSTV. Three (43%) of 7 patients reported complete 
resolution of low-back pain, 2 (29%) of 7 patients had reduced low-back pain, 
and 2 patients (29%) experienced initial relief but return of low-back pain at 1 
and 4 years postoperatively. Three (50%) of the 6 patients with radicular pain 
had complete relief of this symptom. The median follow-up time was 12 months. No 
intraoperative complication was reported. Two (29%) of 7 patients developed 
postoperative complications including one with a wound hematoma and another with 
new L-5 radiculopathy that resolved 2 years after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of Bertolotti's syndrome should be considered with 
adequate patient history, imaging studies, and diagnostic injections. A 
minimally invasive surgical approach for resection of the LSTV is presented here 
for symptomatic treatment of select patients with Bertolotti's syndrome whose 
conditions are refractory to conventional therapy and who have pain that can be 
attributed to the LSTV. Several short-term complications were noted with this 
procedure, but overall this procedure is effective for treating symptoms related 
to Bertolotti's syndrome.

The adverse effects profile of levetiracetam in epilepsy is still being fully 
described. We recently published a Cochrane Review evaluating the effectiveness 
of levetiracetam, added on to usual care, in treating drug-resistant focal 
epilepsy. The five most common adverse effects were reported and analysed with 
no scope for reporting any less common adverse effects than those. Here, we 
report and analyse the remaining adverse effects (including the five most 
common). These were (in decreasing order of frequency) somnolence; headache; 
asthenia; accidental injury; dizziness; infection; pharyngitis; pain; rhinitis; 
abdominal pain; flu syndrome; vomiting; diarrhoea; convulsion; nausea; increased 
cough; anorexia; upper respiratory tract infection; hostility; personality 
disorder; urinary tract infection; nervousness; depression; aggression; back 
pain; agitation; emotional liability; psychomotor hyperactivity; pyrexia; rash; 
ECG abnormalities; decreased appetite; nasal congestion; irritability; abnormal 
behaviour; epistaxis; insomnia; altered mood; anxiety; bloody urine; diplopia; 
dissociation; memory impairment; pruritis; increased appetite; acne; and stomach 
discomfort. Only somnolence and infection were significantly associated with 
levetiracetam. When adverse effects pertaining to infection were combined, these 
affected 19.7% and 15.1% of participants on levetiracetam and placebo (relative 
risk 1.16, CI 0.89-1.50, Chi(2) heterogeneity p = 0.13). Somnolence and 
infection further retained significance in adults while no single adverse effect 
was significant in children. This review updates the adverse effects profile 
data on levetiracetam use by empirically reporting its common and uncommon 
adverse effects and analysing their relative importance statistically using data 
from a group of trials that possess low Risk of Bias and high Quality of 
Evidence GRADE scores.

Aortocaval fistula is a rare complication of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
We report anesthetic management of a patient with aortocaval fistula caused by 
rupture of a huge abdominal aortic aneurysm into the inferior vena cava. A 
51-year-old man who had complained of low back pain and general fatigue was 
referred to our hospital because of his liver damage. Aortocaval fistula due to 
rupture of a huge abdominal aortic aneurysm was diagnosed from physical 
examination, enhanced computed tomography and color Doppler ultrasonography. 
Anesthesia was induced with propofol and rocuronium, and was maintained with 
sevoflurane and remifentanil. After induction of anesthesia, the central venous 
pressure and cardiac index showed remarkably high values because of 
arteriovenous shunt. When the aneurysm was incised after the clamping of the 
abdominal aorta, massive venous bleeding occurred from the fistula and caused 
severe hypotension. Blood pressure recovered by digital compression of the 
bleeding point and the use of an autotransfusion device. After the repair of the 
aortocaval fistula, the hemodynamics became stable. The patient had a high 
output but a good cardiac function in preoperative examination. Therefore 
anesthesia was managed successfully without worsening high-output heart failure.

Renal thrombotic microangiopathy in a patient with septic disseminated 
intravascular coagulation.

BACKGROUND: The mechanism for the development of thrombotic microangiopathy 
(TMA) during sepsis has only been partially elucidated. TMA is recognized as a 
disease caused by various factors, and may be involved in the emergence of organ 
damage in severe sepsis. Here we report a case of TMA that followed disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to severe infection in a patient with a 
reduced ADAMTS-13 activity level.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 86-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital 
because of low back pain and fever. A careful evaluation led to a diagnosis of 
acute obstructive pyelonephritis due to a ureteral stone. Proteus mirabilis was 
isolated from both blood and urine cultures. The patient developed systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome and DIC, and was treated with antibiotics and 
daily continuous hemodiafiltration. Although infection and the coagulation 
abnormalities due to DIC were successfully controlled, renal failure persisted 
and her consciousness level deteriorated progressively in association with 
severe thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. We therefore 
suspected the presence of TMA and started plasma exchange, which resulted in an 
impressive improvement in consciousness as well as the laboratory abnormalities. 
The ADAMTS-13 activity was 44% and the patient tested negative for the ADAMTS-13 
inhibitor prior to the initiation of plasma exchange. A renal biopsy was 
performed to determine the etiology of acute renal injury, which revealed 
findings that were interpreted to be compatible with the sequelae of TMA. The 
follow-up studies performed after the successful treatment of TMA showed that 
her plasma ADAMTS-13 activity level remained persistently low. It is surmised 
that septic DIC occurring in the presence of preexisting reduced ADAMTS-13 
activity have led to the development of secondary TMA in the present case.
CONCLUSION: The present case suggests that TMA can be superimposed on 
sepsis-induced DIC, and plasma exchange is expected to be beneficial in such 
situations. Clinicians should consider the possibility of secondary TMA that 
follows sepsis-induced DIC in certain indicative clinical settings.

Acupuncture treatment of chronic low back pain reverses an abnormal brain 
default mode network in correlation with clinical pain relief.

BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is gaining in popularity as a treatment for chronic low 
back pain (cLBP); however, its therapeutic mechanisms remain controversial, 
partly because of the absence of an objective way of measuring subjective pain. 
Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) has demonstrated aberrant default mode 
network (DMN) connectivity in patients with chronic pain, and also shown that 
acupuncture increases DMN connectivity in pain-modulator and affective-emotional 
brain regions of healthy subjects.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore how cLBP influences the DMN and whether, 
and how, the altered DMN connectivity is reversed after acupuncture for clinical 
pain.
METHODS: RsfMRI data from 20 patients with cLBP, before and after 4 weeks of 
treatment, and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (without treatment) 
were analysed using independent components analyses to determine connectivity 
within the DMN, and combined with correlation analyses to compute covariance 
between changes in DMN connectivity and changes in clinical pain. Visual 
analogue scale data were assessed to rate clinical pain levels.
RESULTS: Less connectivity within the DMN was found in patients with cLBP than 
in healthy controls, mainly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial 
prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus. After acupuncture, 
patients' connectivities were restored almost to the levels seen in healthy 
controls. Furthermore, reductions in clinical pain were correlated with 
increases in DMN connectivity.
CONCLUSIONS: This result suggests that modulation of the DMN by acupuncture is 
related to its therapeutic effects on cLBP. Imaging of the DMN provides an 
objective method for assessment of the effects of acupuncture-induced analgesia.

of Sydney, Australia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to 
identify pathology responsible for low back pain (LBP). However, the importance 
of findings on MRI remains controversial. We aimed to systematically review 
whether MRI findings of the lumbar spine predict future LBP in different samples 
with and without LBP.
DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were 
searched. Included were prospective cohort studies investigating the 
relationship between baseline MRI abnormalities of the lumbar spine and 
clinically important LBP outcome at follow-up. We excluded cohorts with specific 
diseases as the cause of their LBP. Associations between MRI findings and LBP 
pain outcomes were extracted from eligible studies.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies presented 
data on participants with current LBP; one included a sample with no current 
LBP, three included a sample with no history of LBP and two included mixed 
samples. Due to small sample size, poor overall quality and the heterogeneity 
between studies in terms of participants, MRI findings and clinical outcomes 
investigated, it was not possible to pool findings. No consistent associations 
between MRI findings and outcomes were identified. Single studies reported 
significant associations for Modic changes type 1 with pain, disc degeneration 
with disability in samples with current LBP and disc herniation with pain in a 
mixed sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The limited number, heterogeneity and overall quality of the 
studies do not permit definite conclusions on the association of MRI findings of 
the lumbar spine with future LBP (PROSPERO: CRD42012002342).

A reduction in gray matter volume is common in patients with chronic back pain, 
and different types of pain are associated with gray matter abnormalities in 
distinct brain regions. To examine differences in brain morphology in patients 
with low back pain or neck and upper back pain, we investigated changes in gray 
matter volume in chronic back pain patients having different sites of pain using 
voxel-based morphometry. A reduction in cortical gray matter volume was found 
primarily in the left postcentral gyrus and in the left precuneus and bilateral 
cuneal cortex of patients with low back pain. In these patients, there was an 
increase in subcortical gray matter volume in the bilateral putamen and 
accumbens, right pallidum, right caudate nucleus, and left amygdala. In upper 
back pain patients, reduced cortical gray matter volume was found in the left 
precentral and left postcentral cortices. Our findings suggest that regional 
gray matter volume abnormalities in low back pain patients are more extensive 
than in upper back pain patients. Subcortical gray matter volume increases are 
found only in patients with low back pain.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Evidence supporting an association between obesity and low 
back pain (LBP) continues to grow; yet little is known about the cause and 
effect of this relationship. Even less is known about the mechanisms linking the 
two. Physical activity is a logical suspect, but no study has demonstrated its 
role.
PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine the interrelationship between 
physical activity, obesity, and LBP. The specific aims were to determine if 
obesity is a risk factor for LBP in the U.S. population, measure the strength of 
any observed association, and evaluate the role of physical activity in 
modulating this association.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A cross-sectional U.S. population-based study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: A cohort of 6,796 adults from the 2003-2004 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information, an in-depth health questionnaire, 
physical examination details, and 7-day free-living physical activity monitoring 
using accelerometry (ActiGraph AM-7164; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA).
METHODS: LBP status was determined by questionnaire response. Body mass index 
(BMI) was calculated during physical examination and divided here into four 
groups (normal weight <25, overweight 25-30, obese 31-35, and ultraobese 36+). 
Summary measures of physical activity were computed based on intensity cutoffs, 
percentile intensities, and bout. Demographics, social history, and comorbid 
health conditions were used to build adjusted weighted logistic regression 
models constructed using Akaike Information Criterion. All displayed estimates 
are significant at level <.05. No external funding was received to support this 
study. None of the authors report conflicts of interest directly related to the 
specific subject matter of this manuscript.
RESULTS: In the U.S. population, the risk of low LBP increases in step with BMI 
from 2.9% for normal BMI (20-25) to 5.2% for overweight (26-30), 7.7% for obese 
(31-35), and 11.6% for ultraobese (36+). Smoking is consistently the strongest 
predictor of LBP across the BMI spectrum (odds ratio 1.6-2.9). Physical activity 
also modulates these risks. In the overall model, the best physical activity 
predictors of LBP are in the moderate and high intensity ranges with small 
effects (odds ratio 0.98 and 0.996 per standard deviation increase, 
respectively). When broken down by BMI, time spent in sedentary and moderate 
activity ranges demonstrate more robust influences on LBP status in the 
overweight, obese, and ultraobese groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI is a risk factor for back pain in Americans. More 
important, the role of physical activity in mitigating back pain risk is shown 
to be of greater consequence in the overweight and obese populations.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of widespread pressure pain sensitivity 
in cancer patients following partial colorectal resection in the abdominal and 
lower back area and to describe the presence of abnormalities in abdominal and 
lower back muscle morphology.
METHODS: Twenty colon cancer survivors (eight females, mean age 56.60 ± 7.76 
years) and 20 matched healthy controls (10 females, mean age 54.22 ± 8.12 years) 
participated. Abdominal and lower back pain was assessed after undergoing 
surgery using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). 
Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were bilaterally assessed over the 
supraumbilical, infraumbilical, and lower back areas and the second metacarpal. 
Ultrasound imaging was used to measure the depth of the abdominal muscles, the 
width of the midline abdominal fascia and the width of the lumbar multifidus.
RESULTS: Ten months after finishing oncological treatments, patients who 
underwent partial colorectal resection reported significantly higher pain levels 
in the low-back area (P = 0.003) but not in the abdominal area (P = 0.426) 
compared with the matched controls. After surgery, the colon patients reported 
significantly higher BPI-intensity (P < 0.001) and BPI-interference scores 
(P = 0.009) compared with the matched controls. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
revealed significant between-groups difference in dominant-side lumbar, 
supraumbilical and infraumbilical (P ≥ 0.01), and second-metacarpal (P < 0.05) 
PPT levels. A significant between-groups difference was found by the ANOVA in 
ultrasound imaging of the depth of the internal oblique muscle (F = 4.887, 
P = 0.035) but not in the other ultrasound imaging measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: Ten months after oncology treatment, colon cancer survivors show 
widespread pressure pain muscle hyperalgesia and reduced depths of dominant-side 
internal oblique muscles compared with matched controls.

A full-term male infant presented shortly after birth with respiratory distress. 
An echocardiogram done within the first hour of life showed an elevated 
pulmonary artery pressure, an associated right ventricular hypertrophy without a 
patent ductus arteriosus. The patient was treated for persistent pulmonary 
hypertension with favorable response. Maternal history was unremarkable except 
for chronic low back pain treated with cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril®). A proposed 
mechanism for cyclobenzaprine includes inhibition of norepinephrine and 
serotonin reuptake, factors known to inhibit prostaglandin and nitric oxide. 
These two factors are the leading causes of in-utero ductal closure. This report 
is the first to indicate that cyclobenzaprine use during late pregnancy should 
be considered a potential cause of early ductal closure.

BACKGROUND: Orthoses are external aids that are often used to treat pain and 
diseases affecting the spine, such as lumbago, whiplash, and disc herniation. In 
this review, we assess the effectiveness and complications of orthotic treatment 
for typical spinal conditions and after spinal surgery. The orthotic treatment 
of fractures and postural abnormalities are beyond the scope of this article.
METHOD: This review is based on a selective search in the Medline database with 
consideration of controlled trials, systematic reviews, and the recommendations 
of the relevant medical societies.
RESULTS: Three relevant systematic reviews and four controlled trials were 
found. Very few controlled trials to date have studied the efficacy of orthotic 
treatment compared to other conservative treatments and surgery. No definitive 
evidence was found to support the use of orthoses after surgery, in lumbar 
radiculopathy, or after whiplash injuries of the cervical spine. In a single 
trial, short-term immobilization was an effective treatment of cervical 
radiculopathy. Orthoses are not recommended for nonspecific low back pain. The 
potential complications of cervical orthoses include pressure-related skin 
injuries and dysphagia.
CONCLUSION: No definitive evidence as yet supports the use of orthoses after 
spinal interventions or in painful conditions of the cervical or lumbar spine. 
They should, therefore, be used only after individual consideration of the 
indications in each case.

Collecting system duplication is marked by a variety of clinical syndromes. 
Bilateral and obstructed duplicated systems, particularly with asymmetric levels 
of duplication, are rare and typically due to ureteric bud development 
anomalies. The infrequency with which this condition exists makes it a 
formidable challenge for physicians and patients. To our knowledge, we present 
the first case report of bilateral obstruction of bilaterally duplicated 
collecting systems. In our case, a 52-year-old male complaining of low back 
pain, constipation, urinary urgency and hematuria was found to have bilateral 
obstructing stones as well as asymmetrical bilateral collecting system 
duplication. We discuss the natural history of this condition, its consequences 
and identification.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has limited diagnostic 
value for chronic low back pain because of the unclear relationship between any 
anatomic abnormalities on MRI and pain reported by the patient. Assessing the 
innervation of end plate and disc pathologies-and determining the relationship 
between these pathologies and any abnormalities seen on MRI-could clarify the 
sources of back pain and help identify abnormalities with enhanced diagnostic 
value.
PURPOSE: To quantify innervation in the vertebral end plate and intervertebral 
disc and to relate variation in innervation to the presence of pathologic 
features observed by histology and conventional MRI.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A cross-sectional histology and imaging study of vertebral 
end plates and intervertebral discs harvested from human cadaver spines.
METHODS: We collected 92 end plates and 46 intervertebral discs from seven 
cadaver spines (ages 51-67 years). Before dissection, the spines were scanned 
with MRI to grade for Modic changes and high-intensity zones (HIZ). Standard 
immunohistochemical techniques were used to localize the general nerve marker 
protein gene product 9.5. We quantified innervation in the following 
pathologies: fibrovascular end-plate marrow, fatty end-plate marrow, end-plate 
defects, and annular tears.
RESULTS: Nerves were present in the majority of end plates with fibrovascular 
marrow, fatty marrow, and defects. Nerve density was significantly higher in 
fibrovascular end-plate marrow than in normal end-plate marrow (p<.001). Of the 
end plates with fibrovascular and fatty marrow, less than 40% were Modic on MRI. 
Innervated marrow pathologies collocated with more than 75% of the end plate 
defects; hence, innervation was significantly higher in end plate defects than 
in normal end plates (p<.0001). In the disc, nerves were observed in only 35% of 
the annular tears; in particular, innervation in radial tears tended to be 
higher than in normal discs (p=.07). Of the discs with radial tears, less than 
13% had HIZ on T2 MRI. Innervation was significantly less in radial tears than 
in fibrovascular end-plate marrow (p=.05) and end-plate defects (p=.02).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that vertebral end-plate pathologies are 
more innervated than intervertebral disc pathologies and that many innervated 
end-plate pathologies are not detectable on MRI. Taken together, these findings 
suggest that improved visualization of end-plate pathologies could enhance the 
diagnostic value of MRI for chronic low back pain.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Sacral rib represents an uncommon pathology in which 
rib-like structures arise from the sacrum. Supernumerary ribs may occur at any 
level of the spine, but supernumerary ribs in the sacrococcygeal area are 
extremely rare.
PURPOSE: To present the case of a patient with sacral rib and to discuss this 
entity with reference to the literature.
STUDY DESIGN: A case report and literature review.
METHODS: A 17-year-old girl presented with low back pain and discomfort in 
bilateral gluteal regions. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of the 
pelvis showed a smooth-surfaced, rod-like bony structure attaching to the sacrum 
on the left side. The appearance was consistent with sacral rib. The sacrum was 
hypoplastic and deviated to the right. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 
insertion of the gluteus maximus (GM) onto the coccyx only on the right side. 
The sacral rib existed beneath the left GM muscle and received a partial 
insertion from the left GM muscle. No ligamentous continuation between the 
sacral rib and coccyx was observed.
RESULTS: Conservative treatment relieved symptoms, so no surgical intervention 
was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Sacral rib is a rare congenital anomaly for which surgical 
intervention is usually unnecessary. However, appropriate workups with CT and/or 
MRI should be considered for women, because sacral rib may cause complications 
during childbirth. In the literature, sacral/coccygeal rib is sometimes called 
"pelvic rib." However, sacral/coccygeal rib should be distinguished from pelvic 
rib, because pelvic rib originating from the ilium is considered to represent a 
different entity.

Lumbar lordosis is a key postural component that has interested both clinicians 
and researchers for many years. Despite its wide use in assessing postural 
abnormalities, there remain many unanswered questions regarding lumbar lordosis 
measurements. Therefore, in this article we reviewed different factors 
associated with the lordosis angle based on existing literature and determined 
normal values of lordosis. We reviewed more than 120 articles that measure and 
describe the different factors associated with the lumbar lordosis angle. 
Because of a variety of factors influencing the evaluation of lumbar lordosis 
such as how to position the patient and the number of vertebrae included in the 
calculation, we recommend establishing a uniform method of evaluating the 
lordosis angle. Based on our review, it seems that the optimal position for 
radiologic measurement of lordosis is standing with arms supported while 
shoulders are flexed at a 30° angle. There is evidence that many factors, such 
as age, gender, body mass index, ethnicity, and sport, may affect the lordosis 
angle, making it difficult to determine uniform normal values. Normal lordosis 
should be determined based on the specific characteristics of each individual; 
we therefore presented normal lordosis values for different groups/populations. 
There is also evidence that the lumbar lordosis angle is positively and 
significantly associated with spondylolysis and isthmic spondylolisthesis. 
However, no association has been found with other spinal degenerative features. 
Inconclusive evidence exists for association between lordosis and low back pain. 
Additional studies are needed to evaluate these associations. The optimal 
lordotic range remains unknown and may be related to a variety of individual 
factors such as weight, activity, muscular strength, and flexibility of the 
spine and lower extremities.

INTRODUCTION: The Currarino syndrome is regarded as a developmental disorder 
based on its recognized etiological heterogeneity. This syndrome is thought to 
result from abnormal separation of the neuroectoderm from the endoderm. Our aim 
was to report the neurosurgical management of Currarino syndrome in children and 
adults and to describe what clinician could do if the Currarino triad was 
suspected.
CASE REPORTS: We present five cases of Currarino triad who underwent surgical 
intervention. All patients had sacral bony deformity, anorectal malformations, 
and anterior sacral meningocele. A 40-year-old-male had chronic constipation. He 
was incidentally diagnosed with Currarino syndrome. A 19-year-old-female 
suffered from a slight weakness in lower extremities and urinary incontinence. 
Her past medical history was remarkable for anal atresia. The other three cases 
were children.
CONCLUSION: When an anterior sacral meningocele is encountered, Currarino 
syndrome should be taken into consideration. Although it is rarity, the 
Currarino syndrome might be one of the causes of chronic constipation. 
Endoscopic or endoscope-assisted surgery via a posterior sacral route can be 
feasible for treatment of some of the patients with anterior sacral meningocele. 
Anterior meningocele pouch associated with Currarino syndrome will regresses 
over time following transdural ligation of its neck.

BACKGROUND: Intrathecal (IT) enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human 
α-L-iduronidase (rhIDU) has been studied to treat glycosaminoglycan storage in 
the central nervous system of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I dogs and is 
currently being studied in MPS I patients.
METHODS: We studied the immune response to IT rhIDU in MPS I subjects with 
spinal cord compression who had been previously treated with intravenous rhIDU. 
We measured the concentrations of specific antibodies and cytokines in serum and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected before monthly IT rhIDU infusions and 
compared the serologic findings with clinical adverse event (AE) reports to 
establish temporal correlations with clinical symptoms.
RESULTS: Five MPS I subjects participating in IT rhIDU trials were studied. One 
subject with symptomatic spinal cord compression had evidence of an inflammatory 
response with CSF leukocytosis, elevated interleukin-5, and elevated 
immunoglobulin G. This subject also complained of lower back pain and buttock 
paresthesias temporally correlated with serologic abnormalities. Clinical 
symptoms were managed with oral medication, and serologic abnormalities were 
resolved, although this subject withdrew from the trial to have spinal 
decompressive surgery.
CONCLUSION: IT rhIDU was generally well tolerated in the subjects studied, 
although one subject had moderate to severe clinical symptoms and serologic 
abnormalities consistent with an immune response.

Marfan syndrome and symptomatic sacral cyst: report of two cases.

Arnold PM(1), Teuber J.

Author information:
(1)University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA. parnold@kumc.edu

CONTEXT: Meningeal abnormalities such as dural ectasia are seen in Marfan 
syndrome, but spinal meningeal cysts are rarely seen. These cysts usually 
asymptomatic and often found incidentally on magnetic resonance imaging, large 
cysts may cause neurological deficits and pain secondary to nerve root 
compression.
DESIGN: Case reports.
FINDINGS: Two patients with Marfan syndrome presented with urinary symptoms 
secondary to dural ectasia and sacral cysts. Patient 1 had a history of low back 
pain, erectile dysfunction, and occasional urinary incontinence and groin pain 
with recent symptom worsening. He underwent L5 partial laminectomy and S1-S2 
laminectomy with sacral cyst decompression. Nine weeks later, he underwent 
drainage of a sacral pseudomeningocele. Pain and urinary symptoms resolved, and 
he remains neurologically normal 2 years after surgery. Patient 2 presented 
after a fall on his tailbone, complaining of low back pain and difficulty 
urinating. Physical therapy was implemented, but after 4 weeks, urinary 
retention had not improved. He then underwent resection of the sacral cyst and 
S1-S3 laminectomy. Pain and paresthesias resolved and bowel function returned to 
normal. Other than needing intermittent self-catheterization, all other 
neurologic findings were normal 30 months after surgery.
CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgical goals for sacral cysts include resection 
as well as closure of the dura, which can be challenging due to thinning from 
ectasia. Neurosurgical intervention in Marfan syndrome is associated with a high 
risk of dural tears and osseous complications, and should be performed only when 
symptoms are severe.

BACKGROUND: Degenerative processes can cause chronic low back pain that 
occasionally creates impingement of the lumbar dorsal rami, resulting in a 
clinical syndrome previously described as lumbar dorsal ramus syndrome (LDRS).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical basis of LDRS by comparing pain, 
disability, and objective measures of pathophysiology in 3 groups of subjects 
defined by needle electromyography examination (NEE) findings.
DESIGN: Prospective group cohort study with retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Veterans Affairs medical center outpatient clinic.
PATIENTS: Subjects who had undergone lower limb NEE and lumbar magnetic 
resonance imaging.
METHODS: A total of 71 subjects' records that met the study criteria were 
retrospectively reviewed for interventional spine procedures performed and to 
measure the lumbosacral paraspinal cross-sectional area (PSP CSA); 28 of the 71 
subjects underwent further clinical assessment. One-way analysis of variance was 
performed to evaluate group differences.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: In the retrospective arm: (1) PSP CSAs measured at 4 
lower lumbar disk levels (average of 3 consecutive slices/level) bilaterally and 
overall left and right lumbar average PSP CSA and (2) the frequency and type of 
interventional spine procedures performed. In the prospective arm: (1) temporal 
changes of NEE abnormalities, (2) pain measured using the Visual Analog Scale, 
(3) Pain Disability Questionnaire responses, and (4) Short Form-36 scores.
RESULTS: The right L5 CSA was significantly greater in the group with mechanical 
low back pain compared with the group with lumbar radicular syndrome (F = 3.3; P 
< .05). No significant group differences were noted in the number of spine 
procedures performed. No significant differences in pain or disability scores 
were found among the groups. NEE findings improved over time predominantly in 
the LDRS group.
CONCLUSIONS: LDRS is a diagnosis with identifiable NEE (lumbar multifidus 
denervation) findings and magnetic resonance imaging findings that may include 
lower lumbar paraspinal atrophy. NEE (paraspinal denervation) findings in 
persons with LDRS may change over time, and the clinical relevance of LDRS to 
pain, functional disability, and treatment response is unclear.

Imperforate hymen in an adolescent usually presents with cyclic abdominal pain 
or with pelvic mass associated with primary amenorrhea. We present a 13-year-old 
girl with chronic lower back pain of 6 months' duration as the only complaint. 
On physical examination, multiple trigger points were detected in the quadratus 
lumborum and gluteus medius muscles bilaterally. Abdominal ultrasound revealed 
hematometrocolpos secondary to an imperforate hymen. Hymenectomy was performed, 
with complete resolution of the back pain. Myofascial pain syndrome with a 
viscerosomatic reflex is a possible explanation for the clinical presentation of 
our patient.

preliminary investigation.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to establish if people with chronic 
low back pain (CLBP) demonstrate impairments in the ability to localize sensory 
information delivered to the back more than pain-free controls and determine 
whether any sensory abnormalities are related to pain-related variables.
METHODS: Vision was occluded and participants were stimulated using light touch 
or pinprick over a number of body areas in random order. To assess for 
mislocalizations participants were asked to nominate the location of each 
stimulus in reference to a marked body chart. To assess referred sensations 
participants who were asked whether they experienced any sensations elsewhere 
during stimulation. If referred sensations were reported, testing was repeated 
with visualization of the stimulated area.
RESULTS: Although a small number of CLBP patients demonstrated referral of 
sensations, this was not statistically different from what was observed in a 
pain-free control group (P=0.381). In contrast, mislocalizations were very 
common in the patient sample and statistically more common than we found in 
controls (P=0.034). No statistically significant associations were detected 
between sensory function and the measured pain-related variables (all P>0.05).
DISCUSSION: These data add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that 
disturbed self-perception is a feature of CLBP. It is plausible that altered 
self-perception is maladaptive and contributes to the maintenance of the problem 
and may represent a target of treatment for CLBP.

Apparent lisinopril overdose requiring hemodialysis.

Belay TW(1), Nusair AR.

Author information:

University, Huntington, WV 25701, USA. belayti@marshall.edu

PURPOSE: A case of apparent overdose of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors 
requiring hemodialysis is reported.
SUMMARY: A 51-year-old white man (weight, 85 kg; height, 178 cm; body mass 
index, 28) with a history of hypertension, low back pain, and anxiety apparently 
took 27 lisinopril 10-mg tablets (3.18 mg/kg body weight) over a period of 3 or 
fewer days. The friend who brought him to the emergency department reported that 
the patient was hard to rouse and was speaking incoherently on the day of 
admission. Over the previous few days, the patient reportedly had visual 
hallucinations, incoherence, and inarticulate speech. Laboratory tests, 
electrocardiography, and computed tomography were performed. The patient was 
judged to have high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, severe 
hyperkalemia, and rhabdomyolysis. He was given three doses of albuterol via a 
nebulizer, three doses of calcium gluconate 1 g i.v., two doses of sodium 
bicarbonate 100 meq i.v., two doses of sodium polystyrene sulfonate 30 g orally, 
three doses of insulin 10 units i.v., and three doses of dextrose 25 g (as 50% 
dextrose injection) i.v. He then underwent emergent hemodialysis and was 
admitted to the intensive care unit. The patient's confusion abated, kidney 
function improved, and acid-base and electrolyte imbalances resolved. The 
patient was discharged after 15 days.
CONCLUSION: A man who had evidently taken an overdose of lisinopril had 
multiorgan dysfunction in the absence of hypotension. The abnormalities resolved 
after he was treated for acidosis and hyperkalemia and received hemodialysis to 
remove the lisinopril.

BACKGROUND: Several risk factors have been proposed for intervertebral disc 
degeneration (DD) among adolescent athletes. However, the causes of DD are not 
well understood, and there have been few prospective studies evaluating DD in 
adolescents.
PURPOSE: To identify risk factors for DD among adolescent American football (AF) 
players.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: This study investigated the relationships between the progression of DD 
and the following factors: lumbar spine abnormalities on baseline radiographs, 
body mass index, AF position played (lineman or other), and length of playing 
career (2 full competitive AF seasons or <2 seasons). Included were 192 students 
who joined a top-ranked high school AF team from 2004 to 2008. Of these, 160 
played for 2 full competitive AF seasons. The remaining 32 players, who stopped 
before completing 2 seasons, were used as a control group. Baseline radiographs 
and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained when the players 
enrolled in the AF team in May, and follow-up lumbar MRI scans were obtained 2 
years later at the end of their second academic year in March. Disc degeneration 
was measured by the signal intensity of the nucleus pulposus, and its 
progression was evaluated by multiple regression analysis of decreases in signal 
intensity. Also analyzed was the relationship between DD and low back pain 
(LBP).
RESULTS: The mean decrease in signal intensity of the nucleus pulposus was 4.30% 
± 11.63% in players who completed 2 AF seasons and 1.41% ± 10.03% in those who 
did not (P = .12). Mean visual analog scale scores for LBP at follow-up were 
significantly higher (P = .001) in players who had played for 2 full seasons 
(2.67 ± 2.81) than in those with a shorter career (0.99 ± 1.61). Decreases in 
signal intensity of the nucleus pulposus after 2 years of playing AF related 
significantly to playing a lineman position (partial regression coefficient, 
3.47%), the presence of Schmorl nodes (partial regression coefficient, 3.58%), 
and disc herniation (partial regression coefficient, 4.09%).
CONCLUSION: Significant risk factors for DD progression in high school AF 
players included playing a lineman position, the presence of Schmorl nodes, and 
disc herniation. Continuing to play AF through 2 years of high school was a risk 
factor for the onset of LBP.

Lower-back injury from snow shovelling may be related to excessive joint 
loading. Bent-shaft snow shovels are commonly available for purchase; however, 
their influence on lower back-joint loading is currently not known. Therefore, 
the purpose of this study was to compare L5/S1 extension angular impulses 
between a bent-shaft and a standard straight-shaft snow shovel. Eight healthy 
subjects participated in this study. Each completed a simulated snow-lifting 
task in a biomechanics laboratory with each shovel design. A standard motion 
analysis procedure was used to determine L5/S1 angular impulses during each 
trial, as well as peak L5/S1 extension moments and peak upper body flexion 
angle. Paired-samples t-tests (α = 0.05) were used to compare variables between 
shovel designs. Correlation was used to determine the relationship between peak 
flexion and peak moments. Results of this study show that the bent-shaft snow 
shovel reduced L5/S1 extension angular impulses by 16.5% (p = 0.022), decreased 
peak moments by 11.8% (p = 0.044), and peak flexion by 13.0% (p = 0.002) 
compared to the straight-shaft shovel. Peak L5/S1 extension moment magnitude was 
correlated with peak upper body flexion angle (r = 0.70). Based on these 
results, it is concluded that the bent-shaft snow shovel can likely reduce 
lower-back joint loading during snow shovelling, and thus may have a role in 
snow shovelling injury prevention.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Surfing is an uncommon cause of an acute nontraumatic 
myelopathy. This study describes the MR imaging characteristics and clinical 
correlates in 23 subjects with surfer's myelopathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 23 cases of surfer's 
myelopathy from 2003-2012. Spinal cord MR imaging characteristics and neurologic 
examinations with the use of the American Spinal Injury Association scale were 
reviewed. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between MR 
imaging characteristics, American Spinal Injury Association scale, and clinical 
improvement.
RESULTS: All subjects (19 male, 4 female; mean age, 26.3 ± 7.4 years) 
demonstrated "pencil-like," central T2-hyperintense signal abnormalities in the 
spinal cord extending from the midthoracic region to the conus with associated 
cord expansion and varying degrees of conus enlargement on spinal cord MR 
imaging within 24 hours of symptom onset. T1 signal was normal. Faint gadolinium 
enhancement was present in a minority. Although there was a strong correlation 
between initial American Spinal Injury Association score and clinical 
improvement (P = .0032), MR imaging characteristics were not associated with 
American Spinal Injury Association score or clinical improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Surfer's myelopathy should be considered in the radiographic 
differential diagnosis of a longitudinally extensive T2-hyperintense spinal cord 
lesion. MR imaging characteristics do not appear to be associated with severity 
on examination or clinical improvement.

Stabilization of the sacroiliac joint.

Shaffrey CI, Smith JS.

Lower back pain and pain involving the area of the posterior iliac spine are 
extremely common. Degeneration of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is one potential 
cause for lower back pain and pain radiating into the groin or buttocks. 
Degenerative changes to the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints are common. A 
recent study evaluating SIJ abnormalities in a primary low back pain population 
demonstrated 31.7% of patients demonstrated SI joint abnormalities. (4) As is 
the case for the evaluation and management of isolated lower back pain, the 
evaluation, management, and role for surgical intervention in SIJ pain is very 
controversial. Many patients have degenerative changes of the disc, facet 
joints, and SIJs. A recent systematic review performed to determine the 
diagnostic accuracy of tests available to clinicians to identify the disc, facet 
joint, or SIJ as the source of low back pain concluded that tests do exist that 
change the probability of the disc or SIJ (but not the facet joint) as the 
source of low back pain. (3) It was also concluded that the usefulness of these 
tests in clinical practice, particularly for guiding treatment selection, 
remains unclear. (3) Although there is general agreement that SIJ pathological 
changes are a potential cause of pain, there is far less agreement about the 
optimal management of these conditions. A variety of conditions can cause SIJ 
dysfunction including degenerative and inflammatory arthritis, trauma, prior 
lumbosacral fusion, hip arthritis, limb length inequality, infections, and 
neoplasia. (8) There is increasing evidence that image intensifier-guided single 
periarticular injection can correctly localize pain to the SIJ but the optimal 
management strategy remains controversial. Recent publications have compared 
surgical versus injection treatments and fusion versus denervation procedures. 
(1 , 8) A systematic review found improvement regardless of the treatment, with 
most studies reporting over 40% improvement in pain as measured by VAS or NRS 
scores. (8) It cautioned that one of the studies reported 17.6% of patients 
experiencing mild/no pain compared with 82.4% experiencing marked/severe pain at 
39 months after SIJ fusion procedures. (6 , 8) This systematic review also noted 
that despite improvements in reported pain, less than half of patients who had 
work status reported as returning to work. (8) Because of the functional and 
socioeconomic consequences of chronic lower back pain, numerous surgical 
treatments to improve this condition have been attempted by spinal surgeons 
through the years. Arthrodesis of the SIJ is a surgical procedure with a long 
history dating to the beginnings of spinal surgery. (7) Poor results, high 
complication rates and the need for additional surgical procedures have 
generally diminished the enthusiasm for this procedure until recently. (6) A 
variety of "minimally invasive" procedures have been recently introduced that 
have rekindled enthusiasm for the surgical management of SIJ pathology. The 
technique demonstrated in the "Stabilization of the SIJ with SI-Bone" is one of 
these new techniques. There has been a recent publication detailing the very 
short term clinical outcomes with this technique that reported encouraging 
results. (5) In this series of 50 patients, quality of life questionnaires were 
available for 49 patients preoperatively, 41 patients at 3 months, 40 at 6 
months and only 27 at 12 months, complicating the ability to accurately assess 
true outcomes. Although the focus of this video by Geisler is on the surgical 
technique, there should have been more information provided on the expected 
surgical outcomes and potential complications of SIJ fusion. (2) The video only 
gives minimal information on how to appropriately select patients with potential 
SIJ pathology for surgical intervention. There are insufficient recommendations 
on the clinical and radiographic follow-up needed for this procedure. A concern 
with this implant is whether the porous plasma spray coating on the implant 
actually results in bone growth across the SIJ or only serves as a stabilizer. 
If true fusion does not result, deterioration in the clinical result could occur 
over time. This video nicely demonstrates the surgical technique of 
stabilization of the SIJ with SI-Bone product. There are numerous unanswered 
questions regarding patient selection for SIJ fusion or stabilization. There are 
an increasing number of surgical techniques for treating SIJ pathology and it is 
not clear which method may provide the best outcomes. Without prospective trials 
with nonconflicted surgeons and standardized selection criteria, the true role 
for SIJ fusion procedures in the management of chronic lower back pain will 
remain murky. The consequences of the unsupported enthusiasm for the surgical 
management of discogenic back pain still negatively impacts the public 
perception of spinal surgeons. Much more high quality information is needed 
regarding the surgical management of SIJ pathology before widespread use of this 
technique should be adopted.

Patients with inferior vena cava thrombosis frequently present with lower back 
pain and bilateral lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis.

Comment in
    Vasa. 2013 Jul;42(4):235-6.

BACKGROUND: Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is rare, and data about the 
clinical presentation of patients are scarce. Therefore, we reviewed all cases 
of IVC thrombosis consecutively registered in the MAISTHRO 
(MAin-ISar-THROmbosis) database and described patients characteristics in terms 
of their clinical presentations in the acute setting of IVC thrombosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the MAISTHRO registry, which enrolled 1470 
consecutive patients with documented histories of venous thromboembolism, we 
identified 60 patients (0,4 %; females 60 %) with IVC thrombosis and 888 
patients (60.4 %; females 55 %) with isolated lower-extremity deep vein 
thrombosis (LE-DVT).
RESULTS: The median age at the time of IVC thrombosis manifestation was 36.5 
years (9 to 83). IVC thrombosis was the initial VTE event in 47 patients (78 %). 
In the majority of cases, IVC thrombosis extended to the lower-extremity veins, 
and both lower extremities were affected in 17 cases (28 %). The initial 
clinical symptom of IVC thrombosis was lower back or abdominal pain which 
preceded typical symptoms of LE-DVT in 29 (48 %) patients. Symptomatic pulmonary 
embolism was more frequently observed in IVC thrombosis patients when compared 
to a sex- and age-matched subgroup of LE-DVT patients, although the difference 
was not significant (27 % vs. 12 %; p = 0.064). Malignant disease was the only 
established VTE risk factor with a higher prevalence among IVC thrombosis 
patients than patients with isolated LE-DVT (27 % vs. 9 %; p = 0.015). 
Congenital IVC anomalies were identified in another eight IVC thrombosis 
patients (13 %).
CONCLUSIONS: IVC thrombosis should be considered a differential diagnosis for 
inexplicable lower back or abdominal pain especially in young patients. 
Malignant disease and congenital IVC anomalies seem to be predisposing factors 
for thrombosis involving the inferior vena cava.

Publisher: Hintergrund: Thrombosen mit Beteiligung der Vena cava inferior (VCI) 
sind extrem selten und es fehlen Daten, wie sich Patienten mit dieser 
Thromboseform klinisch präsentieren. Anhand unseres prospektiven 
Thromboseregisters MAISTHRO haben wir ein Kollektiv von VCI-Thrombosepatienten 
zusammengestellt und stellen hier die klinischen Charakteristika dieser 
Patientengruppe dar. Patienten und Methoden: Aus dem MAISTHRO-Register, in dem 
1470 konsekutive Patientenfälle mit venöser Thromboembolie erfasst sind, konnten 
wir 60 Patienten (0,4 %; Frauenanteil 60 %) mit VCI-Thrombose und 888 Patienten 
(60,4 %; Frauenanteil 55 %) mit isolierter tiefer Beinvenenthrombose 
identifizieren. Ergebnisse: Bei den VCI-Thrombosepatienten lag das 
Manifestationsalter im Median bei 36.5 Jahren (Range 9-83). In 47 Fällen (78 %) 
war die VCI-Thrombose das erste Thromboseereignis. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle 
dehnte sich die VCI-Thrombose auf die Becken- und Beinvenen aus; eine 
beidseitige Thrombose fand sich in 17 Fällen (28 %). Gefragt nach der 
Initialsymptomatik gaben 29 (48 %) der Patienten Rücken- und Bauchschmerzen an, 
für die sich kein anderes pathologisches Korrelat finden ließ. Erst mit 
zeitlicher Latenz trat die typische Klinik einer Beinvenenthrombose hinzu. 
Symptomatische Lungenembolien waren häufiger bei VCI-Thrombose als bei 
isolierter Beinvenenthrombose, auch wenn der Unterschied nicht signifikant war 
(27 % vs. 12 %; p = 0,064). Eine maligne Erkrankung war der einzige etablierte 
Risikofaktor, der häufiger bei VCI-Thrombosepatienten als bei Patienten mit 
isolierter Beinvenenthrombose vorkam (27 % vs. 9 %; p = 0,015). Angeborene 
Anomalien der Vena cava inferior fanden sich hingegen bei 8 Patienten mit einer 
VCI-Thrombose (13 %). Schlussfolgerungen: Eine Thrombose der Vena cava inferior 
sollte als Differenzialdiagnose in Betracht gezogen werden bei zunächst 
unerklärlichen Rücken- oder Bauchschmerzen, insbesondere wenn jüngere Patienten 
betroffen sind. Malignome und angeborene VCI-Anomalien scheinen prädisponierende 
Faktoren für die Entstehung einer VCI-Thrombose zu sein.

Neurogenic bladder and disc disease: a brief review.

Siracusa G(1), Sparacino A, Lentini VL.

OBJECTIVE: Neurogenic bladder refers to morphofunctional alterations of the 
bladder-sphincter complex secondary to central or peripheral neurological 
lesions. Discal etiology can be suggested by clinical observation in patients 
complaining of classical lower back pain, but not excluded even without 
musculoskeletal pain. This review provides a brief overview of associations 
between neurogenic bladder and disc disease, analyzing neuroanatomy, 
pathophysiology, clinical and urodynamic findings. Therapy is reviewed focusing 
on etiological treatments.
METHODS: The literature search was performed on PubMed, Medline and Google 
scholar using the following keywords: 'neurogenic bladder', 'disc herniation', 
'disc prolapse', 'disc protrusion', 'cauda equina syndrome', 'treatment', 
'surgery', 'urodynamic', either alone or in combination using 'AND' or 'OR'. The 
reference lists of articles retrieved were examined to capture other potentially 
relevant articles. The search was restricted to articles published between 1970 
and 2012. Seventy-nine papers were found, but only 42 were reviewed and 
summarized.
FINDINGS: The literature reviewed confirmed correlations between neurogenic 
bladder and disc disease. Approximately 40% of patients with lumbar disc disease 
have abnormal urodynamic testing, and an even larger proportion complain of 
voiding symptoms. The most common urodynamic finding is detrusor areflexia, but 
underactive or overactive detrusor can also be observed. Electromyography can 
show perineal floor muscle innervation abnormalities. Chronic nervous damage 
induces reduction of bladder sensitivity and detrusor atrophy. An overdistension 
of the bladder follows, with global and circumferential thinning of the bladder 
wall. Overactive detrusor is related to early nerve roots stretching causing an 
irritative state responsible for overstimulation and neurogenic overactivity. 
Detrusor hypertrophy is the anatomical deformation correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: Benefits for neurogenic bladder obtained through disc disease 
treatment should be studied in more detail, especially conservative therapies, 
not yet discussed in literature. Spine surgery effectiveness on voiding function 
should be valued in the light of the latest surgical techniques, considering the 
controversial results reported after laminectomy.

Neuropathic pain in ankylosing spondylitis: a psychophysics and brain imaging 
study.

Wu Q(1), Inman RD, Davis KD.

Author information:
(1)Toronto Western Research Institute at Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, 
Ontario, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a neuropathic component in ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) back pain and to delineate gray matter brain abnormalities 
associated with AS.
METHODS: Seventeen patients with back pain secondary to AS who were not 
receiving biologic agents and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls consented 
to participate in the study and were assessed using the painDETECT instrument 
(scores of ≤12 indicating low probability of neuropathic pain) and the McGill 
Pain Questionnaire. Mechanical and thermal thresholds were determined in all 
subjects, and brain gray matter was assessed by 3T magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Eleven of the 17 AS patients had painDETECT scores of >12. The patients 
had decreased mechanical and cold sensitivity on the dorsum of their feet but 
did not have altered pain thresholds. Compared to controls, the AS patients 
exhibited cortical thinning in the primary somatosensory, insular, anterior 
cingulate, and anterior mid-cingulate cortices and the supplemental motor area, 
and increased gray matter volume in the thalamus and putamen. Scores on the 
painDETECT in AS patients were correlated with decreased gray matter in the 
primary somatosensory cortex and with increased gray matter in the motor cortex, 
anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and striatum.
CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that neuropathic pain occurs in AS. 
Furthermore, abnormal brain gray matter and neural correlates of neuropathic 
pain are concordant with the clinical picture of AS, which includes sensorimotor 
and mood deficits as well as neuropathic pain symptoms. These results suggest 
that back pain in AS is a mixed pain condition that includes a neuropathic pain 
component.

BACKGROUND: Posterior lumbar instruments made of titanium and its alloys could 
change the physiological distribution of load at the instrumented and adjacent 
segments, which is a main cause of implant failure, non-fusion and adjacent 
segment degeneration. Posterior lumbar rods made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) 
which is a semirigid alternative to titanium and its alloys have been introduced 
in lumbar fusion. This prospective study compared the radiological and clinical 
outcomes of patients undergoing lumbar fusion with PEEK rods versus titanium 
alloy rods.
METHODS: Using transpedicular fixation and lumbar fusion, 21 patients were 
treated with titanium alloy rods (TI group), and 20 patients with PEEK rods 
(PEEK group). Radiological and clinical outcomes were evaluated, including the 
status of the implanted instruments, fusion rate, lumbar lordosis angle (LA), 
disc space height (DH), visual analog score (VAS) for lower back pain (VAS-BP) 
and leg pain (VAS-LP), Japanese Orthopedic Association scoring system (JOA 
score) and complications.
RESULTS: Clinical VAS-BP, VAS-LP and JOA scores were significantly improved at 3 
months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively as compared with preoperative 
scores in both groups (p < 0.05), with similar levels of improvement observed at 
the same time points postoperatively between the two groups. The overall fusion 
rate was 100 % at the 1-year follow-up for both groups. No significant 
differences in lumbar lordosis angle were found preoperatively, 1 week and 1 
year postoperatively in both groups (p > 0.05). The postoperative increase of 
disc space height and loss of disc space height during the follow-up showed a 
similar extent of change between both groups (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PEEK rods offer a similar radiological and clinical efficacy as 
titanium alloy rods. PEEK rods, as a semirigid implant with unique 
characteristics, may be an effective alternative treatment for patients with 
degenerative lumbar disease in lumbar fusion.

Neurosurgery, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

The authors describe rare cases of congenital hypoplasia of the L-5 pedicles and 
the congenital absence of the left S-1 pedicle in 2 young girls, respectively, 
including the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. Moreover, they review the 
literature on this clinical entity. The patients presented with intractable 
chronic low-back pain. Plain radiographs and 2D CT scanning revealed the 
presence of the aforementioned anomalies. Degenerative changes to adjacent level 
and contralateral facet joints were thought to be the result of overload and 
instability and seemed to have led to spondylolisthesis, micromotion at L-5 and 
S-1, and subsequent low-back pain. The pediatric patients were treated with 
posterior instrumented fusion with good functional outcomes at a minimum 3-month 
follow-up. To the best of the authors' knowledge, these are the first reports of 
intractable low-back pain and spondylolisthesis accompanied by 
hypoplastic-aplastic pedicles at the lumbosacral junction in children.

Contrast mimicking a subarachnoid hemorrhage after lumbar percutaneous epidural 
neuroplasty: a case report.

INTRODUCTION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is one of the most feared acute neurologic 
events. Accurate diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is essential, and computed 
tomography of the brain is the first diagnostic imaging study. However, in rare 
circumstances, a similar appearance may occur in the absence of blood in the 
subarachnoid space. The contrast enhancement of subarachnoid space is a rare 
complication after lumbar percutaneous epidural neuroplasty, with, to the best 
of our knowledge, no previous report in the literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Korean male patient, who underwent a spinal 
operation five years previously at the level of L4 to S1, visited our clinic 
with persistent and aggravating low back pain. An imaging study revealed the 
focal and diffuse disc protrusion at the level of L4/5 and L5/S1. The clinician 
decided to perform a lumbar percutaneous epidural neuroplasty. During the 
procedure, dural adhesion was suspected at the previously operated level, and 
the neuroplasty catheter was malpositioned into the intradural space on the 
first attempt. After the catheter was repositioned, the scheduled epidural 
neuroplasty was completed. Our patient had no definite abnormal neurological 
signs. But, after a day, our patient complained of severe headache with 
sustained high blood pressure without neurological disorientation. Computed 
tomography of his brain showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage-like appearance with 
intracranial air. Sequential angiography, subtractional magnetic resonance 
imaging and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed no abnormalities. 
Follow-up computed tomography after one day revealed no definite intracranial 
hemorrhage, and our patient was discharged with improved low back pain without 
neurological deficit.
CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of contrast mimicking a subarachnoid 
hemorrhage after lumbar percutaneous epidural neuroplasty. The physician should 
keep in mind a rare case like this, and the supine position with head elevation 
is necessary to avoid a similar complication after lumbar percutaneous epidural 
neuroplasty.

Imaging & Interventional Radiology, Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Cancer 
Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China. aifei1021@163.com

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) 
in the detection of early ankylosing spondylitis and explore the manifestations 
of ankylosing spondylitis on whole body DWI (WB-DWI).
METHODS: A total of 16 patients with early ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 18 
patients with low back pain (LBP) were recruited. Subchondral bone marrow 
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in bilateral ilium and sacrum along 
sacroiliac joints were compared. An independent sample t-test (SPSS 16.0, SPSS, 
Chicago, III) was utilized to analyze the ADC value differences between groups. 
P < 0.05 denoted statistical significance. The mean ADC values of focal lesions 
in AS patients were also measured. Whole body diffusion weighted imaging was 
performed in additional 8 clinical confirmed AS patients and analyzed with the 
techniques of maximum intensity projection (MIP) and multiplanar reconstruction 
(MPR) in comparison with conventional MRI images to investigate the 
detectability of AS lesions with whole body DWI.
RESULTS: Mean ADC values in 16 AS patients were (0.51 ± 0.13)×10(-3)mm(2)/s in 
ilium and (0.49 ± 0.17)×10(-3)mm(2)/s in sacrum. Mean ADC values in 18 LBP 
patients were (0.32 ± 0.06)×10(-3)mm(2)/s in ilium and (0.31 ± 
0.08)×10(-3)mm(2)/s in sacrum. The ADC value in AS patients were statistically 
significantly greater than those in ilium and sacrum of LBP patients. Whole body 
DWI detected abnormalities in 8 AS patients within bilateral sacroiliac joints 
and other sites corresponding to the clinical symptoms of patients. The mean ADC 
values of focal lesions of this patient cohort were (1.31 ± 0.38)×10(-3)mm(2)/s 
in sacrum and (1.18 ± 0.27)×10(-3)mm(2)/s in ilium.
CONCLUSION: Subchondral marrow ADC values along sacroiliac joints allow the 
differentiation of patients with early AS from LBP patients. In conjunctions 
with such post-processing techniques as MIP and MPR, WB-DWI allows a 
comprehensive assessment of AS patients to guide treatment, evaluate prognosis 
and follow therapeutic responses.

Vascular malformations result from an arrest of development of a normal vascular 
structure or from abnormal growth of a vascular structure. Treatment continues 
to be a challenge. We sought to study the outcomes of sclerotherapy and 
embolization for vascular malformations. We reviewed clinical data of all 
patients treated with sclerotherapy or embolization for arteriovenous or venous 
malformations between 2006 and 2010 at Mayo Clinic. Follow-up information was 
obtained from clinical charts and a questionnaire sent to all patients. Overall, 
60 patients (24 male and 36 female; mean age 31.7 years; range, 5.6 to 72.4 
years) had 163 unique sclerotherapy or embolization procedures for lesions 
involving the lower extremity (55%), upper extremity (18.3%), pelvis (11.7%), 
abdomen (5%), chest (5%), back (3.3%), and multiple locations (1.7%). Thirty-one 
patients had low-flow venous malformations and 29 patients had high-flow 
arteriovenous malformations. Twenty-four patients required more than three 
sessions. The most common indication for intervention was pain (57 of 60 [95%]). 
Sixteen patients (27%) had documented or patient-reported complications. There 
was no significant difference in complication rates or lesion size between 
patients with low-flow or high-flow lesions. There were no procedural deaths. 
Mean available follow-up was 2.0 ± 1.3 years (range, 0.5 to 5.0 years). Median 
pain scores at most recent follow-up decreased significantly (P<.001). 
Eighty-three percent of the responders (24 of 29) would recommend treatment to 
others. With appropriate patient selection, sclerotherapy and embolization can 
decrease the pain of patients with arteriovenous and venous malformations. 
Multiple interventions might be necessary. Practitioners should be aware of the 
potential complications and counsel their patients about these risks.

Thoracolumbar junction syndrome is characterized by referred pain which may 
originate at the thoracolumbar junction, which extends from 12th thoracic 
vertebra to 2nd lumbar vertebra, due to functional abnormalities. Clinical 
manifestations include back pain, pseudo-visceral pain and pseudo-pain on the 
posterior iliac crest, as well as irritable bowel symptoms. During clinical 
examination, pain can be demonstrated by applying pressure on the facet joints 
or to the sides of the spinous processes. Radiological studies show only mild 
and insignificant degenerative changes in most cases. We report a 42-year-old 
female patient with osteogenesis imperfecta who suffered from chronic low back 
pain. Under the diagnosis of thoracolumbar junction syndrome, she was treated 
with an epidural block and a sympathetic nerve block, which improved her 
symptoms.

The symptoms and prevalence of migraine headaches are widely recognized; 
however, less is known about migraine-related spontaneous body pain, or 
migrainous corpalgia. Only a few reports have described it. The case of a 
13-year-old boy with onset of migrainous corpalgia at the age of 12 years is 
presented. He suffered from pulsatile headaches and bilateral lower back pain, 
which would appear either with the headache or as an isolated symptom. Various 
medical examinations showed no abnormalities. He was diagnosed as having 
migraine without aura and successfully treated with valproic acid. It is unique 
for this patient to have lower back pain as a symptom of migrainous corpalgia. 
It would be important for physicians to understand the variety of pain symptoms 
in migraine patients, as shown here, for better and comprehensive understanding 
of migraine and its related condition.

Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist deficient mice provide insights into 
pathogenesis of human intervertebral disc degeneration.

University, , Sheffield, UK.

OBJECTIVES: Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is potentially important in the pathogenesis of 
intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration; increasing production of matrix 
degradation enzymes and inhibiting matrix synthesis. Although IL-1 polymorphisms 
have been linked to increased risk of IVD degeneration, it is still unclear 
whether IL-1 drives IVD degeneration in vivo or is a secondary feature of 
degeneration. Here, we investigated whether IVD degeneration could be induced 
spontaneously by the removal of the natural inhibitor of IL-1 (IL-1 receptor 
antagonist) in mice that lack a functional IL-1rn gene.
METHODS: Histological staining and immunohistochemistry was performed on BALB/c 
IL-1rn(+/+) and IL-1rn(-/-) mice to examine degeneration and to localise and 
detect IL-1, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)3, MMP7, a disintigrin and MMP with 
thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)4 protein production. In addition, IVD cells were 
isolated using collagenase and proliferation potential determined.
RESULTS: IL-1rn(-/-) knockout mice displayed typical features of human disc 
degeneration: loss of proteoglycan and normal collagen structure and increased 
expression of matrix degrading enzymes: MMP3; MMP7 and ADAMTS4. Histological 
grade of degeneration increased in IL-1rn(-/-) mice which was more evident 
within older mice. In addition IVD cells isolated from IL-1rn(-/-) mice 
displayed reduced proliferation potential.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that IL-1rn(-/-) mice develop spinal abnormalities 
that resemble characteristic features associated with human disc degeneration. 
The current evidence is consistent with a role for IL-1 in the pathogenesis of 
IVD degeneration. The imbalance between IL-1 and IL-1Ra which is observed during 
human IVD degeneration could therefore be a causative factor in the degeneration 
of the IVD, and as such, is an appropriate pharmaceutical target for inhibiting 
degeneration.

Lumbosacral nerve roots anomalies may produce low back pain. These anomalies are 
reported to be a cause for failed back surgery. They are usually left 
undiagnosed, especially in endoscopic discectomy techniques. Any surgery for 
entrapment disorders, performed on a patient with undiagnosed lumbosacral nerve 
roots anomaly, may lead to serious neural injuries because of an improper 
surgical technique or decompression. In this report, we describe our experience 
with a case of L5-S1 spondylolisthesis and associated congenital lumbosacral 
nerve root anomalies discovered during the surgical intervention, and the 
difficulties raised by such a discovery. Careful examination of coronal and 
axial views obtained through high-quality Magnetic Resonance Imaging may lead to 
a proper diagnosis of this condition leading to an adequate surgical planning, 
minimizing the intraoperatory complications.

University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China.

BACKGROUND: With the advanced MRI techniques, pathologic features can be 
detected at an early stage and quantitatively evaluated, resulting in the 
advantages of early diagnosis and prompt treatment. This study aimed to 
determine the value of diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in detection of early 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and investigate the characteristic manifestations of 
AS on whole body DWI (WB-DWI).
METHODS: Twenty patients with the diagnosis of early AS, twenty patients with 
low back pain (LBP), and twenty-five healthy volunteers were included in this 
study. The subchondral bone apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) among these 
groups in the bilateral ilia and sacrum along the sacroiliac joints were 
compared. An independent sample t-test was utilized to analyze ADC value 
differences among groups. P-values less than 0.05 denoted statistical 
significance. The mean ADC values of focal DWI lesions in AS patients were also 
measured. Whole body diffusion-weighted imaging was performed in fifteen 
additional AS patients, and analyzed with MIP and MPR techniques in comparison 
to conventional MR images in order to evaluate the ability to detect AS lesions 
with whole body DWI.
RESULTS: Mean ADC values in AS patients were (0.518 ± 0.122) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in 
the ilium and (0.503 ± 0.168) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in the sacrum. These were 
significantly greater than the values measured in the ilium and sacrum of LBP 
patients, (0.328 ± 0.053) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in the ilium and (0.311 ± 0.081) × 
10(-3) m(2)/s in the sacrum, and control group, (0.325 ± 0.015) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s 
in the ilium and (0.318 ± 0.011) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in the sacrum respectively. No 
statistically significant differences were found between LBP group and control 
group. The mean ADC value of focal DWI lesions in early AS patients was (0. 899 
± 0.265) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, which was significantly higher than that of adjacent 
normal-appearance areas ((0.454 ± 0.079) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s). WB-DWI detected 
abnormalities in the 15 additional AS patients both within the sacroiliac joints 
and at other sites, corresponding to the clinical symptoms of the patients. The 
mean ADC value of focal DWI lesions of this patient cohort was (1.286 ± 0.311) × 
10(-3) mm(2)/s in the sacrum and (1.220 ± 0.299) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in the ilium.
CONCLUSIONS: Subchondral marrow ADC values of subchondral marrows near the 
sacroiliac joints allow for the differentiation of patients with early AS from 
normal volunteers and LBP patients. Combined with post-processing techniques 
such as MIP and MPR, WB-DWI allows for the comprehensive assessment of AS 
patients, an evaluation potentially helpful in determining prognosis and 
following the therapeutic response.

Introduction. Radicular low back pain is one of the most common medical 
problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI 
and electrodiagnosis in lower extremity radicular pain in relation to history 
and clinical findings. Methods. In this cross-sectional study, we studied 165 
sciatalgic subjects. A comprehensive history and physical examinations were 
taken from the subjects and recorded, and then MRI scanning and 
electrodiagnostic (nerve conduction velocity and electromyography) tests were 
performed. Results. From 152 subjects who remained in the study, 67 cases 
(44.1%) had radicular pain in left lower limb, 46 (30.3%) in right, and 39 
(25.6%) in both lower limbs. 104 cases (68.4%) had shown some type of 
abnormalities in both MRI and electrodiagnosis, 30 (19.7%) had shown this 
abnormality only in MRI, and 21 (13.8%) only in electrodiagnosis, while 10 cases 
(6.5%) had both normal MRI and electrodiagnostic studies. Coordination rates of 
MRI and electrodiagnosis with clinical findings were 58.6% and 89.5%, 
respectively. Conclusion. In many MRI negative but symptomatic subjects, 
electrodiagnosis has an important diagnostic value.

Congenital malformations such as lumbosacral transitional vertebrae and spina 
bifida occulta constitute unrare anomalies and could affect the symptomatology 
of low back pain. A transitional vertebra is characterized by elongation of one 
or both transverse processes, leading to the appearance ofa sacralized fifth 
lumbar vertebra or a lumbarized first sacral vertebra. Furthermore, sacral spina 
bifida occulta is a developmental anomaly that corresponds to the incomplete 
closure of the vertebral column. In the present case report, we describe a case 
of a dried sacrum presenting a partially sacralized fifth lumbar vertebra and 
total spina bifida, extended from first to fifth sacral vertebra. A 
pseudoarthrosis is formed on the left side and the specimen could be 
incorporated in Castellvi's type IIa. Moreover, the incidence, morphology, 
clinical and surgical significance of these spinal malformations are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Low backache (LBA) is one of the most common problems and 
herniated lumbar disc is one of the most commonly diagnosed abnormalities 
associated with LBA. Disc herniation of the same size may be asymptomatic in one 
patient and can lead to severe nerve root compromise in another patient.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate correlation between the clinical features of disc 
collapse and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding to determine the clinical 
importance of anatomical abnormalities identified by MRI technique.
SUMMARY: From January 2010 to January 2012, 75 otherwise healthy patients (43 
males 32 females) between the age of 19 and 55 years (average age was 44.5 
years) with low back pain and predominant complaint of root pain who presented 
to our clinic were included in the study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proper screening was done to rule out previous spine 
affection and subjected to MRI.
RESULTS: The results were analyzed under four headings viz. disc herniation, 
disc degeneration, thecal sac deformation and neural foramen effacement. All 
patients had a visual analog score (VAS) score more than 6. The interrater 
correlation coefficient kappa was calculated to be k=0.51. There were total 44 
patients with herniation, 25 patients had mild, one patient had moderate degree 
of thecal sac deformation, 21 patients had one or more levels of foraminal 
effacement by the herniated tissue, 100% of the patients had disc degeneration 
ranging from grade 1 to 3 at different levels; and 48 patients (64%) had 
radiculopathy, six (8%) patients had bilateral and others had ipsilateral 
affection.
CONCLUSION: In our study, the correlation was made between clinical findings and 
MRI findings. It can safely be concluded that treating physician should put more 
emphasis on history, clinical examination, and make the inference by these and 
then should correlate the clinical findings with that of MRI to reach a final 
diagnosis.

Gregory JF, Beute TC.

Erythema ab igne is a reticulated, erythematous, hyperpigmented dermatosis 
resulting from chronic mild to moderate heat exposure. The authors present two 
cases of erythema ab igne, one from a hot water bottle to treat chronic low back 
pain and another from a heated automobile seat. They review other reported 
etiologies and highlight scenarios in which military medical providers may 
encounter erythema ab igne.

How long and low can you go? Effect of conformation on the risk of thoracolumbar 
intervertebral disc extrusion in domestic dogs.

Intervertebral disc extrusion (IVDE) is a common neurological disorder in 
certain dog breeds, resulting in spinal cord compression and injury that can 
cause pain and neurological deficits. Most disc extrusions are reported in 
chondrodystrophic breeds (e.g. Dachshunds, Basset Hounds, Pekingese), where 
selection for 'long and low' morphologies is linked with intervertebral discs 
abnormalities that predispose dogs to IVDE. The aim of this study was to 
quantify the relationship between relative thoracolumbar vertebral column length 
and IVDE risk in diverse breeds. A 14 month cross-sectional study of dogs 
entering a UK small animal referral hospital for diverse disorders including 
IVDE was carried out. Dogs were measured on breed-defining morphometrics, 
including back length (BL) and height at the withers (HW). Of 700 dogs recruited 
from this referral population, measured and clinically examined, 79 were 
diagnosed with thoracolumbar IVDE following diagnostic imaging ± surgery. The 
BL:HW ratio was positively associated with IVDE risk, indicating that relatively 
longer dogs were at increased risk, e.g. the probability of IVDE was 0.30 for 
Miniature Dachshunds when BL:HW ratio equalled 1.1, compared to 0.68 when BL:HW 
ratio equalled 1.5. Additionally, both being overweight and skeletally smaller 
significantly increased IVDE risk. Therefore, selection for longer backs and 
miniaturisation should be discouraged in high-risk breeds to reduce IVDE risk. 
In higher risk individuals, maintaining a lean body shape is particularly 
important to reduce the risk of IVDE. Results are reported as probabilities to 
aid decision-making regarding breed standards and screening programmes 
reflecting the degree of risk acceptable to stakeholders.

[An adult Guillain-Barré syndrome patient with enhancement of anterior roots on 
spinal MRI and severe radicular pain relieved by intravenous methylprednisolone 
pulse therapy: A case report].

[Article in Japanese]

A 37-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of progressive abnormal 
gait and severe pain in the low back and lower extremities, more severe on the 
right side, especially in his right posterior thigh. The pain appeared one week 
after he suffered from slight fever and diarrhea. On admission, a neurological 
examination revealed mild distal weakness of the all extremities and loss of 
Achilles tendon reflex, associated with positive Lasègue sign. However, 
sensation was intact except for slightly impaired vibratory sensation on the 
trunk. An electrophysiological study showed diminished amplitude of compound 
muscle action potential and loss of F-wave of the posterior tibial nerves. 
Finding of cerebrospinal fluid was normal at the time of admission, although 12 
days later albuminocytologic dissociation was found. Cervical and lumbar 
magnetic resonance images showed gadolinium enhancement of the anterior nerve 
roots and the cauda equina, more prominent on the right side, correlating with 
the prominent side of the patient's leg pain. Because of neurological features, 
electrophysiological abnormalities and CSF findings, we diagnosed his illness as 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) characterized by severe back and leg pain. The 
character of pain was deep and aching, suggesting myalgic pain caused by the 
affected anterior roots. A short course high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIg) therapy was not effective against the radicular pain although minimal 
improvement of limb weakness occurred. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 
carbamazepine were unsuccessful for pain relief. Thereafter, intravenous 
methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse therapy was introduced. On the day IVMP pulse 
therapy started, severe radicular pain began to decrease and became gradually 
milder without any marked effect on the other symptoms and signs of GBS.Moderate 
to severe pain is a common and early symptom of GBS and requires aggressive 
treatment. IVMP pulse therapy may be one of treatments for refractory and 
intolerable pain of GBS.

A 71-year-old patient reported pain in the left hip 14 months after treatment 
with radiotherapy for a ypT3N1M0 rectal carcinoma, and a 61-year-old patient 
reported pain in the lower back with radiation to the buttocks 8 months after 
radiotherapy for a ypT3N2M0 rectal carcinoma. In both patients the initial 
diagnosis considered was bone metastasis. After MRI and nuclear bone scans, 
however, diagnoses of insufficiency fractures of the acetabulum and sacroiliac 
(SI) joints, respectively, were made. Insufficiency fractures of the SI joints 
or acetabula are a frequent complication of radiotherapy and should be 
considered in all oncology patients who present with sudden onset of back pain 
or lower back pain after radiotherapy. A MRI scan is the initial investigation 
of choice. Treatment is conservative, with analgesia and physiotherapy. 
Prognosis is good; symptoms disappear within 1 year in almost all patients.

Sacral fatigue fractures represent a frequently overlooked cause of low-back and 
buttock pain in athletes. A high index of clinical suspicion and MRI utilization 
can provide the accurate diagnosis. A 38-year-old male amateur, midfielder, 
soccer player presented to our department with aggravating right buttock pain 
during the previous month, following an increase in training intensity and 
frequency on an artificial turf field. A point of maximal tenderness was 
demonstrated over the area of the right sacroiliac joint. No radiographic 
abnormalities were observed. MRI of the pelvis revealed the presence of a stress 
fracture in the right sacral ala. The patient underwent conservative treatment 
and resumed playing soccer 12 weeks later, with no residual or recurrent 
clinical complaints. Apart from the recent change in training regimen, decreased 
shock absorption related to the physical properties of old generation artificial 
turf may have also been involved in this case.

Objective. When exploring the scientific basis of reflexology techniques, 
elucidation of the surface and subsurface features of reflexology areas (RAs) is 
crucial. In this study, the subcutaneous features of RAs related to the lumbar 
vertebrae were evaluated by swept source-optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) 
in subjects with and without low back pain (LBP). Methods. Volunteers without 
LBP (n = 6 (male : female = 1 : 1)) and subjects with LBP (n = 15 (male : female 
= 2 : 3)) were clinically examined in terms of skin colour (visual perception), 
localised tenderness (visual analogue scale) and structural as well as optical 
attributes as per SS-OCT. From each subject, 6 optical tomograms were recorded 
from equidistant transverse planes along the longitudinal axis of the RAs, and 
from each tomogram, 25 different spatial locations were considered for recording 
SS-OCT image attributes. The images were analysed with respect to the optical 
intensity distributions and thicknesses of different skin layers by using 
AxioVision Rel. 4.8.2 software. The SS-OCT images could be categorised into 4 
pathological grades (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3) according to distinctness in the 
visible skin layers. Results. Three specific grades for abnormalities in SS-OCT 
images were identified considering gradual loss of distinctness and increase in 
luminosity of skin layers. Almost 90.05% subjects were of mixed type having 
predominance in certain grades. Conclusion. The skin SS-OCT system demonstrated 
a definite association of the surface features of healthy/unhealthy RAs with 
cutaneous features and the clinical status of the lumbar vertebrae.

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) was shown to be associated with pathophysiological 
changes at several levels of the sensorimotor system. Changes in sensory 
thresholds have been reported but complete profiles of Quantitative Sensory 
Testing (QST) were only rarely obtained in CLBP patients. The aim of the present 
study was to investigate comprehensive QST profiles in CLBP at the painful site 
(back) and at a site distinct from their painful region (hand) and to compare 
these data with similar data in healthy controls. We found increased detection 
thresholds in CLBP patients compared to healthy controls for all innocuous 
stimuli at the back and extraterritorial to the painful region at the hand. 
Additionally, CLBP patients showed decreased pain thresholds at both sites. 
Importantly, there was no interaction between the investigated site and group, 
i.e. thresholds were changed both at the affected body site and for the site 
distinct from the painful region (hand). Our results demonstrate severe, 
widespread changes in somatosensory sensitivity in CLBP patients. These

INTRODUCTION: HLA-B27 has a modifier effect on the phenotype of multiple 
diseases, both associated and non-associated with it. Among these effects, an 
increased frequency of clinical enthesitis in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis 
(RA) has been reported but never explored again. We aimed to replicate this 
study with a sensitive and quantitative assessment of enthesitis by using 
standardized ultrasonography (US).
METHODS: The Madrid Sonography Enthesitis Index (MASEI) was applied to the US 
assessment of 41 HLA-B27 positive and 41 matched HLA-B27 negative patients with 
longstanding RA. Clinical characteristics including explorations aimed to 
evaluate spondyloarthrtitis and laboratory tests were also done.
RESULTS: A significant degree of abnormalities in the entheses of the patients 
with RA were found, but the MASEI values, and each of its components including 
the Doppler signal, were similar in HLA-B27 positive and negative patients. An 
increase of the MASEI scores with age was identified. Differences in two 
clinical features were found: a lower prevalence of rheumatoid factor and a more 
common story of low back pain in the HLA-B27 positive patients than in the 
negative. The latter was accompanied by radiographic sacroiliitis in two HLA-B27 
positive patients. No other differences were detected.
CONCLUSION: We have found that HLA-B27 positive patients with RA do not have 
more enthesitis as assessed with US than the patients lacking this HLA allele. 
However, HLA-B27 could be shaping the RA phenotype towards RF seronegativity and 
axial involvement.

A 23-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with lumbago about two weeks 
previously, and headache six days previously. Brain MR imaging revealed no 
remarkable findings except for left ethmoid sinusitis; both MR angiography and 
venography showed no vascular abnormalities. On the day after admission, lumbar 
puncture was performed because right homonymous hemianopsia and nuchal stiffness 
developed. The cerebrospinal fluid appeared bloody, and the source of bleeding 
was searched for. MR images of the lumbar spine demonstrated an intradural tumor 
with heterogenous contrast enhancement, and this tumor was considered to be the 
source of the bleeding. Tumor resection was performed, but some parts of the 
tumor could not be resected because of adhesion to the cauda equina. The 
pathological findings of the tumor demonstrated myxopapillary ependymoma. 
Radiation therapy was added to treat the residual tumor because myxopapillary 
ependymoma tended to recur in spite of the benign nature of the tumor. Spinal 
myxopapillary ependymoma is rare, but it causes subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage from spinal tumor should be suspected when headache 
accompanied with severe low back pain are present even in the absence of spinal 
signs.

Vertebral column is a common site for bony metastases in patients with systemic 
malignancy. Patients with metastatic spinal tumors usually present with pain. 
Some tumors are asymptomatic and can be detected during screening examinations. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the vertebral column with the panel of 
available imagining methods and the clinical findings should be used for the 
diagnosis of spinal metastasis. A 45-year-old man was admitted with low back 
pain. With a history of rectum surgery and radiotherapy, he was on chemotherapy 
for rectum adenocarcinoma. F18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography scan 
which was performed three weeks ago showed no abnormalities other than the 
primary surgical site. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar vertebrae spine 
revealed a lesion on the tip of L4 spinous process. Excisional biopsy of L4 
spinous process was performed. Histologic examination revealed mucinous 
adenocarcinoma. He had no low back pain at two-months follow-up. We could not 
find any solitary spinous process metastasis reported in English literature. 
Patients with nonspecific spinal pain with a previous cancer history should be 
carefully evaluated for a spinal metastasis. Even a solitary spinous process 
lesion may turn out to be the initial manifestation of a spinal metastasis.

School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.

A 14-year-old boy presented with a rare case of congenital absence of lumbar 
facet joint manifesting as low back pain. Physical examination showed no 
neurological or hematologic abnormalities. Radiography revealed absence of a 
facet joint on the right side of L4-5. Computed tomography and three-dimensional 
computed tomography revealed absence of the facet joint on the right side of 
L4-5 and spondylolysis on both sides of L5. Pain subsided after conservative 
treatment. This is an extremely rare case of congenital absence of lumbar facet 
joint associated with bilateral spondylolysis.

Preliminary evidence that low ankle-brachial index is associated with reduced 
bilateral hip extensor strength and functional mobility in peripheral arterial 
disease.

OBJECTIVE: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has been associated with skeletal 
muscle pathology, including atrophy of the affected muscles. In addition, 
oxidative metabolism is impaired, muscle function is reduced, and gait and 
mobility are restricted. We hypothesized that greater severity of symptomatic 
PAD would be associated with lower levels of muscle mass, strength, and 
endurance, and that these musculoskeletal abnormalities in turn would impair 
functional performance and walking ability in patients with PAD.
METHODS: We assessed 22 persons with intermittent claudication from PAD in this 
cross-sectional pilot study. Outcome assessments included initial claudication 
distance and absolute claudication distance via treadmill protocols and outcomes 
from the 6-minute walk (6MW). Secondary outcomes included one repetition maximum 
strength/endurance testing of hip extensors, hip abductors, quadriceps, 
hamstrings, plantar flexors, pectoral, and upper back muscle groups, as well as 
performance-based tests of function. Univariate and stepwise multiple regression 
models were constructed to evaluate relationships and are presented.
RESULTS: Twenty-two participants (63.6% male; mean [standard deviation] age, 
73.6 [8.2] years; range, 55-85 years) were studied. Mean (standard deviation) 
resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.54 ([0.13]; range, 0.28-0.82), and 
participants ranged from having mild claudication to rest pain. Lower resting 
ABI was significantly associated with reduced bilateral hip extensor strength (r 
= 0.54; P = .007) and reduced whole body strength (r = 0.32; P = .05). In 
addition, lower ABI was associated with a shorter distance to first stop during 
the 6MW (r = 0.38; P = .05) and poorer single leg balance (r = 0.44; P = .03). 
Reduced bilateral hip extensor strength was also significantly associated with 
functional outcomes, including reduced 6MW distance to first stop (r = 0.74; P = 
.001), reduced 6MW distance (r = 0.75; P < .001), and reduced total short 
physical performance battery score (worse function; r = 0.75; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a causal pathway from a 
reduction in ABI to muscle atrophy and weakness, to whole body disability 
represented by claudication outcomes and performance-based tests of functional 
mobility in an older cohort with symptomatic PAD. Longitudinal outcomes from 
this study and future trials are required to investigate the effects of an 
anabolic intervention targeting the muscles involved in mobility and activities 
of daily living and whether an increase in muscle strength will improve symptoms 
of claudication and lead to improvements in other functional outcomes in 
patients with PAD.

Assessment of effectiveness of percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing chronic low 
back pain secondary to lumbar central spinal canal stenosis.

Author information:
(1)Pain Management Center of Paducah, Paducah, Kentucky, USA.

BACKGROUND: Chronic persistent low back and lower extremity pain secondary to 
central spinal stenosis is common and disabling. Lumbar surgical interventions 
with decompression or fusion are most commonly performed to manage severe spinal 
stenosis. However, epidural injections are also frequently performed in managing 
central spinal stenosis. After failure of epidural steroid injections, the next 
sequential step is percutaneous adhesiolysis and hypertonic saline neurolysis 
with a targeted delivery. The literature on the effectiveness of percutaneous 
adhesiolysis in managing central spinal stenosis after failure of epidural 
injections has not been widely studied.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective evaluation.
SETTING: An interventional pain management practice, a specialty referral 
center, a private practice setting in the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis 
in patients with chronic low back and lower extremity pain with lumbar central 
spinal stenosis.
METHODS: Seventy patients were recruited. The initial phase of the study was 
randomized, double-blind with a comparison of percutaneous adhesiolysis with 
caudal epidural injections. The 25 patients from the adhesiolysis group 
continued with follow-up, along with 45 additional patients, leading to a total 
of 70 patients. All patients received percutaneous adhesiolysis and appropriate 
placement of the Racz catheter, followed by an injection of 5 mL of 2% 
preservative-free lidocaine with subsequent monitoring in the recovery room. In 
the recovery room, each patient also received 6 mL of 10% hypertonic sodium 
chloride solution, and 6 mg of non-particulate betamethasone, followed by an 
injection of 1 mL of sodium chloride solution and removal of the catheter.
OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT: Multiple outcome measures were utilized including the 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment 
status, and opioid intake with assessment at 3, 6, and 12, 18 and 24 months post 
treatment. The primary outcome measure was 50% or more improvement in pain 
scores and ODI scores.
RESULTS: Overall, a primary outcome or significant pain relief and functional 
status improvement of 50% or more was seen in 71% of patients at the end of 2 
years. The overall number of procedures over a period of 2 years were 5.7 ± 
2.73.
LIMITATIONS: The lack of a control group and a prospective design.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant relief and functional status improvement as seen in 71% 
of the 70 patients with percutaneous adhesiolysis utilizing local anesthetic 
steroids and hypertonic sodium chloride solution may be an effective management 
strategy in patients with chronic function limiting low back and lower extremity 
pain with central spinal stenosis after failure of conservatie management and 
fluoroscopically directed epidural injections.

(1)Chiropractor, Private Practice, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to report the chiropractic management of 
a patient with low back pain and Castellvi type II lumbosacral transitional 
vertebrae (LSTV).
CLINICAL FEATURES: A patient with previously undiagnosed LSTV presented with 
moderate low back pain.
INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: Manual therapy, soft tissue therapy, and 
exercise/stretching were included in the initial treatment plan. Following a 
short course of treatment, the presenting symptoms resolved; however, they 
returned after 3 symptom-free months. At that time, radiographs were ordered and 
the LSTV were identified. Following another course of chiropractic care, the 
patient's symptoms resolved.
CONCLUSIONS: Chiropractic management resulted in resolution of symptoms for this 
patient with LSTV.

(1)Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Safat, 
Kuwait.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study.
PURPOSE: To Investigate the prevalence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
changes of the lumbar spine in low back pain (LBP) and the associated risk 
factors in young Arab population.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Studies on the prevalence of MRI findings and their 
relationship with LBP have been conducted; these have occurred in adult 
populations in developed countries. The prevalence of MRI changes in the young 
Arab population with LBP is not known.
METHODS: Two hundred and fourteen patients of Arab origin in the 16 to 29 year 
age group with LBP symptoms underwent MRI examinations. The prevalence of MRI 
changes in the lumbar spine and associated risk factors were determined and 
compared to age, race, and gender-matched controls.
RESULTS: A majority (64%) of the patients with LBP (138 out of 214) were found 
to have MRI evidence of degenerative disc disease (DD) compared to 10% (22 out 
of 214) in the control group. The majority (61%) of patients had multiple level 
disease, most commonly involving the lowest 2 disc levels. Reduced signal of the 
disc followed by disc bulge was the most common MRI features seen in the 
symptomatic subjects. Obesity correlated with MRI prevalence of abnormalities, 
while activity demonstrated a positive trend.
CONCLUSIONS: The MRI prevalence of DD among the young Arab patients with LBP is 
high when compared to other reports in literature. Obesity correlated with MRI 
prevalence of abnormalities while activity demonstrated a positive trend.

A 91-year-old man with chronic low-back pain presented with 1-day history of 
disturbance of consciousness and myoclonus of all of his extremities and face. 
Laboratory examinations revealed no abnormalities. Administration of 
benzodiazepine for the myoclonus resulted in immediate and complete 
disappearance of the symptoms. He recently started taking pregabalin (Lyrica 
capsules) which was prescribed for low-back pain 3 days ago. The day following 
admission, he discontinued pregabalin. He did not experience recurrence of his 
symptoms any more. We concluded that the neurological symptoms he experienced 
were possibly due to pregabalin.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers' views of chronic low 
back pain patients' expectations of CAM therapies: a qualitative study.

1730 Minor Avenue, Suite 1600, Seattle, WA 98101, USA.

BACKGROUND: Some researchers think that patients with higher expectations for 
CAM therapies experience better outcomes and that enthusiastic providers can 
enhance treatment outcomes. This is in contrast to evidence suggesting 
conventional medical providers often reorient patient expectations to better 
match what providers believe to be realistic. However, there is a paucity of 
research on CAM providers' views of their patients' expectations regarding CAM 
therapy and the role of these expectations in patient outcomes.
METHODS: To better understand how CAM providers view and respond to their 
patients' expectations of a particular therapy, we conducted 32 semi-structured, 
qualitative interviews with acupuncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists 
and yoga instructors identified through convenience sampling. Interviews were 
recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically using Atlas ti version 6.1.
RESULTS: CAM providers reported that they attempt to ensure that their patients' 
expectations are realistic. Providers indicated they manage their patients' 
expectations in a number of domains- roles and responsibilities of providers and 
patients, treatment outcomes, timeframe for improvement, and treatment 
experience. Providers reported that patients' expectations change over time and 
that they need to continually manage these expectations to enhance patient 
engagement and satisfaction with treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Providers of four types of CAM therapies viewed patients' 
expectations as an important component of their experiences with CAM therapy and 
indicated that they try to align patient expectations with reality. These 
findings suggest that CAM providers are similar in this respect to conventional 
medical providers.

Kinematic asymmetries of the lower limbs during ergometer rowing.

e.buckeridge09@imperial.ac.uk

PURPOSE: Rowing injuries, particularly of the lumbar spine, are often attributed 
to poor technique. Rowing technique comprises a series of coordinated movements 
between the back, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and abnormalities in these may 
lead to injury. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that ergometer 
rowing is symmetrical with respect to lower limb motion and that deviations from 
symmetry result from rowing experience, work rate, or stroke position.
METHODS: Twenty-two rowers in three levels of ability participated in this 
study. A motion analysis system was used with an instrumented rowing ergometer, 
which incorporated load cells at the handle and seat. Kinematic measurements of 
the knees, hips, lumbar-pelvic joints, and pelvic twist, in addition to measures 
of handle force, seat force, stroke length, mediolateral seat drift, and mean 
external power, were made during an incremental step test.
RESULTS: Elite rowers exhibited the largest handle force and mean external power 
(P < 0.01) and least mediolateral seat drift (P < 0.01). All groups demonstrated 
lower limb asymmetries, with hip asymmetries significantly greater than knee 
asymmetries (P < 0.01). Regression analysis indicated that both hip and knee 
range of motion (ROM) asymmetry was significant (P < 0.05) in predicting 
lumbar-pelvic flexion at the catch and maximum handle force of the stroke. 
However, hip ROM asymmetry showed a better relation with lumbar-pelvic flexion 
compared with knee ROM asymmetry, explaining a greater proportion of the 
variance.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral asymmetries during the rowing stroke, particularly at the 
hips, can contribute to suboptimal kinematics of the lumbar-pelvic region. 
Quantification of hip ROM asymmetries may therefore be a useful tool in 
predicting the development of low back pain in rowers.

Low back complaints worse, but not more frequent in subjects with congenital 
lumbosacral malformations: a study on 5000 recruits.

The authors studied the plain radiographs and medical records of 5000 military 
recruits, mean age 19.1 years (range: 18 to 22), screened in a Turkish Military 
Hospital in the period November 2008-October 2009. They focused on the incidence 
of congenital lumbosacral malformations, such as spina bifida occulta and 
transitional vertebra, trying to find a correlation with subsequent low back 
complaints. Only 80 out of 748 subjects (10.7%) with low back complaints had one 
or more malformations, versus 744 out of 4252 subjects (17.5%) without low back 
complaints. This pleaded against a correlation between malformations and low 
back disorders. Also the literature is completely divided as to this problem, 
which means that there is probably no correlation at all. Interestingly, the 80 
subjects with low back complaints and malformation estimated their pain level at 
+/- 4.6 on a Visual Analog Scale for pain, while the 668 with low back 
complaints but without malformation estimated their pain level at only +/- 2.2 
(p = 0.007). At least two other studies led to the same conclusion. This paradox 
might be due to the fact that congenital malformations concentrate all external 
stress on the adjacent levels.

Comparison of the symptoms of menopause and symptoms of thyroid disease in 
Japanese women aged 35-59 years.

Oi N(1), Ohi K.

Author information:
(1)* Department of Gender-specific Medicine , Tokyo Women's Medical University 
East Medical Center.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we surveyed thyroid function abnormalities and 
menopausal symptoms in young as well as in menopausal women.
METHODS: We conducted a random survey among outpatients at our facility from 
September 2008 to June 2011. The study included 853 women aged 35-59 years. We 
assessed the subjects according to the Simplified Menopause Index, menstrual 
status, thyroid hormone measurements (thyroid stimulating hormone, free 
thyroxine, free triiodothyronine), the presence of Hashimoto's disease 
antibodies (anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody or anti-thyroglobulin antibody), 
the presence of Grave's disease (anti-TSH receptor antibody), markers of thyroid 
tumor (high thyroglobulin), and thyroid ultrasonography studies. The data were 
analyzed by means of the statistical program JMP version 8.0.
RESULTS: 'Facial flushing', 'sweating', and 'thyroid tumor' were all positively 
related with age and menstrual status. 'Breathlessness and palpitations' were 
positively related to Grave's disease. Moreover, 'sweating', 'irritability', and 
'stiff shoulders, low back pain, and joint pain' were related to thyroid tumors. 
'Insomnia' decreased with age. Patients with Hashimoto's disease were very rare 
because they were usually treated at other hospitals that specialize in thyroid 
disease.
CONCLUSION: The symptoms of thyroid function abnormalities were shown to be very 
similar to menopausal symptoms and were found to occur in younger women before 
the onset of menopause. This study shows the need to differentiate menopausal 
symptoms from those of thyroid diseases.

Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. koyama@tau.ac.jp

Several studies have shown a higher prevalence of radiological abnormalities 
among gymnasts. However, the types of radiological abnormalities associated with 
low back pain (LBP) have not been clarified. The hypothesis was that significant 
relationships between radiological abnormalities and LBP may be revealed by 
discriminating between the types of MRI abnormalities while considering 
confounding factors. The subjects were 104 Japanese collegiate gymnasts (men, 
70; women, 34). The presence of LBP was evaluated using the questionnaire 
developed by Osaka City University (OCU Test). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
abnormalities were evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted MRI. The prevalence of 
more than 1 MRI abnormality in gymnasts was 47.1% (49/104). The chi-square test 
showed that the incidence of lumbar disc degeneration (LDDG) and limbus vertebra 
was significantly greater in gymnasts with LBP than in gymnasts without LBP. By 
using logistic regression analysis to analyze the concomitant environmental 
variables, only LDDG (odds ratio, 2.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-6.66) was 
selected as a statistically significant variable accounting for LBP. In

PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and degree of lumbosacral transitional 
vertebrae (LSTV) in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) cohort, to assess 
whether LSTV correlates with low back pain (LBP) and buttock pain, and to assess 
the reproducibility of grading LSTV.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained, and 
informed consent documentation was approved for the study protocol. Standard 
standing pelvic radiographs that included the transverse processes of L5 were 
graded according to Castellvi classification of LSTV in 4636 participants (1992 
men and 2804 women; aged 45-80 years) from the OAI cohort. These data were 
correlated with prevalence and severity of LBP and buttock pain.
RESULTS: Prevalence of LSTV was 18.1% (841 of 4636), with a higher rate in men 
than in women (28.1% vs 11.1%, respectively; P<.001). Of the 841 individuals 
with LSTV, 41.72% were type I (dysplastic enlarged transverse process), 41.4% 
were type II (pseudoarticulation), 11.5% were type III (fusion), and 5.2% were 
type IV (one transverse process fused and one with pseudoarticulation). Of the 
participants without LSTV, 53.9% reported LBP, while the prevalence of LBP for 
types I, II, III, and IV was 46%, 73%, 40%, and 66%, respectively (P<.05, χ2 
test). Types II and IV had higher prevalence and severity of LBP and buttock 
pain (P<.001).
CONCLUSION: LSTV types II and IV positively correlate with prevalence and 
severity of LBP and buttock pain.

OBJECTIVES: to compare clinical, biochemical and radiological manifestations of 
severe vitamin D deficiency (VDD - serum 25 OH - vitamin D level <10 ng/ml) in 
adolescents and children and to investigate the effects of an intramuscular 
injection (IM) of vitamin D3 megadose.
DESIGN: in this prospective study 36 adolescents and 45 children with severe VDD 
were studied. An IM dose (10,000 IU/kg, max 600,000 IU) of cholecalciferol was 
injected and parameters of calcium homeostasis were measured at intervals of 3 
months.
RESULTS: at presentation, infants and young children (age 1.9 ± 0.5 years) with 
severe VDD had enlarged wrist joints (42/45), cranial bossing (39/45), wide 
anterior fontanel (27/45), Harrison's sulcus (11/45) , chest rosaries (27/45), 
bow legs (29/45), delayed teething (40/45), delayed motor milestones (36/45), 
short stature (length/height SDS <-2)(12/45), craniotabes (4/45) and 
hypocalcemic tetany ( 11/45). The most frequent biochemical abnormality was high 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (45/45), followed by low phosphate (PO4) (36/45) and 
low calcium (Ca) (8/45). Adolescents with severe VDD presented with pain in 
weight bearing joints, back, thighs, knees, and calves (30/36) difficulty 
walking and/or climbing stairs and/or running (8/36), muscle cramps and/or 
facial twitches and/or carpopedal spasms (2/36) and genu valgum (2/36). 
Biochemical serum abnormalities included high ALP (31/36), low phosphate (10/36) 
and low Ca (4/36). Variable radiological manifestations due to VDD were detected 
in all children (45/45) and in some of adolescents (19/35). Two different 
radiological patterns have been recognized in adolescents. Three months after 
injecting a mega dose of cholecalciferol all biochemical abnormalities were 
corrected with significant improvement of symptoms related to VDD had been 
reported in all children (45/45) and in the majority (33/36) of adolescents with 
VDD. 3-6 months after the injection, complete healing of the radiological 
evidence of VDD was achieved in all rachitic children and the majority of 
adolescents (16/19).
CONCLUSION: it appears that adolescents adapt better to severe VDD compared to 
infants, with less severe clinical, biochemical and radiological manifestations. 
An IM mega dose of cholecalciferol is effective therapy for treatment of VDD in 
children and adolescents for 3 months but not for 6 months.;

INTRODUCTION: The relation between radiological abnormalities on lumbar spine 
and low back pain (LBP) has been debated, presumably because of potential biases 
related to heterogeneity in selection of the subjects, radiological 
abnormalities at entry, or its cross-sectional observation in nature. Therefore, 
the aim of this study of a selected population of asymptomatic Japanese Self 
Defense Forces (JSDF) young adults male with normal lumbar radiographs was to 
investigate the incidence of newly developed lumbar degenerative changes at 
middle age and to study their association to LBP.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 1990, 84 JSDF male military servicemen aged 18 years, 
without a history of LBP and radiological abnormal findings, were enrolled. 
After 20 years, 84 subjects were underwent repeated X-ray and completed 
questionnaires on current LBP and lifestyle factors.
RESULTS: The prevalence of LBP was demonstrated 59 %, with 85 % of them showing 
mild pain. Analysis of lumbar radiographs revealed that 48 % had normal findings 
and 52 % had degenerative changes. The association between LBP and life style 
factors was not demonstrated. Lumbar spine in subjects with LBP was more 
degenerated than in those without. Although disc space narrowing and LBP did not 
achieve a statistical significance, a significant correlation existed between 
vertebral osteophyte and LBP in univariate and multivariate analysis (OR 3.0; 95 
% CI 1.227-7.333).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study demonstrated the significant 
association between vertebral osteophyte and incidence of mild LBP in initially 
asymptomatic and radiologically normal subjects. These data provide the 
additional information concerning the pathology of LBP, but further study is 
needed to clarify the clinical relevance.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the site of axial pain (thoracic spine, lumbar 
spine or buttock(s)) was associated with the site of MRI lesions in patients 
with recent inflammatory back pain (IBP) suggesting spondyloarthritis.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of baseline data in 708 patients 
with recent IBP from the DESIR cohort. Radiographs of the sacroiliac joints 
(SIJs) and MRI scans of the SIJs and thoracic and lumbar spine were obtained 
routinely. Associations between pain sites and sites of inflammatory and 
structural MRI changes were evaluated using separate multivariate logistic 
regressions.
RESULTS: Of the 648 patients with complete data, 61% had thoracic pain, 91.6% 
lumbar pain and 79.2% buttock pain. MRI inflammation was seen in 19%, 21% and 
46% of patients at the thoracic, lumbar and SIJ sites, respectively. By 
multivariate analysis, pain was significantly associated with MRI inflammation 
only at the same site (adjusted OR (aOR)thoracic pain 1.71; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.67; 
p=0.02; aORlumbar pain 2.53; 95% CI 1.03 to 6.20; p=0.04; aORbuttock pain 2.86; 
95% CI 1.84 to 4.46; p<0.0001). Pain site was not significantly associated with 
the site of structural MRI changes, except for buttock pain and SIJ structural 
MRI changes (aORbuttock pain 1.89; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.90; p=0.004). The 
association between pain site and site of MRI inflammation persisted in the 
subgroups with normal or doubtful SIJ radiographs or with Assessment of 
SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for axial spondyloarthritis.
CONCLUSIONS: The site of pain (thoracic spine, lumbar spine or buttock(s)) is 
associated with MRI inflammation at the same site in patients with recent IBP.

Kasugai, Aichi, Japan.

We report 2 cases of congenital pericardial defect with ruptured acute type A 
aortic dissection. Case 1: An 83-year old man presented with sudden chest and 
back pain, and computed tomography (CT) showed acute aortic dissection with left 
pleural massive effusion. Because of his unstable haemodynamic condition with 
low blood pressure, an emergency operation was performed. We observed small 
amounts of bloody pericardial effusion, massive left-sided bloody pleural 
effusion and a partial left-sided pericardial defect of the pulmonary artery. 
The ascending aorta was replaced. The postoperative course was uneventful. Case 
2: A 79-year old man presented with fainting followed by cardiac arrest and was 
resuscitated. Chest CT showed acute aortic dissection and massive haemothorax. 
Emergency operation was attempted, but was given up. We observed partial 
left-sided pericardial defect of the pulmonary artery. Further, we reviewed 6 
cases of congenital pericardial defect with ruptured acute aortic dissection, 
including our 2 cases. In all the cases, the patients did not develop cardiac 
tamponade but had massive haemothorax due to congenital pericardial defects 
leading to confusion in diagnoses and surgical strategies. Therefore, it may be 
necessary to consider congenital pericardial defects before performing an 
operation in case of acute type A aortic dissection with massive haemothorax.

and Research, Chandigarh, India.

INTRODUCTION: Abnormal morphologic findings in imaging were thought to explain 
the etiology of low back pain (LBP). However, it is now known that variety of 
morphologic abnormalities is noted even in asymptomatic individuals. Single 
photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) could be used 
to differentiate incidental findings from clinically significant findings.
OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to define the SPECT/CT patterns in patients 
with LBP and to correlate these with clinical and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty adult patients with LBP of duration 3 months or 
more were prospectively evaluated in this study. Patients with known or 
suspected malignancy, trauma or infectious processes were excluded. A detailed 
history of sensory and motor symptoms and neurologic examination was performed. 
All the patients were subjected to MRI and bone scintigraphy with hybrid 
SPECT/CT of the lumbo-sacral spine within 1 month of each other. The patients 
were classified into those with and without neurologic symptoms, activity 
limitation. The findings of clinical examination and imaging were compared. MRI 
and SPECT/CT findings were also compared.
RESULTS: Thirty patients (18 men and 12 women; mean age 38 years; range 17-64 
years) were eligible for the study. Clinically, 14 of 30 (46%) had neurologic 
signs and or symptoms. Six of the 30 patients (20%) had positive straight leg 
raising test (SLRT). Twenty-two of the 30 patients (73%) had SPECT abnormality. 
Most frequent SPECT/CT abnormality was tracer uptake in the anterior part of 
vertebral body with osteophytes/sclerotic changes. Significant positive 
agreement was noted between this finding and MRI evidence of degenerative disc 
disease. Only 13% of patients had more than one abnormality in SPECT. All 30 
patients had MRI abnormalities. The most frequent abnormality was degenerative 
disc disease and facet joint arthropathy. MRI showed single intervertebral disc 
abnormality in 36% of the patients and more than one intervertebral disc 
abnormality in remaining 64% patients. Fifteen of the 30 patients had facet 
joint arthropathy. 60% of these patients had involvement of more than one level 
facet joints while 38% had associated inter vertebral disc disease. 83% of the 
patients with positive SLRT had SPECT and MRI abnormalities. 100% of patients 
with neurologic symptoms had SPECT and MRI abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: Addition of hybrid SPECT/CT data will help differentiate incidental 
from significant MRI abnormalities as all patients with LBP have MRI 
abnormalities and most have MRI abnormalities at multiple sites. Tracer uptake 
in the anterior part of the vertebral body represents degenerative disc disease. 
MRI is sensitive and SPECT/CT is specific for facet joint arthropathy. Both 
investigations are best used complementary to each other.

Biomechanical evaluation of three surgical scenarios of posterior lumbar 
interbody fusion by finite element analysis.

Changchun, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: For the treatment of low back pain, the following three scenarios of 
posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) were usually used, i.e., PLIF procedure 
with autogenous iliac bone (PAIB model), PLIF with cages made of PEEK (PCP 
model) or titanium (Ti) (PCT model) materiel. But the benefits or adverse 
effects among the three surgical scenarios were still not fully understood.
METHOD: Finite element analysis (FEA), as an efficient tool for the analysis of 
lumbar diseases, was used to establish a three-dimensional nonlinear L1-S1 FE 
model (intact model) with the ligaments of solid elements. Then it was modified 
to simulate the three scenarios of PLIF. 10 Nm moments with 400 N preload were 
applied to the upper L1 vertebral body under the loading conditions of 
extension, flexion, lateral bending and torsion, respectively.
RESULTS: Different mechanical parameters were calculated to evaluate the 
differences among the three surgical models. The lowest stresses on the bone 
grafts and the greatest stresses on endplate were found in the PCT model. The 
PCP model obtained considerable stresses on the bone grafts and less stresses on 
ligaments. But the changes of stresses on the adjacent discs and endplate were 
minimal in the PAIB model.
CONCLUSIONS: The PCT model was inferior to the other two models. Both the PCP 
and PAIB models had their own relative merits. The findings provide theoretical 
basis for the choice of a suitable surgical scenario for different patients.

BACKGROUND: A lesion of the lumbar posterior apophyseal end plate in children 
and adolescents causes symptoms similar to those associated with a herniated 
disc. However, the end-plate lesion and the herniated disc differ in terms of 
pathology. The purpose of this study was to clarify the long-term clinical and 
radiographic outcomes in children and adolescents who were treated either 
surgically or conservatively for a lumbar posterior apophyseal end-plate lesion.
METHODS: We identified twenty-four consecutive patients who had been treated in 
the sports clinic of our hospital. The mean age at the first medical examination 
was 14.5 years. The mean follow-up time was 13.8 years. The mean age at the time 
of final follow-up was 28.4 years. All twenty-four patients had symptomatic low 
back pain with sciatica. All but two were active in sports. Sixteen patients 
were treated conservatively, and eight patients underwent surgical intervention. 
Skeletal maturity was evaluated on the basis of the appearance of the secondary 
ossification center of L3.
RESULTS: The apophyseal stage ("A" stage), which was assigned when the secondary 
ossification center of the vertebral body was visible on radiographs, was seen 
most frequently. Both the surgically treated group and the conservatively 
treated group demonstrated progressive disc degeneration at the involved level. 
The average Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) score was 1.3 for the 
patients treated conservatively and 1.8 for those treated surgically, a 
nonsignificant difference. One patient developed spinal stenosis after twelve 
years of conservative treatment. One patient treated surgically demonstrated 
severe lumbar instability. There were no significant associations between the 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and RDQ scores. Histological 
examination of surgical specimens showed irregular alignment of the anulus 
fibrosus, with degenerative matrix and chondrocytes without a nucleus.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term outcome for patients with a posterior end-plate 
lesion is favorable, regardless of whether it is treated surgically or 
nonsurgically.

Partial lumbosacral transitional vertebrae: 2 cases of unilateral sacralization.

Muir JM(1).

Author information:
(1)MSc Student, Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster 
University, Hamilton, ON, Canada L8V 4S9.

OBJECTIVE: Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) are relatively common 
skeletal anomalies with a debated role in low back pain. There are few 
documented cases of conservative care being used to address LSTV-associated 
symptomatology. The current report discusses chiropractic management of 2 
patients with unilateral sacralization.
CLINICAL FEATURES: Two patients with LSTV involving unilateral sacralization of 
L5, a Castellvi type IIIa variant, presented with back pain to a chiropractic 
clinic. Each case presented with symptomatology similar to piriformis syndrome.
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Manual therapy, including spinal manipulation soft 
tissue therapies and exercise/stretching, was used to address the presenting 
symptoms. Approximately 2 weeks after initial treatment, the first patient 
subjectively reported a 70% improvement in symptoms, with lumbar extension 
increased to full in active range of motion at the lumbar spine but with 
continued tenderness and hypertonicity at the left piriformis and gluteus 
medius. After 4 weeks of treatment, the second patient reported improvement in 
pain and perceived mobility, although prolonged standing remained an aggravating 
factor. Although both showed improvement, neither case resulted in complete 
resolution of symptoms.
CONCLUSION: The presenting cases demonstrated partial resolution of symptoms 
after chiropractic management. It is proposed that sacralization is a possible 
cause of back pain in these cases.

Modic changes: prevalence, distribution patterns, and association with age in 
white men.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Suspected as a cause of back pain, Modic changes (MCs) have 
received increasing attention in spine research and care. Yet, epidemiologic 
knowledge of MCs based on the general population, which may provide an important 
clinical reference, is limited.
PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and distribution patterns of MCs in the 
lumbosacral spine and their associations with age in a large population-based 
sample of men.
STUDY DESIGN: An epidemiologic investigation of lumbar magnetic resonance images 
(MRIs).
PATIENT SAMPLE: This study was based on the Twin Spine Study database, 
comprising a sample of male twins shown to be largely representative of the base 
Finnish population. Lumbar spine MRIs (1.5 Tesla Magnetom; Siemens AG, Erlangen, 
Germany) of 561 subjects (mean age, 49.8 years; range, 35-70 years) were 
included in the present study.
METHODS: For each spine, all 11 end plates (L1-S1) in the lumbar region were 
evaluated using both T1- and T2-weighted images to identify MCs, which were 
classified into Type 1, 2, 3, and mixed types. Furthermore, the number and 
location of MCs were recorded, as well as the anteroposterior (AP) and 
transverse sizes, to explore the prevalence and distribution pattern of MCs in 
the lumbar region and associations with age.
RESULTS: Modic changes were identified in 55.6% (312) of individuals and 13.5% 
(830) of end plates studied. Among these MCs, 64.2% (533) were Type 2, 16.0% 
(133) were Type 1, 18.1% (150) were Mixed Type 1/2, and the remaining 1.6% (13) 
were noted as Type 3 or Mixed Type 2/3. Modic changes were more common in the 
lower (74.5%) than in the upper lumbar region (25.5%), and 77.9% (642) of MCs 
presented in pairs at opposing end plates of a disc. Moreover, the specific type 
of MCs on opposing end plates was usually concordant. The presence of MCs in the 
lumbar region was associated with age (odds ratio=1.05-1.08 for each additional 
year of age, depending on type of MCs, p<.001). In addition, greater age was 
associated with a greater number of end plates affected and MCs of larger size 
(p<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Modic changes are common MRI findings in the lumbar spines of 
middle-aged white men, with Type 2 MCs predominating. Mainly present in the 
lower lumbar region, MCs tend to affect both end plates adjacent to a disc 
simultaneously, and they commonly involve the entire AP diameter of the 
vertebral end plate. The presence and size of MCs are clearly related to age, 
suggesting that aging or associated factors may play an essential role in the 
pathogenesis of MCs.

Spinal arachnoid cysts in the pediatric population: report of 31 cases and a 
review of the literature.

Author information:
(1)Division of Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of 
Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

OBJECT: The goal of this study was to review all cases of pediatric spinal 
arachnoid cysts (SACs) surgically treated at the authors' institution between 
1992 and 2008 and to compare these cases to the published literature for the 
general population.
METHODS: The charts of all pediatric patients with SACs were reviewed for 
demographics, medical history, presenting symptoms, imaging findings, operative 
procedure(s), complications, and outcomes. Following a complete literature 
review, the pediatric data were compared with data from the general population 
and unique findings associated with pediatric patients were identified.
RESULTS: Thirty-one pediatric patients (median age 6.9 years) underwent 
operative intervention for SACs between 1992 and 2008 (median duration of 
follow-up 4.2 years). There were 17 female patients (55%) and 14 male patients 
(45%). Twenty-one patients (68%) presented with symptoms of radiculopathy or 
myelopathy. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (42%), lower-extremity 
weakness (39%), gait instability (32%), spasticity (19%), sensory loss (10%), 
and bladder dysfunction (7%). In 3 patients (10%) SACs were incidental findings. 
Intradural SACs were more common (18 patients, 58%) than extradural SACs (11 
patients, 36%). One patient (3%) had extradural and intradural components. One 
patient (3%) had a purely intramedullary cyst, and 1 patient (3%) had both an 
intradural and intramedullary component. Of the 18 intradural SACs, 9 (50%) were 
located ventral to the spinal cord and 9 (50%) were dorsally situated. One 
dorsal intradural SAC had an intramedullary component. All extradural SACs were 
located dorsal to the spinal cord. Intradural SACs were primarily concentrated 
in the cervical and thoracic regions (67%), whereas extradural cysts were more 
evenly distributed between the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions. Of the 18 
patients with intradural SACs, 13 (72%) had significant previous CNS 
abnormalities, compared with 3 (27%) of 11 patients with extradural SACs. There 
were 2 operative complications. One patient had a CSF leak treated with a lumbar 
drain, and the second patient had a pseudomeningocele. No patients had 
neurological deterioration as a result of surgical intervention. Twenty-one 
patients (68%) had complete remission of symptoms, 6 (19%) had improvement, 3 
(10%) were stable, and 1 (3%) has worsening of symptoms with recurrence that 
ultimately required cystoperitoneal shunting, despite multiple failed attempts 
at fenestration.
CONCLUSIONS: Spinal arachnoid cysts are rare lesions in the pediatric 
population. Affected patients present with back pain, weakness, and/or gait 
instability. In children, SACs predominantly develop in the thoracic region and 
are more likely to occur intradurally, compared with SACs in the general 
population. Overall outcomes following surgical fenestration or excision of SACs 
are excellent, with complete remission or improvement of symptoms achieved in 
87% of cases.

Approximately 4%-8% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis develop clinically 
significant genitourinary infection. In the case being reported, a 30-year-old 
female, admitted with right-sided back swelling, local pain and low-grade fever. 
The swelling gradually increased in size over a period of 6 months and had burst 
spontaneously forming a pus discharging with associated localised pain and fever 
bringing the patient to the hospital. X-ray lumbar spine, chest and kidney 
ureter bladder showed no abnormalities. Ultrasound findings were suggestive of 
pyonephrosis with a posterior paraspinal abscess with a sinus tract within the 
posterior paraspinal region. CT findings were more conclusive in suggesting the 
sinus tract origin. Finding of tuberculous kidney and upper ureteric stricture 
with sinus tract opening in the posterior paraspinal region was made on CT. 
Right nephrectomy was done. Histopathologically proved it to be tuberculous 
kidney.

Extraspinal findings at lumbar spine CT examinations: prevalence and clinical 
importance.

(1)Department of Medical Imaging, London Health Sciences Centre-University 
Hospital, London, ON, Canada.

PURPOSE: To prospectively determine the prevalence and clinical importance of 
extraspinal abnormalities in adult outpatients undergoing computed tomography 
(CT) of the lumbar spine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this 
prospective study. Informed consent was obtained from 400 consecutive adult 
outpatients (mean age, 49 years; 212 male and 188 female patients) undergoing 
lumbar spine CT for low back pain and/or radiculopathy. Those with known 
malignancy were excluded. Dedicated spinal and abdominal full-field-of-view 
(FOV) images for each patient were reviewed by at least one neuroradiologist and 
two body radiologists. Extraspinal abnormalities were classified according to 
the CT Colonography Reporting and Data System (C-RADS). The electronic medical 
record of the patients with C-RADS E3 and E4 extraspinal findings were reviewed 
to assess how many of these findings were previously unknown, and the patients 
were followed up 24-36 months after the initial CT to determine their work-up 
and outcome.
RESULTS: Extraspinal findings were present on images in 162 (40.5%) of 400 
lumbar spine CT examinations; 59 (14.8%) patients had indeterminate or 
clinically important findings requiring clinical correlation or further 
evaluation. After review of the electronic medical record, the prevalence of 
clinically important findings was 4.3%, comprising an early-stage renal cell 
carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 
sarcoidosis, and 13 abdominal aortic aneurysms. Excluding anatomic variants, the 
full FOV was required to best visualize extraspinal abnormalities in 127 (79.4%) 
of 160 patients.
CONCLUSION: Reviewing the full-FOV images from lumbar spine CT examinations will 
result in the detection of a small number of substantial extraspinal pathologic 
findings in addition to many benign incidental findings.

BACKGROUND: Joint pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint of morbidly obese 
patients that can result in gait abnormalities, perceived mobility limitations, 
and declining quality of life (QOL). It is not yet known whether weight loss 3 
months after bariatric surgery can induce favorable changes in joint pain, gait, 
perceived mobility, and QOL. Our objectives were to examine whether participants 
who had undergone bariatric surgery (n = 25; laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding) demonstrate improvements in 
joint pain, gait (speed, stride/step length, width of base of support, toe 
angles, single/double support, swing and stance time, functional ambulatory 
profile), mobility, and QOL by 3 months compared with nonsurgical controls (n = 
20). The setting was an orthopedics laboratory at a university hospital in the 
United States.
METHODS: The present study was a prospective, comparative study. Numeric pain 
scales (indicating the presence and severity of pain), mobility-related surveys, 
and the Medical Outcomes Study short-form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) were 
completed, and gait and walking speed were assessed at baseline and at month 3.
RESULTS: The bariatric group lost an average of 21.6 ± 7.7 kg. Significant 
differences existed between the 2 groups at month 3 in step length, heel to heel 
base of support, and the percentage of time spent in single and double support 
during the gait cycle (all P <.05). The severity of low back pain and knee pain 
decreased by 54% and 34%, respectively, with no changes in the control group (P 
= .05). The walking speed increased by 15% in the bariatric group (108-123 cm/s; 
P <.05) but not in the control group. Compared with the control group, fewer 
bariatric patients perceived limitations with walking and stair climbing by 
month 3. The bariatric group had a 4.8-cm increase in step length, 2.6% increase 
in single support time during the gait cycle, and 2.5-cm reduction in the base 
of support (all P <.05). The SF-36 physical component scores increased 11.8 
points in the bariatric group compared with the control group, which showed no 
improvement by month 3 (P <.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in some, but not all, gait parameters, walking speed, 
and QOL and of perceived functional limitations occur by 3 months after a 
bariatric procedure.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether whole-body 
vibration (WBV) is associated with prolapsed lumbar intervertebral disc (PID) 
and nerve root entrapment among patients with low-back pain (LBP) undergoing 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: A consecutive series of patients referred for lumbar MRI because of LBP 
were compared with controls X-rayed for other reasons. Subjects were questioned 
about occupational activities loading the spine, psychosocial factors, driving, 
personal characteristics, mental health, and certain beliefs about LBP. Exposure 
to WBV was assessed by six measures, including weekly duration of professional 
driving, hours driven at a spell, and current 8-hour daily equivalent 
root-mean-square acceleration A(8). Cases were sub-classified according to 
whether or not PID/nerve root entrapment was present. Associations with WBV were 
examined separately for cases with and without these MRI findings, with 
adjustment for age, sex, and other potential confounders.
RESULTS: Altogether 237 cases and 820 controls were studied, including 183 
professional drivers and 176 cases with PID and/or nerve root entrapment. Risks 
associated with WBV tended to be lower for LBP with PID/nerve root entrapment 
but somewhat higher for risks of LBP without these abnormalities. However, 
associations with the six metrics of exposure were all weak and not 
statistically significant. Neither exposure-response relationships nor increased 
risk of PID/nerve root entrapment from professional driving or exposure at an 
A(8) above the European Union daily exposure action level were found.
CONCLUSIONS: WBV may be a cause of LBP but it was not associated with PID or 
nerve root entrapment in this study.

    Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 2012 Jun 1;37(13):1184.

STUDY DESIGN: Intensity of pain and level of disability (Oswestry Disability 
Index [ODI]) were compared with the relative size of Modic type 1 (M1) and Modic 
type 2 (M2) lesions. Clinical symptoms of patients having mixed M1-M2 lesion (n 
= 49) were compared with patients having a "pure" M1 lesion (n = 13).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation of the sizes of M1 and M2 lesions and the 
type of Modic lesion (mixed M1-M2 or pure M1 lesion) with intensity of low back 
pain and level of perceived disability.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Endplate signal abnormalities, particularly M1 
changes indicating edema and inflammation, have been suggested to play an 
important role in the etiopathogenesis of a subgroup of patients with 
nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, their association with 
clinical symptoms has not been studied in detail previously.
METHODS: Sixty-two CLBP patients with a large M1 lesion were selected from CLBP 
patients who were sent for the first time for standard lumbar spine magnetic 
resonance imaging at a university hospital. To exclude other causes of CLBP, as 
far as possible, strict exclusion criteria were used: any specific back disease, 
even a slight nerve root compression, a recent or major spine operation, or age 
older than 65 years. The relative sizes of M1 and M2 lesions were visually 
estimated from sagittal images for comparison with clinical symptoms.
RESULTS: The majority of patients (91.9%; 57 of 62) had an M1 lesion at a single 
level, 92% of the lesions being at L4-L5 or L5-S1 level. Forty-nine patients 
(79.0%) had a mixed M1-M2 lesion, and 13 (21.0%) had a pure M1 lesion. The mean 
of the pain intensity score was 6.2, and, correspondingly, the Oswestry 
Disability Index was 30.4. The mean relative sagittal area of the largest M1 
lesion was 24.6% (SD = 16.2), and that of the M2 lesion was 10.9% (SD = 11.6). 
Neither the pain intensity nor the ODI scores were found to correlate with the 
largest relative size of the M1 lesion. The patients with "pure" M1 lesion had 
statistically significantly more clinical symptoms than patients having a mixed 
M1-M2 lesion.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the size of M1 lesion does not directly correlate 
with the clinical symptoms but that the type of Modic lesion is more important. 
This study supports the previous observations that when the inflammatory process 
turns to the mixed M1-M2 lesions, clinical symptoms decrease.

The objective of this study is to estimate the value of diffusion-weighted MRI 
(DWI) in the detection of abnormalities in sacroiliac joints in the patients 
with early ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and investigate the feasibility of 
whole-body DWI (WB-DWI) in systemic evaluation of AS. Sixteen patients with 
early AS, 18 patients with simple low back pain (LBP), and 18 healthy volunteers 
were involved in this study. All subjects underwent conventional MRI and DWI. 
Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in subchondral bone marrows of sacroiliac 
joints was measured. Independent-sample t test was used to statistically analyze 
the difference of ADC values between groups. WB-DWI was performed in additional 
12 patients with clinically confirmed AS. The image results were analyzed by 
multiple post-processing techniques, as compared to conventional MRI. In AS 
patients, mean ADC values were (0.494 ± 0.170) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in sacrum and 
(0.513 ± 0.129) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in ilium, which were significantly higher than 
those of LBP ((0.306 ± 0.057) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in sacrum and (0.323 ± 0.083) × 
10(-3) mm(2)/s in ilium) and healthy volunteers ((0.315 ± 0.009) × 10(-3) 
mm(2)/s in sacrum and (0.319 ± 0.012) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in ilium). No statistical 
differences were found between simple LBP and healthy volunteers. Mean ADC value 
of multiple lesions in AS was (0.932 ± 0.299) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. By WB-DWI, 
abnormal signals of sacroiliac joints and extra-sacroiliac joint lesions were 
demonstrated in the locations corresponding with clinical findings. Mean ADC 
values of multiple lesions were (1.298 ± 0.323) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in sacrum and 
(1.216 ± 0.311) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in ilium. DWI and WB-DWI were shown to be 
effective in differentiation and systemic evaluation of early AS. Both 
techniques are likely to play an importance role in the early diagnosis of AS 
and assessment of treatment response.

Research on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for treating symptoms of a 
wide range of medical conditions has proliferated in recent decades. Mindfulness 
is the cultivation of nonjudgmental awareness in the present moment. It is both 
a practice and a way of being in the world. Mindfulness is purposefully 
cultivated in a range of structured interventions, the most popular of which is 
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), followed by mindfulness-based 
cognitive therapy (MBCT). This paper begins with a discussion of the 
phenomenological experience of coping with a chronic and potentially 
life-threatening illness, followed by a theoretical discussion of the 
application of mindfulness in these situations. The literature evaluating MBIs 
within medical conditions is then comprehensively reviewed, applying a levels of 
evidence rating framework within each major condition. The bulk of the research 
looked at diagnoses of cancer, pain conditions (chronic pain, low back pain, 
fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, diabetes, human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 
irritable bowel syndrome. Most outcomes assessed are psychological in nature and 
show substantial benefit, although some physical and disease-related parameters 
have also been evaluated. The field would benefit from more adequately powered 
randomized controlled trials utilizing active comparison groups and assessing 
the moderating role of patient characteristics and program "dose" in determining 
outcomes.

India.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: The occurrence of multiple tumors of different 
histopathologies in the central nervous -system is rare. Here, we report a case 
of a child with dual neuroepithelial tumors of different histological cell types 
and -review the available literature for analyzing the causal hypo-thesis.
CASE REPORT: A 7-year-old girl presented with history of headaches associated 
with multiple episodes of early morning projectile vomiting and visual blurring. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-defined lesion in the 
hypothalamic region. The patient underwent resection of the tumor by the 
transcallosal transfornicial approach. Histopathology was suggestive of 
pilocytic astrocytoma. After 3 years, the patient presented with low back pain 
radiating to the right lower limb followed by sudden onset of weakness in both 
lower limbs. Recent MRI brain and spine scans showed a small residual lesion at 
the hypothalamus with D1 to D10 syrinx. A T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense 
cystic lesion from D10 to S2 with intensely enhancing solid component at the S1, 
S2 region was also detected. The patient underwent L4 to S2 laminectomy and the 
histopathological examination revealed myxopapillary ependymoma.
CONCLUSION: The presence of multiple neuroepithelial tumors of different 
histopathology in the same patient is extremely rare, and we report one such 
case of dual gliomas with hypothalamic pilocytic astrocytoma and cauda equina 
myxopapillary ependymoma in a 10-year-old patient. During the course of 
development, displacement and dedifferentiation of primitive totipotent 
neuroepithelial germ cells may be a causal factor for the appearance of the 
different neuroepithelial tumors in neuraxis concomitantly or subsequently, 
which might be substantiated by common cytogenetic abnormalities in different 
neuroepithelial tumor histogenesis.

[Clinical manifestations and neuroradiological findings of CARASIL with a novel 
mutation].

A 44-year-old female was referred to our department for the evaluation of 
diffuse leukoencephalopathy. She had exhibited lumbago and gait disturbance due 
to lumbar spondylosis in the third decade of her life. She had become bed-ridden 
at 42 of age. Besides, she had developed with cognitive decline and decreased 
speech in her early forties. Consanguinity was recognized in her family 
pedigree, such that her father and her maternal grandmother were cousins. One of 
her elder brothers was found to have developed similar neurological 
abnormalities. She had never been hypertensive. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid 
examinations were negative. Cranial MRI revealed extensive white matter lesions, 
but there were no abnormal findings in her MRA. Locally decreased cerebral blood 
flow was revealed by cranial SPECT. Despite the lack of alopecia, we considered 
the diagnosis of cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical 
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL). Her DNA analysis disclosed a novel 
mutation (c.G821A, p.R274Q) with homozygosity, also identified in the affected 
elder brother. The in vitro assay for TGFβ repressor activity of HTRA1 implied 
that the appearance of CARASIL-associated alopecia was independent of TGFβ 
repressor activity. Longitudinally performed MR spectroscopy showed that her 
leukoenceplopathy was characterized by early demyelination and intact axonal 
integrity.

Kinematic analysis quantifies gait abnormalities associated with lameness in 
broiler chickens and identifies evolutionary gait differences.

This is the first time that gait characteristics of broiler (meat) chickens have 
been compared with their progenitor, jungle fowl, and the first kinematic study 
to report a link between broiler gait parameters and defined lameness scores. A 
commercial motion-capturing system recorded three-dimensional temporospatial 
information during walking. The hypothesis was that the gait characteristics of 
non-lame broilers (n = 10) would be intermediate to those of lame broilers 
(n = 12) and jungle fowl (n = 10, tested at two ages: immature and adult). Data 
analysed using multi-level models, to define an extensive range of baseline gait 
parameters, revealed inter-group similarities and differences. Natural selection 
is likely to have made jungle fowl walking gait highly efficient. Modern broiler 
chickens possess an unbalanced body conformation due to intense genetic 
selection for additional breast muscle (pectoral hypertrophy) and whole body 
mass. Together with rapid growth, this promotes compensatory gait adaptations to 
minimise energy expenditure and triggers high lameness prevalence within 
commercial flocks; lameness creating further disruption to the gait cycle and 
being an important welfare issue. Clear differences were observed between the 
two lines (short stance phase, little double-support, low leg lift, and little 
back displacement in adult jungle fowl; much double-support, high leg lift, and 
substantial vertical back movement in sound broilers) presumably related to mass 
and body conformation. Similarities included stride length and duration. 
Additional modifications were also identified in lame broilers (short stride 
length and duration, substantial lateral back movement, reduced velocity) 
presumably linked to musculo-skeletal abnormalities. Reduced walking velocity 
suggests an attempt to minimise skeletal stress and/or discomfort, while a 
shorter stride length and time, together with longer stance and double-support 
phases, are associated with instability. We envisage a key future role for this 
highly quantitative methodology in pain assessment (associated with broiler 
lameness) including experimental examination of therapeutic agent efficacy.

A rare cause of low back pain: report of a tailgut cyst.

Joyce EA(1), Kavanagh DO, Winter DC.

Author information:
(1)Institute for Clinical Outcomes Research and Education (iCORE), St. Vincent's 
University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin 4, Ireland.

Tailgut cysts, also known as retrorectal cystic hamartomas, are rare 
developmental abnormalities that typically occur in the retrorectal space. They 
are believed to arise from remnants of the embryonic hindgut (Hjermstad and 
Helwig, 1988). They can present as incidental findings during routine 
examination but over half of patients are thought to present with symptoms. MRI 
has become the modality of choice to image these frequently misdiagnosed cysts. 
Biopsy is not recommended. Complete intact surgical excision is advised to avoid 
the potential complications of these cysts which include infection, fistula 
formation, and the possibility of malignant transformation (Hjermstad and Helwig 
(1988), Mathis et al. (2010)). We describe the case of a 46-year-old female who 
presented with a 6-month history of low back pain. CT and MRI imaging 
demonstrated a complex retrorectal lesion with supralevator and infralevator 
components. This was removed using a combined transperineal and transabdominal 
approach. Histology confirmed a tailgut cyst.

Sarcoidosis may present with musculoskeletal features or mimic rheumatic 
diseases. We report on a patient who had been initially diagnosed as having 
polymyalgia rheumatica. Because of refractory disease associated to atypical 
features such as severe inflammatory low back pain, dull and achy pain in the 
thighs, claudication of the lower limbs and bad response to corticosteroids and 
methotrexate (MTX), an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography with 
CT (FDG PET/CT) was performed. This technique disclosed data suggestive of 
arteritis of large vessels involving the ascending, arch and descending aorta as 
well as high FDG uptake in the femoral and posterior tibial arteries of both 
lower extremities. Also, increased FDG uptake was observed in the right 
paratracheal, retrotracheal, subcarinal, gastrohepatic ligament, coeliac and 
right renal hilar lymph nodes. Four lymph nodes, taken during mediastinoscopy, 
confirmed a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Treatment with adalimumab (40 mg every 2 
weeks subcutaneously) along with prednisone and MTX was initiated yielding 
progressive improvement of symptoms and normalisation of laboratory 
abnormalities. Five months after the onset of adalimumab a new FDG PET/CT showed 
complete absence of uptake of lymph nodes as well as decrease of vascular FDG 
uptake. To our knowledge, this is the first patient treated with adalimumab 
because of a large-vessel vasculitis in the setting of sarcoidosis refractory to 
conventional therapy. This case reinforces the claim that sarcoidosis should be 
considered a diagnostic challenge in the assessment of patients presenting with 
inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: We present our 35 years' experience of managing duplex kidneys 
with ectopic ureter by simple antireflux ureterocystic reimplantation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 1974 to April 2009, 36 female children, aged 
10 months to 13 years, were treated. Hutch's antireflux ureterocystic 
reimplantation was performed after preoperative location and intraoperative 
identification of the unilateral or bilateral ectopic ureters.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients had follow-up data (range 11 months to 25 years). 
Postoperatively, there were no reports of dribbling incontinence, urinary 
frequency, lumbago or recurrent fever with the exception of urinary incontinence 
in 2 patients. Cystography and intravenous pyelography performed in 27 cases 
showed no or minimal bladder-ureter reflux. Superior kidney hydronephrosis 
improved in 12 cases and showed no change in the remaining patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Antireflux ureterocystic reimplantation is a simple method to treat 
the duplex kidney with ectopic ureter with minimal induced trauma.

Radiofrequency neurotomy for treatment of low back pain in patients with minor 
degenerative spondylolisthesis.

BACKGROUND: Degenerative spondylolisthesis is one of the major causes for low 
back pain. Morphological abnormalities of the zygapophysial joints are a 
predisposing factor in the development of degenerative spondylolisthesis. 
Therefore, radiofrequency neurotomy seems to be a rational therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if radiofrequency neurotomy is effective for patients 
with low back pain and degenerative spondylolisthesis.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective practice audit.
SETTING: Single spine center
METHODS: Charts of all patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis who 
underwent treatment with radiofrequency neurotomy during a time period of 3 
years were reviewed. Only patients with magnetic resonance imaging confirming 
the diagnosis were included. Patients with a lumbar spine operation in their 
history, patients with neurological deficits, and patients with a follow-up less 
than 3 months were excluded. Patients were treated with lumbar radiofrequency 
neurotomy. Positive treatment response was defined as at least a 50% reduction 
in pain. A radiofrequency neurotomy was only performed after positive diagnostic 
medial branch blocks.
RESULTS: During a time period of 3 years, 1,490 patients were treated with 
lumbar radiofrequency neurotomy. Forty of these patients with degenerative 
spondylolisthesis were included. A significant pain reduction was achieved in 65 
% of the patients.
LIMITATIONS: This audit is retrospective and observational, and therefore does 
not represent a high level of evidence. However, to our knowledge, since this 
information has not been previously reported and no specific nonoperative 
treatment for lumbar pain in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis 
exists, it appears to be the best available research upon which to recommend 
treatment and to plan higher quality studies.
CONCLUSION: Zygapophysial joints are a possible source of pain in patients with 
spondylolisthesis. Radiofrequency neurotomy is a rational, specific nonoperative 
therapy in addition to other nonoperative therapy methods with a success rate of 
65%. This is the first study to determine the effect of radiofrequency neurotomy 
in patients with minor degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Quantitative analysis of lumbar intervertebral disc abnormalities at 3.0 Tesla: 
value of T(2) texture features and geometric parameters.

T(2) relaxation time mapping provides information about the biochemical status 
of intervertebral discs. The present study aimed to determine whether texture 
features extracted from T(2) maps or geometric parameters are sensitive to the 
presence of abnormalities at the posterior aspect of lumbar intervertebral 
discs, i.e. bulging and herniation. Thirty-one patients (21 women and 10 men; 
age range 18-51 years) with low back pain were enrolled. MRI of the lumbar spine 
at 3.0 Tesla included morphological T(1) - and T(2) -weighted fast spin-echo 
sequences, and multi-echo spin-echo sequences that were used to construct T(2) 
maps. On morphological MRI, discs were visually graded into 'normal', 'bulging' 
or 'herniation'. On T(2) maps, texture analysis (based on the co-occurrence 
matrix and wavelet transform) and geometry analysis of the discs were performed. 
The three T(2) texture features and geometric parameters best-suited for 
distinguishing between normal discs and discs with bulging or herniation were 
determined using Fisher coefficients. Statistical analysis comprised ANCOVA and 
post hoc t-tests. Eighty-two discs were classified as 'normal', 49 as 'bulging' 
and 20 showed 'herniation.' The T(2) texture features Entropy and Difference 
Variance, and all three pre-selected geometric parameters differed significantly 
between normal and bulging, normal and herniated, and bulging and herniated 
discs (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that T(2) texture features and 
geometric parameters are sensitive to the presence of abnormalities at the 
posterior aspect of lumbar intervertebral discs, and may thus be useful as 
quantitative biomarkers that predict disease.

Case report: imaging findings in a "butterfly" vertebra.

Boulet C(1), Schiettecatte A, De Mey J, De Maeseneer M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, UZ Brussel, Jette, Belgium.

A "butterfly" vertebra is a rare congenital anomaly, presenting as a sagittal 
cleft in the vertebral body. In the literature it has been described as an 
isolated finding, but it can also be associated with various syndromes, such as 
Alagille, Jarcho-Levin, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndrome. We present a case of a 
35-year old man with chronic low back pain. The diagnosis of a butterfly 
vertebra of S1 with disc space narrowing of L5-S1 was made. Usually the 
abnormality occurs at the thoracolumbar spine and we are not aware of a 
description of a sacral butterfly vertebra. Although a butterfly vertebra is 
usually asymptomatic, it could lead to discal herniation or chronic back pain 
due to alteration in spinal biomechanics.

exercise-induced low back pain intensity.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Findings on imaging of noncontractile anatomic abnormalities 
and the intensity of low back pain have weak associations because of 
false-positive rates among asymptomatic individuals. This association might be 
stronger for contractile tissues.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between 
location and reports of pain intensity in the low back and exercise-induced 
muscle damage to the lumbar paraspinal muscles.
STUDY DESIGN: Nondiagnostic observational study in a laboratory setting.
METHODS: Delayed onset muscle soreness was induced in the low back of healthy 
pain-free volunteers. Measures of pain intensity (100-mm visual analog scale 
[VAS]) and location (area on the pain diagram) were taken before and 48 hours 
after exercise. Muscle damage was quantified using mechanical pain thresholds, 
motor performance deficits, and transverse relaxation time (T2)-weighted 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Changes pre- to postexercise in signal 
intensity on T2-weighted imaging within the erector spinae, pain intensity, pain 
area, mechanical pain threshold, and isometric torque were assessed using paired 
t tests. Bivariate correlations were conducted to assess associations among 
muscle damage, pain intensity, and pain drawing area.
RESULTS: Twenty participants volunteered (11 women; average age, 22.3 years; 
average body mass index, 23.5) for study participation. Reports of pain 
intensity at 48 hours ranged from 0 to 59 mm on the VAS. Muscle damage was 
confirmed by reductions in mechanical threshold (p=.011) and motor performance 
(p<.001) and by changes in T2-weighted MRI (p=.007). This study was powered to 
find an association of at least r=0.5 to be statistically significant. 
Correlations of continuous variables revealed no significant correlations 
between pain intensity and measures of muscle damage (ranging between -0.075 and 
0.151). There was a significant association between the remaining torque deficit 
at 48 hours and pain area.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that there was no association 
between the magnitude of muscle damage in the lumbar erector spinae and reported 
pain intensity in the low back. In future studies, larger cohorts may report 
statistically significant associations, but our data suggest that there will be 
low magnitude potentially indicating limited clinical relevance.

Central nervous system reorganization in a variety of chronic pain states: a 
review.

Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44104, USA. henryd@ccf.org

Chronic pain can develop from numerous conditions and is one of the most 
widespread and disabling health problems today. Unfortunately, the 
pathophysiology of chronic pain in most of these conditions, along with 
consistently effective treatments, remain elusive. However, recent advances in 
neuroimaging and neurophysiology are rapidly expanding our understanding of 
these pain syndromes. It is now clear that substantial functional and structural 
changes, or plasticity, in the central nervous system (CNS) are associated with 
many chronic pain syndromes. A group of cortical and subcortical brain regions, 
often referred to as the "pain matrix," often show abnormalities on functional 
imaging studies in persons with chronic pain, even with different pain locations 
and etiologies. Changes in the motor and sensory homunculus also are seen. Some 
of these CNS changes return to a normal state with resolution of the pain. It is 
hoped that this knowledge will lead to more effective treatments or even new 
preventative measures. The purpose of this article is to review recent advances 
in the understanding of the CNS changes associated with chronic pain in a number 
of clinical entities encountered in the field of physical medicine and 
rehabilitation. These clinical entities include nonspecific low back pain, 
fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, postamputation phantom pain, and 
chronic pain after spinal cord injury.

Evidence for shared pain mechanisms in osteoarthritis, low back pain, and 
fibromyalgia.

Staud R(1).

Gainesville, FL 32610-0221, USA. staudr@ufl.edu

Osteoarthritis (OA), low back pain (LBP), and fibromyalgia (FM) are common 
chronic pain disorders that occur frequently in the general population. They are 
a significant cause of dysfunction and disability. Why some of these chronic 
pain disorders remain localized to few body areas (OA and LBP), whereas others 
become widespread (FM) is unclear at this time. Genetic, environmental, and 
psychosocial factors likely play an important role. Although patients with OA, 
LBP, and FM frequently demonstrate abnormalities of muscles, ligaments, or 
joints, the severity of such changes is only poorly correlated with clinical 
pain. Importantly, many patients with these chronic pain disorders show signs of 
central sensitization and abnormal endogenous pain modulation. Nociceptive 
signaling is actively regulated by the central nervous system to allow adaptive 
responses after tissue injuries. Thus, abnormal processing of tonic peripheral 
tissue impulse input likely plays an important role in the pathogenesis of OA, 
LBP, or FM. Tonic and/or intense afferent nociceptive barrage can result in 
central sensitization that depends on facilitatory input from brainstem centers 
via descending pain pathways to the spinal cord. Abnormal endogenous control of 
these descending pathways can lead to excessive excitability of dorsal horn 
neurons of the spinal cord and pain. Ineffective endogenous pain control and 
central sensitization are important features of OA, LBP, and FM patients.

Pierre Wertheimer Hospital, Hospices Civil de Lyon, Lyon, France.

BACKGROUND: Hemivertebra frequently occurs in pediatric patients and is treated 
with vertebral excision to stop the progression of the deformity. A case of L3 
hemivertebra associated with lumbar kyphoscoliosis in an adult is reported.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old woman presented with severe chronic back pain of 
6 years' duration. Radiologic examinations showed that the L3 vertebra had a 
trapezoidal shape revealing a partially segmented hemivertebra.
RESULTS: The patient underwent a two-stage corrective surgery. The first stage 
consisted of a transpedicular osteotomy (TPO) with posterior instrumentation 
from L1 to L5 and a bone graft; 1 month later, anterior interbody fusions were 
performed at L2-3 and L3-4 using interbody cages and bone morphogenetic protein. 
No postoperative complication was reported after 2 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: TPO improved clinical symptoms, corrected the spinal deformity, and 
reduced the lumbar kyphosis.

Celiac disease presenting as severe osteopenia.

Mulder CJ(1), Cardile AP, Dickert J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 
USA.

The authors describe a unique presentation of celiac disease as multiple 
non-traumatic fractures in a young male without gastrointestinal complaints. A 
29-year-old man presented with back pain and was found to have a non-traumatic 
compression fracture of the lumbar and thoracic spine on plain X-ray. 
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) confirmed osteoporosis at the L3/L4 
vertebral bodies. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and vitamin D levels were 
normal. He had no gastrointestinal complaints, but serologic studies were 
positive to include an elevated gliadin IgA Ab, gliadin IgG Ab, and an elevated 
tissue transglutaminase IgA Ab. He was treated with a gluten-free diet, calcium, 
and vitamin D supplementation as well as teriparatide. Follow up bone density 
showed improvement and has no further fractures to date. Primary care 
physicians, gastroenterologists, and endocrinologists must have a high index of 
clinical suspicion for celiac disease in any patient who presents with low bone 
density regardless of the serum 25-OH vitamin D levels or presence of 
gastrointestinal complaints.

Progressive high-grade spondylolisthesis can lead to spinal imbalance. 
High-grade spondylolisthesis is often reduced and fused in unbalanced pelvises, 
whereas in-situ fusion is used more often in balanced patients. The surgical 
goal is to recreate or maintain sagittal balance but if anatomical reduction is 
necessary, the risk of nerval damage with nerve root disruption in worst cases 
is increased. Spinal dysraphism like spina bifida or tethered cord syndrome make 
it very difficult to achieve reduction and posterior fusion due to altered 
anatomy putting the focus on anterior column support. Intensive neural structure 
manipulation should be avoided to reduce neurological complications and 
re-tethering in these cases. A 26-year-old patient with a history of 
diastematomyelia, occult spina bifida and tethered cord syndrome presented with 
new onset of severe low back pain, and bilateral L5/S1 sciatica after a fall. 
The X-ray demonstrated a grade III spondylolisthesis with spina bifida and the 
MRI scan revealed bilateral severely narrowed exit foramina L5 due to the 
listhesis. Because she was well balanced sagittally, the decision for in-situ 
fusion was made to minimise the risk of neurological disturbance through 
reduction. Anterior fusion was favoured to minimise manipulation of the 
dysraphic neural structures. Fusion was achieved via isolated access to the 
L4/L5 disc space. A L5 transvertebral hollow modular anchorage (HMA) screw was 
passed into the sacrum from the L4/L5 disc space and interbody fusion of L4/L5 
was performed with a cage. The construct was augmented with pedicle screw 
fixation L4-S1 via a less invasive bilateral muscle split for better anterior 
biomechanical support. The postoperative course was uneventful and fusion was CT 
confirmed at the 6-month follow-up. At the last follow-up, she worked full time, 
was completely pain free and not limited in her free-time activities. The 
simultaneous presence of high-grade spondylolisthesis and spinal dysraphism make 
it very difficult to find a decisive treatment plan because both posterior and 
anterior treatment strategies have advantages and disadvantages in these 
challenging cases. The described technique combines several surgical options to 
achieve 360° fusion with limited access, reducing the risk of neurological 
sequelae.

Practical neurology - 3: Back pain and leg weakness.

Kleinig TJ(1), Brophy BP, Maher CG.

Author information:
(1)Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, SA. timothy.kleinig@health.sa.gov.au

Back pain is very common; it has a point prevalence of 25% and is the third most 
common reason for consultation in Australian general practice. A thorough 
history and examination can identify the minority of patients who require urgent 
neuroimaging or other targeted investigations. Careful correlation of clinical 
and radiological findings is required when abnormal neurological findings are 
detected. Radiological investigations may detect abnormalities at multiple 
levels but cannot confirm which level is primarily responsible for a patient's 
symptoms. A trial of conservative treatment is appropriate, even in cases of 
radiculopathy. Most patients with an acute episode of back pain recover within 
6-12 weeks, but at least a third go on to have a recurrent episode within 1 
year. Various invasive treatments, such as transforaminal steroid injection and 
discectomy, may speed up recovery from radiculopathy, but the long-term benefits 
of invasive treatment are uncertain.

Predictors of long-term pain and disability in patients with low back pain 
investigated by magnetic resonance imaging: a longitudinal study.

BACKGROUND: It is possible that clinical outcome of low back pain (LBP) differs 
according to the presence or absence of spinal abnormalities on magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), in which case there could be value in using MRI 
findings to refine case definition of LBP in epidemiological research. We 
therefore conducted a longitudinal study to explore whether spinal abnormalities 
on MRI for LBP predict prognosis after 18 months.
METHODS: A consecutive series of patients aged 20-64 years, who were 
investigated by MRI because of mechanical LBP (median duration of current 
episode 16.2 months), were identified from three radiology departments, and 
those who agreed completed self-administered questionnaires at baseline and 
after a mean follow-up period of 18.5 months (a mean of 22.2 months from MRI 
investigation). MRI scans were assessed blind to other clinical information, 
according to a standardised protocol. Associations of baseline MRI findings with 
pain and disability at follow-up, adjusted for treatment and for other 
potentially confounding variables, were assessed by Poisson regression and 
summarised by prevalence ratios (PRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 240 (74%) of the patients who had 
agreed to be followed up. Among these 111 men and 129 women, 175 (73%) reported 
LBP in the past four weeks, 89 (37%) frequent LBP, and 72 (30%) disabling LBP. 
In patients with initial disc degeneration there was an increased risk of 
frequent (PR 1.3, 95%CI 1.0-1.9) and disabling LBP (PR 1.7, 95%CI 1.1-2.5) at 
follow-up. No other associations were found between MRI abnormalities and 
subsequent outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the MRI abnormalities examined are not 
major predictors of outcome in patients with LBP. They give no support to the 
use of MRI findings as a way of refining case definition for LBP in 
epidemiological research.

Radiographic features of intraluminal leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava: 
an atypical case report.

University Medical School, China.

We encountered a 74-year-old woman with a chief complaint of progressive 
right-sided back pain for more than 1 month. Physical examination and laboratory 
tests revealed no abnormalities. Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) showed 
dilatation of the inferior vena cava (IVC). An intraluminal mass of about 8.1 × 
5.5 × 3.6 cm in size was found in the IVC, with big central necrosis and 
irregular peripheral enhancement. The tumor arose from the IVC just beneath the 
renal vein and reached the iliac bifurcation. Cavography demonstrated a filling 
defect with complete occlusion of the IVC and extensive collateral circulation. 
The patient underwent complete resection of tumor and vascular prosthetic graft. 
Pathological diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma. Because of its low incidences and 
atypical appearance, we highlight the significance of the imaging feature in its 
diagnosis in this article.

INTRODUCTION: Imaging of heel enthesopathy in spondyloarthritis (SpA) could 
potentially be useful for diagnosis and monitoring. The aim of this study was to 
assess the diagnostic capacities of MRI and power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) 
of the heel to distinguish patients with SpA from controls and to distinguish 
between patients with SpA with and without enthesopathy.
METHODS: A cross-sectional single-centre study was performed in 51 patients (102 
heels) with definite SpA according to Amor's criteria. Patients with 
degenerative non-inflammatory low back pain (n=24, 48 heels) were included as 
controls. Bilateral heel MRI and PDUS were performed by two senior 
musculoskeletal radiologists blinded to the clinical and biological data on the 
same day as the clinical evaluation. The data were analysed by patient and by 
heel.
RESULTS: Neither MRI nor PDUS could discriminate between patients with SpA and 
controls; bone oedema on MRI was the only abnormality specific to SpA (94%), but 
with a poor sensitivity (22%). However, among patients with SpA, painful heels 
had more inflammatory abnormalities (81% by MRI, 58% by PDUS) than heels with no 
pain (56% at MRI, 17% at PDUS).
CONCLUSION: Heel MRI and PDUS frequently show inflammatory lesions in SpA, 
particularly in painful heels. However, they were also often abnormal in 
controls. These results suggest that heel MRI and PDUS cannot be used for the 
diagnosis of SpA. However, PDUS and MRI may be useful for the depiction and 
assessment of enthesis inflammatory lesions in patients with SpA with heel pain.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is often associated with low back pain (LBP). Despite 
empirical evidence that LBP induces gait abnormalities, there is a lack of 
quantitative analysis of the combined effect of obesity and LBP on gait. The aim 
of our study was to quantify the gait pattern of obese subjects with and without 
LBP and normal-mass controls by using Gait Analysis (GA), in order to 
investigate the cumulative effects of obesity and LBP on gait.
METHODS: Eight obese females with chronic LBP (OLG; age: 40.5 ± 10.1 years; BMI: 
42.39 ± 5.47 Kg/m(2)), 10 obese females (OG; age: 33.6 ± 5.2 years; BMI: 39.26 ± 
2.39 Kg/m(2)) and 10 healthy female subjects (CG; age: 33.4 ± 9.6 years; BMI: 
22.8 ± 3.2 Kg/m(2)), were enrolled in this study and assessed with video 
recording and GA.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: OLG showed longer stance duration and shorter step 
length when compared to OG and CG. They also had a low pelvis and hip ROM on the 
frontal plane, a low knee flexion in the swing phase and knee range of motion, a 
low dorsiflexion in stance and swing as compared to OG. No statistically 
significant differences were found in ankle power generation at push-off between 
OLG and OG, which appeared lower if compared to CG. At hip level, both OLG and 
OG exhibited high power generation levels during stance, with OLG showing the 
highest values.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that the association of obesity and LBP 
affects more the gait pattern than obesity alone. OLG were in fact characterised 
by an altered knee and ankle strategy during gait as compared to OG and CG. 
These elements may help optimizing rehabilitation planning and treatment in 
these patients.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Research on lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) has 
yielded important information on the structural alterations of the sacrum 
associated with LSTV. Nevertheless, very little data are available on the 
relationship of a given type of LSTV with either a typical pattern of sacral 
morphology or its gender distribution in the population.
PURPOSE: To investigate the probable relationship between different variants of 
LSTVs with sacral morphology at the articular surfaces of the bone and the 
gender distribution of the anomalies in the population.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study involving dried human sacral 
bones and meta-analysis of data available related to LSTVs.
METHODS: Three hundred twenty sacra were screened for the presence of LSTV, the 
type of auricular surface, and facet joints in them. Samples were grouped 
against their sexes, type of the auricular surfaces present in them, the nature 
of facet joints, and the variety of LSTV (if present). Data on LSTV from 
reliable Internet databases were collected to account for the prevalence of LSTV 
in the population in terms of the types of the anomaly and their gender 
distribution.
RESULTS: The detection rates of LSTV in the present study were similar to those 
observed in available literature. Accessory L5-S1 articulations and 
lumbarization of S1 were more commonly observed in the women. Sacralization was 
seen to be predominantly distributed in men. Higher auricular surfaces were 
associated with accessory articulations; lower auricular surfaces were present 
with partially separated S1 segment and in L5-S1 specimens. Morphology of the 
facets significantly altered in LSTV with accessory articulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Different lumbosacral transitions share a stronger, definite, and 
specific patterns of relationship with certain sacral morphologies and gender. 
It is important to recognize the nuances of these connections so as to 
understand low back pain conditions in the setting of a typical sacral articular 
morphology or the sex of the individual.

Nodular cutaneous amyloidosis.

Borowicz J(1), Shama L, Miller R.

Author information:

A 56-year-old white man presented with a lesion on the right shoulder. The 
lesion developed during a short period and recently became irritated with 
occasional bleeding and mild pruritus. The patient denied pain. Medical history 
included melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, 
hyperlipidemia, multinodular thyroid goiter, and obesity. Medications and family 
and social history were noncontributory. Review of systems was negative. 
Examination revealed a slightly raised, friable yellow-pink waxy plaque located 
on the right shoulder (Figure 1). There was no evidence of excoriation, 
secondary infection, drainage, scale, crust, atrophy, lichenification, or 
telangiectasia. The patient had no mucosal or nail changes and the remainder of 
his skin examination was normal. A shave biopsy on the right shoulder revealed a 
nodular deposit of homogenous eosinophilic material associated with extravasated 
erythrocytes within the dermis. An infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells 
was associated with the deposits. Immunohistochemical stains revealed positive 
plasma cells with kappa light chain and negative with lambda light chain. Congo 
red stain was positive and supported the diagnosis. The findings were consistent 
with nodular cutaneous amyloidosis (NCA) of the amyloid light-type. Initial 
work-up included referrals to hematology/oncology and to general surgery. The 
patient had a complete blood cell count (CBC), complete metabolic profile (CMP), 
serum protein electrophoresis (S-PEP), urine protein electrophoresis (U-PEP), 
24-hour urine creatinine clearance, and protein, serum immunoglobulins and 132 
microglobulin. These were all within normal limits. Abdominal/pelvic computed 
tomography and positron emission tomography scan also were within normal limits. 
Bone marrow biopsy showed no abnormalities. The patient underwent both an 
abdominal fat pad biopsy as well as a colonoscopy with rectal biopsy. Both were 
negative for amyloidosis. Initially, the patient's cutaneous amyloidosis 
remained localized and mild pruritus was controlled with low potency topical 
steroids. The patient was closely monitored by hematology/oncology and general 
surgery on a biannual basis to assess the possibility of progression to systemic 
amyloidosis. Over the course of the subsequent two years, the patient developed 
multiple similar lesions across the back, shoulders, and chest, which were 
biopsied and found to be consistent with NCA. Progression of the cutaneous 
nodules led to disfiguring, painful, and friable pink to yellow waxy papules 
coalescing into plaques with obvious hemorrhage diffusely over the trunk (Figure 
2). In lieu of the painful and disfiguring progression of disease, the patient 
desired a more aggressive treatment plan. At present, the treatment option 
recommended to the patient is carbon dioxide laser ablation. Hematology/oncology 
recommendation consists of a general systemic amyloid reevaluation annually, 
including CBC, CMP, S-PEP, U-PEP, 24-hour urine collection with creatinine 
clearance, and history and physical examination.

The prevalence of transitional vertebrae in the lumbar spine.

Apazidis A(1), Ricart PA, Diefenbach CM, Spivak JM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York, 
NY 10003, USA.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTVs) are a congenital 
vertebral anomaly of the L5-S1 junction in the spine. This alteration may 
contribute to incorrect identification of a vertebral segment, leading to 
wrong-level spine surgery and poor correlation with clinical symptoms. Although 
several studies describe the occurrence of this anomaly in back pain 
populations, investigation of the prevalence in the American general population 
is lacking.
PURPOSE: To establish the prevalence rates for LSTVs in the general population.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Consecutive kidney-urinary bladder (KUB) radiographs of subjects 
from the past 2 years (2008-2009).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical demographics, number of lumbar vertebrae, L5-S1 
transverse process (TP) height, and rib length.
METHODS: Consecutive adult KUB studies of adult subjects were queried with clear 
visibility of the last rib's vertebral body articulation, all lumbar TPs, and 
complete sacral wings. Exclusion criteria consisted of any radiologic evidence 
of previous lumbosacral surgery that would obstruct our measurements. A total of 
1,100 abdominal films were reviewed, and 211 were identified as being adequate 
for the measurement of the desired parameters.
RESULTS: Two hundred eleven subjects were identified as eligible for the study, 
and 75 (35.6%) were classified as positive for a transitional lumbosacral 
vertebra. The most common anatomical variant was the Castellvi Type IA (14.7%). 
The average age at the time of the KUB study was 59.8 years (18-95 years). One 
hundred ninety-seven subjects (93.4%) presented five lumbar (nonribbed) 
vertebrae, and only 14 (6.6%) had six lumbar vertebrae.
CONCLUSIONS: The significance of lumbosacral transitional level changes to the 
establishment of pain, degenerative changes, stenosis, and disc disease have 
been well documented in symptomatic patients. Although LSTV's role in low back 
pain remains controversial, our study has shown that, when the same criteria are 
used for classification, prevalence among the general population and symptomatic 
patients may be similar.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of vertebral fractures as a complication 
of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence and 
characteristics of spinal abnormalities in 50 children (aged 7.0-18.7 years) 
with treatment-resistant JIA by magnetic resonance imaging. Vertebral 
deformities, endplate irregularities, intervertebral disc involvement, spinal 
canal, neural foramina, and back muscles were analyzed and correlated with 
clinical characteristics and bone mineral density.
RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed various abnormalities in 31 
patients (62%). Vertebral compression was seen in 28%, disc degeneration in 46%, 
protrusions in 14%, prolapses in 4%, endplate changes in 26%, and anterior 
vertebral corner lesions in 16%. Two patients (4%) had mild spinal canal 
narrowing without medullar involvement; none had neural root compression. Six 
patients (12%) had mild back muscle atrophy. No correlation was observed between 
spinal fractures or other vertebral changes and disease activity or duration, 
pain or bone mineral density; patients with spinal fractures tended to have a 
higher recent glucocorticoid exposure (P=.086).
CONCLUSION: Children with severe JIA have a high prevalence of compression 
fractures and other vertebral, endplate, and disc abnormalities in the thoracic 
and lumbar spine.

Pedicle marrow signal hyperintensity on short tau inversion recovery- and 
t2-weighted images: prevalence and relationship to clinical symptoms.

(1)Imaging, Institutes, and Quantitative Health Sciences (N.O.), Cleveland 
Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lumbar pedicle marrow hyperintense signal on T2- and 
STIR-weighted images is not an uncommon finding. We hypothesize that these 
marrow signal intensity changes and their behavior within the pedicle are 
associated with clinical symptoms and that their improvement or resolution 
correlates with clinical improvement. We investigated the prevalence of these 
pedicle marrow changes, associated morphologic abnormalities, and the 
relationship to symptoms over time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prevalence was evaluated prospectively in 246 patients 
and retrospectively in 400 patients. To analyze the relationship between changes 
in signal intensity over time and symptoms, a third group of 30 patients was 
followed clinically for assessment of pain and functional limitation and with MR 
studies for 18 months or until signal intensity changes resolved.
RESULTS: The prevalence of pedicle marrow hyperintensity on T2 and STIR-weighted 
sequences was 1.7%. Associated morphologic abnormalities were pars 
interarticularis and pedicle fractures and degenerative facets. In the 
longitudinal study, pedicle marrow signal hyperintensity on T2- and 
STIR-weighted images resolved in 17 patients and persisted in 5 patients. The 
extent, intensity, and resolution of signal intensity changes significantly 
related to the degree of functional limitation (P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Resolution of pedicle marrow hyperintensity on T2 and STIR-weighted 
images was associated with improved functional testing and a trend toward 
decreased pain.

Treatment of a patient with post-natal chronic calf pain utilizing 
instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization: a case study.

Musculoskeletal pain is commonly reported by pre- and postnatal women, with the 
most common complaint being low back pain. However, lower leg pain is also 
frequently reported by women particularly in the third trimester. The purpose of 
the case study is to illustrate how instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization 
(ISTM) can be used to treat a patient with a 2-year history of chronic calf 
pain. The subject was a 35-year-old female who developed calf pain during the 
last trimester of her pregnancy following severe lower leg edema. The calf pain 
was present for the 2 years following delivery and was described as a dull ache, 
typically aggravated by direct pressure on the calf, prolonged standing, and 
stairs. An X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, and ultrasound 
Doppler study prior to referral ruled out tumors, vascular, lymphatic, or 
skeletal bone abnormalities. However, her MRI did show a dense superficial 
venous tissue asymmetry in the same location of her symptoms. Impairments were 
minimal; the only asymmetrical objective findings were calf length, strength, 
and soft tissue restrictions detected on palpation. After nine treatments 
incorporating an ISTM approach, soft tissue mobility, pain, calf strength, and 
lower extremity functional scale score all improved and her symptoms were 
abolished.

A very rare cause of low-back pain and sciatica: deep vein thrombosis due to 
absence of the inferior vena cava mimicking the clinical and radiological signs 
of lumbar disc herniation.

The authors report a very rare cause of low-back pain and sciatica in a patient 
with iliac vein thrombosis attributed to absence of the infrarenal segment of 
the inferior vena cava (IVC) with massively dilated venous collaterals draining 
via a paraspinal plexus into the azygous system. This 21-year-old man presented 
with acute low-back pain radiating to the left ventral thigh. The initial CT 
scan revealed an intraspinal lesion that mimicked lumbar disc herniation. 
Further clarification revealed an iliac vein thrombosis, which was triggered by 
the absence of the infrarenal segment of the IVC, a very rare vascular anomaly. 
Collateral venous return was developed and led to lumbar varicosities and 
epidural vein engorgements. Laboratory examinations revealed factor V mutation 
as a predisposing factor for thrombosis. The patient's symptoms were relieved 
with anticoagulation and antiinflammatory therapy. Absence of the infrarenal IVC 
associated with iliac vein thrombosis should be regarded as a very rare cause of 
radicular and low-back pain, and this condition can mimic the clinical and 
radiological signs of lumbar disc herniation. Sciatica might be the first 
clinical manifestation of this rare venous anomaly.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the imaging findings of patients with clinical symptoms of 
lower back pain who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar 
spine with axial loading.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 120 patients by MRI, before and after axial 
loading, using a compression device that applied 50% of their body weight for a 
load time of 5min. The dural sac cross area (DSCA) was examined by two 
experienced radiologists before and after axial load, and their findings were 
compared. Degenerative abnormalities within and adjacent to the spinal canal 
were also analyzed.
RESULTS: A reduction in DSCA greater than 15mm(2) after axial load was defined 
as significant, and was found in 81 patients (67.5%) and 138 disc spaces 
(38.3%). Reduction was most frequent at L4-L5 (n=55). For other disorders, a 9% 
increase in cases of bulging disc was seen during axial loading, and seven disc 
spaces showed protrusion/extrusion only after load. Facet joint synovial cysts, 
foraminal stenosis, and hypertrophy of the flavum ligaments showed almost no 
differences, pre- and post-load.
CONCLUSION: For adequate evaluation of lumbar symptoms, examination should be 
performed with axial loading, especially in cases of suspected spinal stenosis.

Appropriate use of diagnostic imaging in low back pain: a reminder that 
unnecessary imaging may do as much harm as good.

UT 84606, USA. tim@colpts.com

The rate of lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging in the United States is 
growing at an alarming rate, despite evidence that it is not accompanied by 
improved patient outcomes. Overutilization of lumbar imaging in individuals with 
low back pain correlates with, and likely contributes to, a 2- to 3-fold 
increase in surgical rates over the last 10 years. Furthermore, a patient's 
knowledge of imaging abnormalities can actually decrease self-perception of 
health and may lead to fear-avoidance and catastrophizing behaviors that may 
predispose people to chronicity. The purpose of this clinical commentary is as 
follows: (1) to describe an outline of the appropriate use, as defined in recent 
guidelines, of diagnostic imaging in patients with low back pain; (2) to 
describe how inappropriate use of lumbar spine imaging can increase the risk of 
patient harm and contributes to the recent large increases in healthcare costs; 
(3) to provide physical therapists with clear guidelines to educate patients on 
both appropriate imaging and information to dampen the potential negative 
effects of imaging on patients' perceptions and health; and (4) to present an 
example of a successful clinical pathway that has reduced imaging and improved 
outcomes.

Reduction mammaplasty in a developing country: a guideline for plastic surgeons 
for patient selection.

BACKGROUND: In Ghana and most developing countries there has been no 
standardized study of reduction mammaplasty (RM) in patients with symptomatic 
macromastia (SM), despite its debilitating effects. This study aimed to analyze 
the physical and psychological effects associated with female patients who 
underwent reduction mammaplasty and to develop a guideline for plastic surgeons 
in developing countries to know the most important signs and symptoms to 
consider in SM patients.
METHODS: From 2003 to 2009, all females with SM who visited Komfo Anokye 
Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana, for RM were given a questionnaire 
designed to evaluate SM-related physical and psychological effects. These 
patients were then provided the same questionnaire at their final visit 5 months 
postoperatively to assess the effects of RM on SM.
RESULTS: Sixty-three patients who underwent RM were evaluated, with a mean age 
of 28.5 years. Twenty-seven (42.9%) patients reported that their macromastia 
started during puberty, with 3 (4.8%) patients associating the onset with 
pregnancy. Thirty (47.6%) patients reported having SM for more than 10 years. 
Multiple regression analysis revealed upper- and lower-back pain (p=0.0005), 
painful bra strap grooves (p=0.0041), teasing (p=0.01), and poor self-image 
(p=0.021) to be significant factors for which patients underwent RM. 
Postoperatively, most of the patients' physical symptoms resolved, while 2 
(3.2%) patients complained of residual psychological effects.
CONCLUSION: RM offers substantial symptomatic relief for patients with SM and 
results in significant improvement in the patient's quality of life. This study 
conclusively demonstrates that, upper- and lower-back pain, painful bra strap 
grooves, teasing, and poor self-image should be considered by plastic surgeons 
before deciding which SM patient to treat when confronted with numerous SM 
patients.

Chronic pain is associated with reduced brain gray matter and impaired cognitive 
ability. In this longitudinal study, we assessed whether neuroanatomical and 
functional abnormalities were reversible and dependent on treatment outcomes. We 
acquired MRI scans from chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients before (n = 18) 
and 6 months after (spine surgery or facet joint injections; n = 14) treatment. 
In addition, we scanned 16 healthy controls, 10 of which returned 6 months after 
the first visit. We performed cortical thickness analysis on structural MRI 
scans, and subjects performed a cognitive task during the functional MRI. We 
compared patients and controls, as well as patients before versus after 
treatment. After treatment, patients had increased cortical thickness in the 
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was thinner before treatment 
compared with controls. Increased DLPFC thickness correlated with the reduction 
of both pain and physical disability. Additionally, increased thickness in 
primary motor cortex was associated specifically with reduced physical 
disability, and right anterior insula was associated specifically with reduced 
pain. Left DLPFC activity during an attention-demanding cognitive task was 
abnormal before treatment, but normalized following treatment. These data 
indicate that functional and structural brain abnormalities-specifically in the 
left DLPFC-are reversible, suggesting that treating chronic pain can restore 
normal brain function in humans.

The question as to what constitutes the ideal epidural steroid injection remains 
unresolved. We performed a prospective, randomised, double-blind, AB/BA 2 × 2 
crossover study of caudal 40 vs 80 mg methylprednisolone acetate (in 20 ml 
levobupivacaine 0.125%) in outpatients with chronic low back pain. Data from 33 
participants were analysed. The Oswestry Disability Index improved in both dose 
groups over time following injection. However, a statistically significant 
improvement was only observed in the 40 mg methylprednisolone acetate group (40 
mg: p < 0.001; 80 mg: p = 0.33). There was no statistically significant 
difference between the dose groups in change in the Oswestry Disability Index 
with respect to time. Methylprednisolone acetate 40 mg appears to be as 
effective as 80 mg in improving disability associated with chronic low back 
pain, and should be considered in preference to the 80 mg dose for outpatients 
with chronic low back pain attending for repeat caudal steroid injection.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Conflicting reports exist regarding the prevalence of Modic 
changes among low back pain (LBP) patients and factors associated with their 
existence.
PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of Modic changes and other findings on lumbar 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among Spanish adult chronic LBP patients and 
the patient characteristics and radiological findings associated with Modic 
changes.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional imaging study among chronic LBP patients.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Four hundred eighty-seven patients (263 women and 224 men) 
undergoing lumbar spine MRI examination for chronic LBP.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking exposure, 
degree of physical activity, and image features (disc degeneration, type and 
extension of Modic changes, disc contour, annular tears, spinal stenosis, and 
spondylolisthesis).
METHODS: Ten radiologists from six hospitals across six cities in Spain 
consecutively recruited adult patients in whom lumbar MRI had been prescribed 
for LBP lasting ≥3 months. Patients' characteristics and imaging findings were 
assessed through previously validated instruments. A multivariate logistic 
regression model was developed to assess the features associated with Modic 
changes.
RESULTS: Modic changes were found in 81% of the patients. The most common was 
Type II (51.3%), affecting only the end plate. Variables associated with Type I 
changes were disc contour abnormalities, spondylolisthesis, and disc 
degeneration. The same variables were associated with a higher risk of Type II 
or any type of Modic changes, as well as being male, and having a higher BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Modic changes are found in 81% (95% confidence interval, 77-85) of 
adult Spanish patients in whom an MRI is prescribed for chronic LBP. Modic 
changes are more likely to be found in males with a high BMI, who also show disc 
contour abnormalities, spondylolisthesis, or disc degeneration.

Patients with Bertolotti's syndrome have characteristic lumbosacral anomalies 
and often have severe sciatica. We describe a patient with this syndrome in whom 
standard decompression of the affected nerve root failed, but endoscopic 
lumbosacral extraforaminal decompression relieved the symptoms. We suggest that 
the intractable sciatica in this syndrome could arise from impingement of the 
nerve root extraforaminally by compression caused by the enlarged transverse 
process.

Clinical presentation of low back pain and association with risk factors 
according to findings on magnetic resonance imaging.

We hypothesised that the relative importance of physical and psychological risk 
factors for mechanical low back pain (LBP) might differ importantly according to 
whether there is underlying spinal pathology, psychological risk factors being 
more common in patients without demonstrable pathology. If so, epidemiological 
studies of LBP could benefit from tighter case definitions. To test the 
hypothesis, we used data from an earlier case-control study on patients with 
mechanical LBP who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 
lumbosacral spine. MRI scans were classified for the presence of high-intensity 
zone (HIZ), disc degeneration, disc herniation, and nerve root 
displacement/compression. Information about symptoms and risk factors was 
elicited by postal questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to assess 
associations of MRI abnormalities with symptoms and risk factors, which were 
characterised by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among 354 
patients (52% response), 306 (86.4%) had at least 1, and 63 (17.8%) had all 4 of 
the MRI abnormalities. Radiation of pain below the knee (280 patients) and 
weakness or numbness below the knee (257 patients) were both associated with 
nerve root deviation/compression (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.5; and OR 1.8, 95% CI 
1.1 to 3.1, respectively). However, we found no evidence for the hypothesised 
differences in risk factors between patients with and without demonstrable 
spinal pathology. This suggests that when researching the causes and primary 
prevention of mechanical LBP, there may be little value in distinguishing 
between cases according to the presence or absence of the more common forms of 
potentially underlying spinal pathology.

Facet dimensions, orientation, and symmetry at L5-S1 junction in lumbosacral 
transitional States.

Indore, Madhya Pradesh. mahatonk@yahoo.co.in

STUDY DESIGN: Study analyses dimensions, angular orientations, and symmetry of 
articular facets at the L5-S1 junction associated with transitional anomalies 
comprising (1) L5-S1 accessory articulations; (2) complete sacralization of the 
L5 vertebrae; and (3) completely lumbarized S1 sacral segments. Data were 
compared with same parameters evaluated in normal sacrum.
OBJECTIVE: Investigating probable morphologic differences in facet joints at the 
normal and transition affected lumbosacral junctions.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Facet joints at the L5-S1 play an important role in 
load sharing and imparting stability at this area as well as are involved in 
conditions such as isthmic spondylolysis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and 
osteoarthritis, giving rise to low back pain situations. Several morphologic 
variations at the lumbosacral junction have been studied and inconsistently 
alluded to be associated with these painful conditions. Lumbosacral transitional 
anomalies, on the other hand, have also been linked to low back pain situations. 
L5-S1 transitions have been shown to be associated with altered L5-S1 articular 
morphology as well as load-sharing pattern at the region. The analysis of L5-S1 
zygapophysial anatomy in context of transitional anomalies at this region has 
rarely been documented.
METHODS: Both the superior articulating facets in the normal as well as in 
transition associated sacra were measured for (1) height, (2) width, (3) surface 
area, and (4) angulation of the articular surfaces with reference to the 
midsagittal plane. Data were also analyzed to find structural asymmetry between 
the two sides.
RESULTS: Facets demonstrated smallest linear dimensions, surface areas, and 
maximum coronal orientation in lumbarized specimens. Facets areas associated 
with accessory articulations were also smaller and coronally oriented. 
Sacralization induced insignificant alteration in the facet morphology. 
Asymmetry (tropism) was observed in facets predominantly associated with 
accessory L5-S1 articulations.
CONCLUSIONS: L5-S1 transitions possess altered facet morphology. These 
alterations are possibly related to low back pain situations.

Influence of nomenclature in the interpretation of lumbar disk contour on MR 
imaging: a comparison of the agreement using the combined task force and the 
nordic nomenclatures.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The CTF nomenclature had not been tested in clinical 
practice. The purpose of this study was to compare the reliability and 
diagnostic confidence in the interpretation of disk contours on lumbar 1.5T MR 
imaging when using the CTF and the Nordic nomenclatures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five general radiologists from 3 hospitals blindly and 
independently assessed intravertebral herniations (Schmorl node) and disk 
contours on the lumbar MR imaging of 53 patients with low back pain, on 4 
occasions. Measures were taken to minimize the risk of recall bias. The Nordic 
nomenclature was used for the first 2 assessments, and the CTF nomenclature, in 
the remaining 2. Radiologists had not previously used either of the 2 
nomenclatures. κ statistics were calculated separately for reports deriving from 
each nomenclature and were categorized as almost perfect (0.81-1.00), 
substantial (0.61-0.80), moderate (0.41-0.60), fair (0.21-0.40), slight 
(0.00-0.20), and poor (<0.00).
RESULTS: Categorization of intra- and interobserver agreement was the same 
across nomenclatures. Intraobserver reliability was substantial for 
intravertebral herniations and disk contour abnormalities. Interobserver 
reliability was moderate for intravertebral herniations and fair to moderate for 
disk contour.
CONCLUSIONS: In conditions close to clinical practice, regardless of the 
specific nomenclature used, a standardized nomenclature supports only moderate 
interobserver agreement. The Nordic nomenclature increases self-confidence in an 
individual observer's report but is less clear regarding the classification of 
disks as normal versus bulged.

Effect of increased MRI and CT scan utilization on clinical decision-making in 
patients referred to a surgical clinic for back pain.

Li AL(1), Yen D.

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont., Canada.

BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the association between radiologic and 
clinical diagnoses and to measure the impact of more magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans on clinical decision-making in patients 
referred to a surgical clinic for back pain.
METHODS: We conducted a 7-week prospective study of patients referred for back 
pain to spine surgeons in 1 health care centre. Patients were included if they 
had not previously been seen by a surgeon for their back problems and if their 
back pain was related to the thoracic or lumbar spine. We collected demographic 
data, imaging findings, clinical diagnoses as determined by the surgeons and 
visit outcomes and compared our results with those of a similar study conducted 
in 1996.
RESULTS: Of 160 patients, 8 (5%) were no-shows and excluded from further 
analysis owing to incomplete data. There were more MRI scans and fewer plain 
radiographs ordered in 2009 compared with 1996 (73% v. 11% and 39% v. 68%, 
respectively). Degenerative disc disease was a more common radiologic diagnosis 
(n=78, 63%) than clinical diagnosis (n=41, 27%). Disc herniation was a more 
common radiologic diagnosis (n=69, 56%) than clinical diagnosis (n=25, 16%). 
With regards to visit outcomes, there were fewer second opinions sought in 2009 
compared with 1996 (3% v. 11%). Although not statistically significant, the 
number of surgical candidates remained relatively stable (19% in 1996 v. 16% in 
2009, p=0.44).
CONCLUSION: The clinical diagnosis had a poor association with radiologic 
abnormalities. Despite an increase in the number of MRI and CT scans, the number 
of patients deemed surgical candidates has not changed.

CONTEXTE: Nous avons cherché à déterminer le lien entre les diagnostics 
radiologiques et cliniques et à mesurer l’effet d’un plus grand nombre 
d’imageries par résonance magnétique (IRM) et de tomodensitométries (TDM) sur la 
prise de décisions cliniques au sujet de patients référés à une clinique 
chirurgicale à cause de douleurs au dos.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons procédé à une étude prospective d’une durée de 7 semaines 
portant sur des patients référés à cause d’une douleur au dos à des chirurgiens 
de la colonne dans 1 centre de soins de santé. Les patients ont été inclus s’ils 
n’avaient pas été vus auparavant par le chirurgien pour leurs problèmes de dos 
et si leur douleur au dos était reliée à la colonne thoracique ou lombaire. Nous 
avons réuni des données démographiques, des données sur les résultats 
d’imagerie, des diagnostics cliniques établis par les chirurgiens et des 
résultats de consultations, et nous avons comparé nos résultats à ceux d’une 
étude semblable réalisée en 1996.
RÉSULTATS: Sur 160 patients, 8 (5 %) ne se sont pas présentés et ont été exclus 
de l’analyse à cause de données incomplètes. Il y a eu plus d’examens d’IRM et 
moins de radiographies ordinaires prescrits en 2009 qu’en 1996 (73 % c. 11 % et 
39 % c. 68 % respectivement). La discopathie dégénérative a constitué un 
diagnostic radiologique plus fréquent (n = 78, 63 %) que le diagnostic clinique 
(n = 41, 27 %). La hernie discale a constitué aussi un diagnostic radiologique 
plus fréquent (n = 69, 56 %) que le diagnostic clinique (n = 25, 16 %). En ce 
qui a trait aux résultats des consultations, on a demandé un deuxième avis moins 
souvent en 2009 qu’en 1996 (3 % c. 11 %). Même si ce n’est pas statistiquement 
significatif, le nombre de candidats à l’intervention chirurgicale est demeuré 
relativement stable (19 % en 1996 c. 16 % en 2009, p = 0,44).
CONCLUSION: Il y avait un lien faible entre le diagnostic clinique et les 
anomalies radiologiques. Même si le nombre d’examens par IRM et TDM a augmenté, 
celui des patients considérés comme candidats à une intervention chirurgicale 
n’a pas changé.

Possible role of autoimmune reaction in Modic Type I changes.

Ma XL(1), Ma JX, Wang T, Tian P, Han C.

China. mjx969@163.com

Modic changes (MCs) are common abnormalities in the vertebral endplates and 
adjacent bone marrow, which are visible on magnetic resonance imaging. They are 
regarded as having a strong association with the clinical symptom of low back 
pain (LBP). Nevertheless, the general pathogenesis of MCs is still under 
discussion. MCs can be divided into three types. Type I MCs represent extensive 
subchondral bone edema and vascular granulation tissue within the bone marrow of 
the adjacent endplate. The reasons for the edema and vascularization in Type I 
MCs, which may be the major mechanism underlying LBP, remain unclear. Chronic 
repetitive shear forces on the endplates lead to local disruption and 
microfractures. Following a breach of the outer annulus fibrous, the nucleus 
pulposus (NP) may enter the vertebral body. We hypothesize that the consequent 
autoimmune response due to a foreign body may cause and promote the development 
of edema, vascularization and inflammation, which are characteristic of Type I 
MCs. The production of cytokines evoked by autoimmunity could therefore be 
responsible for the significant clinical symptoms of LBP. If this underlying 
etiological pathway is proven, MCs and the consequent LBP could be treated by 
novel clinical methods.

CONTEXT: Identifying objective measures that correlate with somatic dysfunction 
palpatory findings will aid in establishing clinical relevance of the findings 
and provide outcome measures for future studies.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of altered segmental lumbar vertebral 
mechanics (ie, somatic dysfunction) as assessed by palpation with bone mineral 
density (BMD) T-score variability in participants, some with chronic low back 
pain (CLBP) and others without low back pain (LBP).
METHODS: Individuals with CLBP and individuals without LBP were examined by 2 
blinded examiners for the presence or absence of paraspinal tissue texture 
abnormalities, vertebral rotational asymmetry, anterior motion restriction, and 
tenderness from L1 to L4. All participants then received a dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry scan of the lumbar spine. Bone mineral density T scores were 
compared between the CLBP and non-LBP groups.
RESULTS: Sixty-three individuals (16 CLBP, 47 non-LBP) participated in the 
study. Lumbar segments with perceivable rotational asymmetry had higher mean BMD 
T scores (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) than lumbar segments with no 
asymmetry (0.5 [0.4-0.7] vs -0.2 [-0.6 to 0.2], respectively; P=.002). 
Additionally, lumbar segments with anterior motion restriction had higher mean 
BMD T scores (95% CI) than lumbar segments with no motion restriction (0.6 
[0.4-0.7] vs 0.1 [-0.2 to 0.3], respectively; P=.03). Participants with CLBP 
demonstrated higher regional mean lumbar BMD T scores (95% CI) than those 
without CLBP (0.9 [0.6-1.1] vs 0.3 [0.2-0.5], respectively; P<.001). After 
accounting for sex and body mass index, vertebral segments with rotational 
asymmetry (in non-LBP participants only) and vertebral segments with motion 
restriction had higher mean BMD T scores than vertebral segments with no 
asymmetry or motion restriction.
CONCLUSION: Participants with CLBP had significantly higher lumbar BMD than 
participants without LBP. The presence of rotational asymmetry or motion 
restriction was associated with elevated BMD at the affected vertebrae.

Yat-SenUniversity, Guangzhou, China. chenjianyu5562@sina.com

OBJECTIVE: this study aimed to correlate magnetic resonance (MR) ﬁndings and 
discography with pain response at provocative discography in patients with low 
back pain.
METHODS: ninety-three patients who underwent MR imaging of the lumbar spine and 
subsequent provocation discography as part of a clinical evaluation of low back 
pain were enrolled in the study. MR images were then evaluated for disc 
degeneration, high-intensity zone (HIZ), and endplate abnormalities. In the 
procedure of discography, concordant pain was denoted as positive, whereas 
discordant pain and no pain were denoted as negative. Finally, MR and 
discographic ﬁndings were analyzed by w2 test based on results of concordant 
pain.
RESULTS: discography was conducted on 256 discs successfully, 116 discs of which 
presented with concordant pain, and the others presented with discordant pain. 
There were 141 discs we reevaluated as Grade I-III on MR images, 17 of which 
presented with concordant pain; 115 were evaluated as Grade IV-V, 99 of which 
presented with concordant pain. HIZ was found in 60 discs,52 of which had 
concordant pain. The endplate abnormalities we reobserved in 58 discs, 51 of 
which manifested concordant pain. Concordant pain was signiﬁcant correlated with 
Type IV-V discs on discography (w2=144.08, r=0.60, P<0.01), Grade IV-V disc 
degeneration on MR image (w2=137.11, r=0.59, P<0.01), the presence of HIZ 
(w2=51.93, r=0.41, P<0.01), and endplate abnormalities (w2=52.76, r=0.41, 
P<0.01).
DISCUSSION: disc degeneration grades on MR imaging showedan association with 
discographic grades. Type IV-V discs on discography, Grade IV-V disc on MR 
images, the presence of HIZ,and endplate abnormalities might indicate discogenic 
pain inpatients with chronic low back pain.

Potential of magnetic resonance imaging findings to refine case definition for 
mechanical low back pain in epidemiological studies: a systematic review.

Endean A(1), Palmer KT, Coggon D.

Author information:
(1)MRC Epidemiology Resource Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, 
United Kingdom.

STUDY DESIGN: systematic review and meta-analysis.
OBJECTIVE: to assess how confidently low back pain (LBP) can be attributed to 
abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thereby explore the 
potential value of MRI abnormalities in refining case definition for mechanical 
LBP in epidemiological research.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: most epidemiological studies of mechanical LBP have 
defined cases only by reported symptoms, but it is possible that the potency of 
causes differs depending on whether there is demonstrable underlying spinal 
pathology.
METHODS: we reviewed the published data on MRI abnormalities, looking for data 
on the repeatability of their assessment, their prevalence in people free from 
LBP, and their association with LBP. Where data were sufficient, we calculated a 
summary estimate of prevalence in people without LBP and a meta-estimate of the 
odds ratio for the association with LBP. A formula was then applied to estimate 
the corresponding prevalence rate ratio, assuming 3 possible prevalence rates 
for LBP in the general population.
RESULTS: data were most extensive for disc protrusion, nerve root displacement 
or compression, disc degeneration, and high intensity zone, all of which could 
be assessed repeatedly. All were associated with LBP, meta-estimates of odds 
ratios ranging from 2.3 (nerve root displacement or compression) to 3.6 (disc 
protrusion). However, even for disc protrusion, estimates of the corresponding 
prevalence rate ratios were mostly less than 2.
CONCLUSION: MRI findings of disc protrusion, nerve root displacement or 
compression, disc degeneration, and high intensity zone are all associated with 
LBP, but individually, none of these abnormalities provides a strong indication 
that LBP is attributable to underlying pathology. This limits their value in 
refining epidemiological case definitions for LBP.

Mechanical low back pain is a common indication for Nuclear Medicine imaging. 
Whole-body bone scan is a very sensitive but poorly specific study for the 
detection of metabolic bone abnormalities. The accurate localisation of 
metabolically active bone disease is often difficult in 2D imaging but single 
photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) allows 
accurate diagnosis and anatomic localisation of osteoblastic and osteolytic 
lesions in 3D imaging. We present a clinical case of a patient referred for 
evaluation of chronic lower back pain with no history of trauma, spinal surgery, 
or cancer. Planar whole-body scan showed heterogeneous tracer uptake in the 
lumbar spine with intense localisation to the right lateral aspect of L3. 
Integrated SPECT/CT of the lumbar spine detected active bone metabolism in the 
right L3/L4 facet joint in the presence of minimal signs of degenerative 
osteoarthrosis on CT images, while a segment demonstrating more gross 
degenerative changes was more quiescent with only mild tracer uptake. The 
usefulness of integrated SPECT/CT for anatomical and functional assessment of 
back pain opens promising opportunities both for multi-disciplinary clinical 
assessment and treatment for manual therapists and for research into the 
effectiveness of manual therapies.

An unusual presentation of osteogenesis imperfecta type I.

Rebelo M(1), Lima J, Vieira JD, Costa JN.

Author information:
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Coimbra, Coimbra, 
Portugal.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare inherited disorder with a broad spectrum 
of clinical and genetic variability. The genetic diversity involves, in the 
majority of the cases, mutations in one of the genes that encodes the type 1 
collagen protein (COL1 A1 and COL1 A2), but it is not a requirement for the 
diagnosis. The most benign form is OI type I. The authors present a case report 
of a 25-year-old woman who had severe low back pain associated with incapacity 
to walk and breast-feed post-partum. Symptoms developed 2 weeks after delivery. 
The radiological examination revealed severe osteoporosis with no abnormalities 
in the laboratory findings. The clinical signs and a positive personal and 
family history of multiple fractures in childhood suggested OI type I, although 
other diagnosis, such as pregnancy-associated osteoporosis, was also considered. 
The atypical presentation of this rare disorder in adulthood calls attention to 
the need for early diagnosis for prompt treatment. Treatment of OI is never 
curative, but it improves the quality of the patient's life.

Endovascular radiofrequency ablation for varicose veins: an evidence-based 
analysis.

Medical Advisory Secretariat.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the MAS evidence review was to conduct a systematic 
review of the available evidence on the safety, effectiveness, durability and 
cost-effectiveness of endovascular radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the 
treatment of primary symptomatic varicose veins.
BACKGROUND: The Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) met on 
August 26th, 2010 to review the safety, effectiveness, durability, and 
cost-effectiveness of RFA for the treatment of primary symptomatic varicose 
veins based on an evidence-based review by the Medical Advisory Secretariat 
(MAS). CLINICAL CONDITION: Varicose veins (VV) are tortuous, twisted, or 
elongated veins. This can be due to existing (inherited) valve dysfunction or 
decreased vein elasticity (primary venous reflux) or valve damage from prior 
thrombotic events (secondary venous reflux). The end result is pooling of blood 
in the veins, increased venous pressure and subsequent vein enlargement. As a 
result of high venous pressure, branch vessels balloon out leading to 
varicosities (varicose veins). SYMPTOMS TYPICALLY AFFECT THE LOWER EXTREMITIES 
AND INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO): aching, swelling, throbbing, night cramps, 
restless legs, leg fatigue, itching and burning. Left untreated, venous reflux 
tends to be progressive, often leading to chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). A 
number of complications are associated with untreated venous reflux: including 
superficial thrombophlebitis as well as variceal rupture and haemorrhage. CVI 
often results in chronic skin changes referred to as stasis dermatitis. Stasis 
dermatitis is comprised of a spectrum of cutaneous abnormalities including 
edema, hyperpigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis and stasis ulceration. 
Ulceration represents the disease end point for severe CVI. CVI is associated 
with a reduced quality of life particularly in relation to pain, physical 
function and mobility. In severe cases, VV with ulcers, QOL has been rated to be 
as bad or worse as other chronic diseases such as back pain and arthritis. Lower 
limb VV is a very common disease affecting adults - estimated to be the 7th most 
common reason for physician referral in the US. There is a very strong familial 
predisposition to VV. The risk in offspring is 90% if both parents affected, 20% 
when neither affected and 45% (25% boys, 62% girls) if one parent affected. The 
prevalence of VV worldwide ranges from 5% to 15% among men and 3% to 29% among 
women varying by the age, gender and ethnicity of the study population, survey 
methods and disease definition and measurement. The annual incidence of VV 
estimated from the Framingham Study was reported to be 2.6% among women and 1.9% 
among men and did not vary within the age range (40-89 years) studied. 
Approximately 1% of the adult population has a stasis ulcer of venous origin at 
any one time with 4% at risk. The majority of leg ulcer patients are elderly 
with simple superficial vein reflux. Stasis ulcers are often lengthy medical 
problems and can last for several years and, despite effective compression 
therapy and multilayer bandaging are associated with high recurrence rates. 
Recent trials involving surgical treatment of superficial vein reflux have 
resulted in healing and significantly reduced recurrence rates. ENDOVASCULAR 
RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION FOR VARICOSE VEINS: RFA is an image-guided minimally 
invasive treatment alternative to surgical stripping of superficial venous 
reflux. RFA does not require an operating room or general anaesthesia and has 
been performed in an outpatient setting by a variety of medical specialties 
including surgeons and interventional radiologists. Rather than surgically 
removing the vein, RFA works by destroying or ablating the refluxing vein 
segment using thermal energy delivered through a radiofrequency catheter. Prior 
to performing RFA, color-flow Doppler ultrasonography is used to confirm and map 
all areas of venous reflux to devise a safe and effective treatment plan. The 
RFA procedure involves the introduction of a guide wire into the target vein 
under ultrasound guidance followed by the insertion of an introducer sheath 
through which the RFA catheter is advanced. Once satisfactory positioning has 
been confirmed with ultrasound, a tumescent anaesthetic solution is injected 
into the soft tissue surrounding the target vein along its entire length. This 
serves to anaesthetize the vein, insulate the heat from damaging adjacent 
structures, including nerves and skin and compresses the vein increasing optimal 
contact of the vessel wall with the electrodes or expanded prongs of the RF 
device. The RF generator is then activated and the catheter is slowly pulled 
along the length of the vein. At the end of the procedure, hemostasis is then 
achieved by applying pressure to the vein entry point. Adequate and proper 
compression stockings and bandages are applied after the procedure to reduce the 
risk of venous thromboembolism and to reduce postoperative bruising and 
tenderness. Patients are encouraged to walk immediately after the procedure. 
Follow-up protocols vary, with most patients returning 1 to 3 weeks later for an 
initial follow-up visit. At this point, the initial clinical result is assessed 
and occlusion of the treated vessels is confirmed with ultrasound. Patients 
often have a second follow-up visit 1 to 3 months following RFA at which time 
clinical evaluation and ultrasound are repeated. If required, additional 
procedures such as phlebectomy or sclerotherapy may be performed during the RFA 
procedure or at any follow-up visits.
REGULATORY STATUS: The Closure System® radiofrequency generator for endovascular 
thermal ablation of varicose veins was approved by Health Canada as a class 3 
device in March 2005, registered under medical device license 67865. The RFA 
intravascular catheter was approved by Health Canada in November 2007 for the 
ClosureFast catheter, registered under medical device license 16574. The Closure 
System® also has regulatory approvals in Australia, Europe (CE Mark) and the 
United States (FDA clearance). In Ontario, RFA is not an insured service and is 
currently being introduced in private clinics.

support public financing decisions. The literature search was performed on March 
9th, 2010 using standard bibliographic databases for studies published up until 
March, 2010.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: THE MAS EVIDENCE SEARCH ON THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF 
ENDOVASCULAR RFA ABLATION OF VV IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING EVIDENCE: three HTAs, 
nine systematic reviews, eight randomized controlled trials (five comparing RFA 
to surgery and three comparing RFA to ELT), five controlled clinical trials and 
fourteen cohort case series (four were multicenter registry studies). The 
majority (12⁄14) of the cohort studies (3,664) evaluating RFA for VV involved 
treatment with first generation RFA catheters and the great saphenous vein (GSV) 
was the target vessel in all studies. Major adverse events were uncommonly 
reported and the overall pooled major adverse event rate extracted from the 
cohort studies was 2.9% (105⁄3,664). Imaging defined treatment effectiveness of 
vein closure rates were variable ranging from 68% to 96% at post-operative 
follow-up. Vein ablation rate at 6-month follow-up was reported in four studies 
with rates close to 90%. Only one study reported vein closure rates at 2 years 
but only for a minority of the eligible cases. The two studies reporting on RFA 
ablation with the more efficient second generation catheters involved better 
follow-up and reported higher ablation rates close to 100% at 6-month follow-up 
with no major adverse events. A large prospective registry trial that recruited 
over 1,000 patients at thirty-four largely European centers reported on 
treatment success in six overlapping reports on selected patient subgroups at 
various follow-up points up to 5 year. However, the follow-up for eligible 
recruited patients at all time points was low resulting in inadequate estimates 
of longer term treatment efficacy. The overall level of evidence of randomized 
trials comparing RFA with surgical ligation and vein stripping (n = 5) was 
graded as low to moderate. In all trials RFA ablation was performed with first 
generation catheters in the setting of the operating theatre under general 
anaesthesia, usually without tumescent anaesthesia. Procedure times were 
significantly longer after RFA than surgery. Recovery after treatment was 
significantly quicker after RFA both with return to usual activity and return to 
work with on average a one week less of work loss. Major adverse events 
occurring after surgery were higher [(1.8% (n=4) vs. 0.4% (n = 1) than after RFA 
but not significantly. Treatment effectiveness measured by imaging defined vein 
absence or vein closure was comparable in the two treatment groups. Significant 
improvements in vein symptoms and quality of life over baseline were reported 
for both treatment groups. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

OBJECTIVE: To investigate intra- and inter-observer reliability among physical 
medicine and rehabilitation specialists and a radiologist in interpretation of 
plain lumbar spine X-ray films in patients with low back pain.
METHODS: Three assessors (A: a resident of PM&R, B: an experienced PM&R 
specialist, C: an experienced radiologist) read the standard lumbosacral plain 
radiographs of 79 patients with 2-3 month time interval. Each assessor recorded 
the presence or absence of abnormalities on the radiograph according to a 
standardized assessment form.
RESULTS: For assessors B and C, all kappa values were > 0.40. Transitional 
vertebrae abnormalities reached to the highest agreement ratio. The intrarater 
agreement showed higher kappas than the interrater agreement. The radiologists 
had the highest intrarater agreement, closely followed by the experienced PM&R 
specialist. Agreement among three assessors was substantial in sacralisation, 
lumbarisation and facet joint pathologies.
CONCLUSION: We usually obtained a good intrarater agreement, especially for the 
experienced PM&R specialist and the radiologist indicating that experience 
increases diagnostic consistency. Besides the systematic differences in 
radiographic interpretation between the assessors, institutional specific 
conditions (esp. patient profile and regularities) may cause the phycians to pay 
more attention to a specific group of pathologies.

Monterrey, Mexico.

BACKGROUND: A chondroblastoma is a primary benign bone tumor typically involving 
the epiphysis of long tubular bones. The occurrence of chondroblastoma in the 
vertebral column is exceptional. To the best of our knowledge, aspiration biopsy 
(AB) findings of a lumbar chondroblastoma have only been reported in 1 previous 
case.
CASE: A 30-year-old female presented with lower back pain with a duration of 1 
month. A CT scan of the 4th lumbar vertebra showed a heterogeneous lytic zone 
within the body and the right side pedicle surrounded by marginal sclerosis. A 
CT-fluoroscopy-guided AB was performed and rendered a relatively cellular 
material with round to oval-shaped cells with a discrete amount of cytoplasm and 
small nuclei. These cells were distributed in a single-cell manner as well as in 
groups along with multinucleated osteoclast-like cells. A cytological diagnosis 
of chondroblastoma was issued.
CONCLUSION: Identification of infrequent benign bone lesions in the vertebral 
column through AB is a challenge, yet it is of the utmost importance in order to 
render a correct diagnosis.

A 38-year-old female developed pain in the right leg in 2006. In 2007, the 
diagnosis of femoral head necrosis was made based on MR images, and femoral head 
prosthetic replacement was performed. In April 2009, she visited a local 
hospital for low back pain, and was referred to our department due to 
electrolyte abnormalities on hemanalysis. Since marked hypokalemia (K=2.5 
mEq/L), hypophosphatemia, hyperchloric metabolic acidosis, proteinuria, and 
urinary blood sugar suggested Fanconi syndrome, she was admitted for close 
examination. Bone survey showed a marked decrease in the amount of bone 
particularly in the four limbs and fracture at the proximal 1/3 of the left 
ulnar bone. In the lumbar spine, scoliosis and vertebral deformity were 
observed. Since impaired P re-absorption and unselected aminoaciduria and 
osteomalacia were also present, the diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome was made. On 
admission, ventricular tachycardia developed due to hypokalemia, requiring 
immediate electrolyte correction. For differentiation from acquired Fanconi 
syndrome, various examinations were performed. No apparent cause was found 
except for the positive antimitochondrial antibody-M2 (anti-M2). In this case, 
no data suggested liver dysfunction, and subsequent liver biopsy also showed no 
significant pathological findings pointing to PBC. We encountered a patient with 
Fanconi syndrome positive for anti-M2. This case may attract interest, 
particularly in the mechanism of nephropathy due to anti-M2, and therefore, this 
case is reported with a literature review.

Existence of two separate facet joints on the same side: case of a congenital 
anomaly.

Neurosurgery, Istanbul, Turkey.

We present a case that had two separate facet joints on the same side causing an 
intervertebral instability. The embryological pathogenesis of the congenital 
existence of two separate facet joints on the same side of the vertebra is not 
conclusively known. A 68-year-old woman presented with lower back pain and 
severe left leg pain. Neuroradiological evaluation including dynamic plain 
radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar 
spine revealed the existence of two separate facet joints on the same side of 
the first sacral vertebra, severe degenerative changes of both right and left 
L5-S1 facet joints, and Grade II L5-S1 spondylolisthesis. Subsequently, she 
underwent surgery. Intraoperatively, two separate facet joints on the same side 
of the first sacral vertebra were confirmed. The patient's symptoms were 
resolved after decompression and fusion surgery. This is a unique case of the 
congenital existence of two separate facet joints on the same side of the first 
sacral vertebra.

Chronic musculoskeletal pain, including low back pain, is a worldwide 
debilitating condition; however, the mechanisms that underlie its development 
remain poorly understood. Pathological neuroplastic changes in the sensory 
innervation of connective tissue may contribute to the development of 
nonspecific chronic low back pain. Progress in understanding such potentially 
important abnormalities is hampered by limited knowledge of connective tissue's 
normal sensory innervation. The goal of this study was to evaluate and quantify 
the sensory nerve fibers terminating within the nonspecialized connective 
tissues in the low back of the rat. With 3-dimensional reconstructions of thick 
(30-80 μm) tissue sections we have for the first time conclusively identified 
sensory nerve fiber terminations within the collagen matrix of connective tissue 
in the low back. Using dye labeling techniques with Fast Blue, presumptive 
dorsal root ganglia cells that innervate the low back were identified. Of the 
Fast Blue-labeled cells, 60-88% also expressed calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) immunoreactivity. Based on the immunolabeling with CGRP and the 
approximate size of these nerve fibers (≤2 μm) we hypothesize that they are Aδ 
or C fibers and thus may play a role in the development of chronic pain.

A 64-year-old man was admitted to hospital with increasing low back pain, 
radiating to his upper legs. MRI of the lumbar spine showed inflammatory lesions 
of vertebrae L3-L5, after which the patient was treated with flucloxacilline for 
6 weeks. However, he did not improve and the pain became more extensive. 
Finally, PET-CT study showed abnormalities in shoulders, back and hips, 
indicating a probable diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. Upon treatment with 
prednisone, the pain quickly decreased and 3 months later the inflammatory 
changes visible on MRI were clearly reduced. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is 
often recognized by its typical clinical presentation, but in atypical cases, 
investigation using imaging may be helpful. Abnormalities in shoulder and hip 
joints are most common, but signs of cervical and lumbar interspinous bursitis 
might also be found in patients with PMR.

The influence of periodized resistance training on recreationally active males 
with chronic nonspecific low back pain.

Laboratory, University of Alberta, Camrose, AB, Canada.

The most common musculoskeletal health issue is chronic nonspecific low back 
pain (CLBP). CLBP increases pain and disability, which reduces quality of life 
(QoL). Generally, pain, disability, and QoL are improved with a moderate volume 
and intensity of physical activity. Recently, periodized resistance training 
(PRT) was shown to be effective at improving CLBP in sedentary young, 
middle-age, and older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine if PRT 
would increase strength, reduce pain and disability, and improve QoL in 
recreationally active, moderately trained middle- and older-age males. 
Forty-five male subjects were divided according to age into 1 of 3 groups: (a) 
middle-age exercise (ME), (b) old-age exercise (OE), or (c) control (C). All 
subjects suffered from CLBP and were considered to be moderately trained, 
participating in recreational ice hockey for 60 minutes, 2 times per wk(-1) for 
∼5 months/year along with other recreational activities. The study ran for 16 
weeks (3-week familiarization and 13 weeks of testing and PRT) with 5 repetition 
maximum testing at baseline and weeks 8 and 12. The PRT program systematically 
and progressively overloaded all major muscle groups (whole-body workout). The 
results indicate that middle- and old-age recreationally active males with CLBP 
respond similarly in magnitude to PRT, with improvements in all outcome measures 
(strength, pain, disability, QoL) across all time points of the study. Clinical 
significance (≥ 25%) in outcome measures was reached on most variables for the 
ME and OE groups. The results suggest that PRT may be effectively applied as 
rehabilitation for moderately trained recreational athletes with CLBP.

AIM: To describe an important symptom of preeclampsia previously not defined.
METHODS: Individual clinician experience case series collected and recorded 
prospectively.
RESULTS: Little attention has been given to symptoms in the diagnosis of 
preeclampsia. Although "epigastric pain" is often mentioned, there is no 
accurate description in the literature of the specific diagnostic attributes 
that distinguish the upper abdominal pain of preeclampsia from that of other 
causes. The symptom is described herein and defined as "preeclamptic angina" 
(PEA). It is associated strongly with severe preeclampsia but often not 
recognized, particularly when it is not accompanied by usual features of 
preeclampsia. It is experienced typically as a severe pain that begins at night, 
usually maximal in the low retrosternum or epigastrium, constant and unremitting 
for 1-6 h. It may radiate or be confined to the right hypochondrium or back. The 
liver is tender on palpation. The pain may precede the diagnosis of preeclampsia 
by 7 days or more and may be the only abnormality on presentation such that 
preeclampsia is not suspected. It is of ominous prognosis and is associated with 
a high rate of maternal and fetal complications. Laboratory and clinical 
abnormalities of preeclampsia are ultimately manifest in all cases, but their 
absence at the time of presentation may lead to erroneous alternative diagnoses. 
Recognition of this characteristic symptom will lead to earlier diagnosis of 
preeclampsia in atypical cases, with the potential to avoid maternal and 
perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Gray matter volumes of pain-related brain areas are decreased in fibromyalgia 
syndrome.

University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610-0221, USA.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain disorder that is 
very prevalent in the general population (approximately 5%). Accumulating 
evidence suggests that FM is associated with central pain processing 
abnormalities, ie, central sensitization. Several previous studies of chronic 
pain patients, including FM, have shown gray matter atrophy of brain areas 
associated with sensory and affective pain processing. These findings, however, 
have not been confirmed in all FM studies. In this study, we investigated gray 
matter volumes of brain areas associated with pain-related areas of FM patients 
identified by functional brain imaging. Using voxel-based morphometric (VBM) 
analysis of magnetic resonance brain images, we compared 19 pain-related brain 
areas of 14 female FM patients and 11 healthy controls (NC). We found that FM 
patients had significantly less gray matter volumes than NC in 3 of these brain 
regions, including the anterior and mid-cingulate, as well as mid-insular 
cortices. Importantly, FM patients demonstrated neither global gray matter 
atrophy nor gray matter changes associated with depression, as shown in some 
studies. Using a more stringent analysis than other VBM studies, we provide 
evidence for decreased gray matter volumes in a number of pain-related brain 
areas in FM. Although the mechanisms for these gray matter changes are presently 
unclear, they may contribute to some of the core features of this chronic 
disorder including affective disturbances and chronic widespread pain.
PERSPECTIVE: Increasing evidence supports the association of chronic pain with 
accelerated gray matter atrophy in pain disorders like low back pain, IBS, and 
FM syndrome. However, cause-effect relationships between chronic pain and 
decreased gray matter volumes have not been established yet and will require 
future prospective studies.

[Clinical characteristics and treatment for patients with low back and leg pain 
caused by lumbar annular tears].

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether annular tears is a cause of low back and 
radiating leg pain and explore the clinical characteristics and treatment for 
patients with this condition.
METHODS: A total of 34 patients with low back and radiating leg pain, but 
without lumbar disc herniation on CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic 
resonance imaging), were examined by electrophysiological studies and 
discography to identify whether there were or not annular tears and nerve root 
injury and decipher the relations between them. The series included 15 males and 
19 females with an average age of 45.6 years old and the average duration of 
symptoms was 25.8 months. All patients with annular tears and positive pain 
provocation test were treated by local windowing decompression and debridement 
of nucleus pulposus after failed conservative treatment. The pre- and 
post-operative functions and pain were evaluated by JOA (Japanese Orthopedic 
Association) and VAS (visual analog scale) scores respectively. The average 
follow-up was 17.4 months.
RESULTS: The clinical manifestations included low back and radiating leg pain, 
intermittent claudication and nerve root injury. No significant abnormalities 
were discovered on X-ray and CT scan. T2W images of magnetic resonance 
demonstrated a low intensity or black disc in all patients and high-intensity 
zone (HIZ) (n = 21). Electromyography showed nerve root injury (n = 27). 
Abnormality of conduction velocities of common peroneal nerve (n = 7) and tibial 
nerve (n = 3) were found. Thirty-four patients with 38 discs displayed pain 
reproduction on contrast injection during discography and the sites of annular 
tears were confirmed on CT scan after discography. Pre- and post-operative 
average JOA scale score was 8.7 points and 13.5 points, the recovery ratio 76.2% 
and the excellent and good outcomes 88.2%. Pre- and post-operative average VAS 
score was 8.6 points and 2.8 points. And the recovery rate was 80.5%.
CONCLUSION: The annular tears result in low back and radiating leg pain. And the 
typical characteristics are low back and radiating leg pain, intermittent 
claudication and nerve root injury. MRI and electrophysiological studies play an 
important role in diagnosing this condition. Lumbar discography is the decisive 
method and prerequisite of selecting surgery. Local windowing decompression and 
debridement of nucleus pulposus is a simple and effective method.

Accelerated degeneration after failed cervical and lumbar nucleoplasty.

Cuellar VG(1), Cuellar JM, Vaccaro AR, Carragee EJ, Scuderi GJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York, 
NY, USA.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Studies evaluating the treatment of presumed 
discogenic spine pain using nucleoplasty have reported variable success rates. 
It has been suggested that these procedures lower the intradiscal pressure, 
reduce disk protrusion, improve disk hydration, and restore disk height. It is 
proposed that such structural changes in treated disks correspond to the 
clinical improvement in patients. Radiographic and clinical evidence showing the 
efficacy of nucleoplasty remains inadequate.
OBJECTIVE: To document the comparative changes in magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) the appearance of disk morphology as reflected by Pfirrmann classification 
scores before and after the nucleoplasty treatment in patients with continued 
symptoms.
METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with persistent symptoms after 
nucleoplasty within 1 year of treatment were evaluated. Prenucleoplasty and 
postnucleoplasty MRIs were evaluated and Pfirrmann scores of the symptomatic 
level were determined.
RESULTS: In all the treated patients, comparison between the prenucleoplasty and 
the postnucleoplasty MRI of the targeted disks failed to show increased signal 
hydration, disk space height improvement, or shrinkage of the preoperative disk 
bulge at a mean time of 6 months after the procedure. Of the 17 cervical levels 
treated in 12 patients, 5 seemed to show progressive degeneration at treated 
levels (42% of the patients). Of the 17 lumbar procedures in 16 patients, 4 
seemed to show progressive degeneration (25% of the patients) and 1 developed a 
new spondylolisthesis (6.3%). Thus, 32% of the patients in our cohort showed 
progressive degeneration at the treated level. The median Pfirrmann score in 
both prenucleoplasty and postnucleoplasty was 2, and the mean Pfirrmann 
classification prenucleoplasty and postnucleoplasty was 1.8 and 2.1, 
respectively (P<0.05, 2-tailed t test).
CONCLUSION: This study failed to detect any morphologic improvement of disk 
abnormalities by MRI evaluation in patients with persistent pain, who then 
underwent nucleoplasty. Thirty-two percent showed progressive degeneration in 
less than 1 year after nucleoplasty, a rate greater than expected by natural 
progression during the interval of examination.

Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.

STUDY DESIGN: In all, 4 cases of the coexistence of congenital spinal deformity 
(CSD) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were reviewed.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an insight into the unusual association between CSD and 
AS.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CSD combined with musculoskeletal anomalies, 
including clubfeet, Sprengel deformity, Klippel-Feil syndrome, and developmental 
dysplasia of the hip, has been described in the literature. Additionally, the 
rare coexistence between AS and other inflammatory joint diseases, such as 
systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, or Behçet 
disease, has also been reported. However, to the authors' knowledge, the 
coexistence of CSD and AS has not been described in the literature.
METHODS: In all, 4 patients presented with symptoms of lower back pain for at 
least 1 year. Among them, 3 patients (cases 1, 2, and 3) were initially 
diagnosed as CSD, and classified as butterfly vertebra in 2 patients (case 1, 
case 3), incarcerated hemivertebra in 1 patient (case 2). Furthermore, a 
diagnosis of coexistence of CSD and AS was proposed in these 3 cases with a 
delay in the diagnosis of AS for 1 to 10 years. The fourth patient sought 
initial medical attention in our hospital without delay in diagnosis. In case 1, 
polysegmental Smith-Petersen osteotomy and transpedicular fixation were 
performed, and drugs were administrated. Case 2, case 3, and case 4 were treated 
with amethopterin, folic acid, salicylazosulfapyridine, and celecoxib.
RESULTS: At the latest follow-up, 4 patients had no back pain and were satisfied 
with the outcome.
CONCLUSION: The coexistence of CSD and AS is very rare. However, it is necessary 
to consider the diagnosis of AS in CSD patients who present with symptoms such 
as inflammatory low back pain, morning stiffness, loss of global sagittal 
balance, and other clinical features can not be exclusively explained by CSD 
solely.

Tactile thresholds are preserved yet complex sensory function is impaired over 
the lumbar spine of chronic non-specific low back pain patients: a preliminary 
investigation.

Street, Fremantle, WA 6959, Australia. bwand@nd.edu.au

OBJECTIVES: To investigate impairments in sensory function in chronic 
non-specific low back pain patients, and the relationship between any impairment 
and the clinical features of the condition.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional case-control study.
SETTING: Laboratory-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: Nineteen chronic non-specific low back pain patients and 19 
healthy controls.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tactile threshold, two-point discrimination distance and 
accuracy at a task involving recognising letters drawn over the skin of the 
lower back (graphaesthesia) were assessed over the lumbar spine in both groups. 
Pain duration, pain intensity, physical function, anxiety and depression were 
assessed by questionnaire in the back pain group.
RESULTS: No difference was found in tactile threshold between the two groups 
[median difference 0.0mg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to 0.04]. There was 
a significant difference between controls and back pain patients for two-point 
discrimination (mean difference 17.9mm, 95% CI 5.9 to 29.8) and graphaesthesia 
accuracy (mean difference 6.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 11.0). Low back pain patients had a 
larger lumbar two-point discrimination distance threshold and a greater letter 
recognition error rate. In the back pain group, no relationship was found 
between clinical profile and sensory function, and no relationship was found 
between the sensory tests.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support existing findings of perceptual abnormalities in 
chronic non-specific low back pain patients, and are suggestive of cortical 
rather than peripheral sensory dysfunction. Amelioration of these abnormalities 
may present a target for therapeutic intervention.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes after lumboperitoneal shunting for CES with dural 
sac dilation and multiple arachnoid diverticula in patients with long-standing 
AS.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare complication 
of long-standing ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Neurologic symptoms occur 
insidiously and have a poor prognosis without effective treatment.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied cases seen between 1997 and 2009 at our 
university-hospital rheumatology department.
RESULTS: We identified 9 patients with AS and dural sac dilation (mean age: 64, 
range: 38-75), of whom 8 experienced CES 29.1 years on average (range: 10-51) 
after AS onset. Presenting symptoms were urinary abnormalities (n = 4), sensory 
abnormalities (n = 6), or radicular or low back pain (n = 4). The symptoms 
worsened progressively, with mild (n = 3) to severe (n = 1) motor deficiency, 
sphincter dysfunction (urinary [n = 6] and/or anal [n = 4] sphincter), and 
impotence (n = 3). Magnetic resonance imaging showed dural sac dilation (n = 9), 
multiple lumbar arachnoid diverticula (n = 6), erosions of the laminae and 
spinous processes (n = 6), and nerve-root tethering (n = 6) with adhesion to the 
dura mater and vertebrae (n = 7). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow study by 
magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 2 patients and showed communication 
of the diverticula with the CSF. Lumboperitoneal shunting, performed in 5 
patients, was followed by improvements in sensation (n = 4), urinary symptoms (n 
= 2), anal continence (n = 3), and pain. Full recovery of muscle strength was 
noted in 3 patients. Improvements persisted after a mean of 49 months (range: 
18-96).
CONCLUSION: Lumboperitoneal shunting induced substantial improvements in all 5 
patients treated with this procedure. This result suggests that AS-related CES 
may be due to chronic arachnoiditis and dural fibrosis leading to diminished CSF 
resorption with dural sac dilation and diverticula formation.

Comment in
    Photomed Laser Surg. 2011 Sep;29(9):647-8; discussion 648, 651.

OBJECTIVE: To test the therapeutic efficacy of low-level energy diode laser on 
burning mouth syndrome.
BACKGROUND: Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by burning and painful 
sensations in the mouth, especially the tongue, in the absence of significant 
mucosal abnormalities. Although burning mouth syndrome is relatively common, 
little is known regarding its etiology and pathophysiology. As a result, no 
treatment is effective in all patients. Low-level energy diode laser therapy has 
been used in a variety of chronic and acute pain conditions, including neck, 
back and myofascial pain, degenerative osteoarthritis, and headache.
METHODS: A total of 17 patients who had been diagnosed with burning mouth 
syndrome were treated with an 800-nm wavelength diode laser. A straight 
handpiece was used with an end of 1-cm diameter with the fiber end standing 4 cm 
away from the end of handpiece. When the laser was applied, the handpiece 
directly contacted or was immediately above the symptomatic lingual surface. The 
output used was 3 W, 50 msec intermittent pulsing, and a frequency of 10 Hz, 
which was equivalent to an average power of 1.5 W/cm(2) (3 W × 0.05 msec × 10 Hz 
= 1.5 W/cm(2)). Depending on the involved area, laser was applied to a 1-cm(2) 
area for 70 sec until all involved area was covered. Overall pain and discomfort 
were analyzed with a 10-cm visual analogue scale.
RESULTS: All patients received diode laser therapy between one and seven times. 
The average pain score before the treatment was 6.7 (ranging from 2.9 to 9.8). 
The results showed an average reduction in pain of 47.6% (ranging from 9.3% to 
91.8%). The burning sensation remained unchanged for up to 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Low-level energy diode laser may be an effective treatment for 
burning mouth syndrome.

Spinal "Gucuofeng" mainly is considered as abnormalities of joint function. 
Manipulative maneuver have obviously effect in adjustment of spinal "Gucuofeng", 
and the technical key point is utilization of principle of lever to achieve 
safe, effective and labor-saving purpose. After clinical practice, the general 
principle of manipulative maneuver in adjustment of spinal "Gucuofeng" can be 
summed up as pull stretch traction, first-induced instability, reverse 
adjustment,withdraw along situation.

Comment in
    J Am Osteopath Assoc. 2011 Mar;111(3):141.

CONTEXT: Few studies have shown that diagnostic palpation is reliable. No 
studies have shown that the reliability of diagnostic palpatory skills can be 
maintained and improved over time.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the reliability of selected palpatory tests 
used to identify lumbar somatic dysfunction was maintained during a 4-month 
period as part of a clinical observational study.
METHODS: Participants with low back pain and participants without low back pain, 
recruited from a rural Midwestern community, were examined during 6 separate 
sessions over a 4-month period. During each data collection session, two blinded 
examiners, who had previously completed comprehensive consensus training, 
evaluated the lumbar region with four tests: static segmental positional 
asymmetry of the transverse processes in the horizontal plane, tissue texture 
abnormalities, resistance to anterior springing on the spinous processes, and 
tenderness induced by pressure on the spinous processes. Detailed protocols for 
each test were defined during a previous comprehensive consensus training period 
and were not revised during the current study. To verify that established 
interobserver reliability was maintained throughout the clinical study, quality 
control sampling was performed on all data. When findings were inconsistent 
between the two examiners, focused consensus training was performed as a means 
of recalibration to understand why assessments were inconsistent. Interobserver 
reliability for determining the presence or absence of somatic dysfunction was 
assessed using kappa coefficients.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 64 participants, and 14 to 33 participants were 
examined per session. All four tests had acceptable interobserver reliability by 
the final data collection session. The test for static segmental positional 
asymmetry of the transverse processes in the horizontal plane had moderate to 
substantial reliability in all 6 sessions. The test for tissue texture 
abnormalities had moderate reliability in 5 of the 6 sessions. The test for 
resistance to anterior springing on the spinous processes had moderate 
reliability for 3 of the 6 sessions. The test for tenderness had substantial to 
almost perfect reliability for all 6 sessions. In general, interobserver 
reliability improved over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Examiners were able to maintain and improve interobserver 
reliability of four lumbar diagnostic palpatory tests over a 4-month period.

[Congenital hypoplasia of the lower portion of the left psoas muscle].

[Article in Croatian]

Grgić V(1).

Author information:
(1)vjekoslav.grgic@zg.t-com.hr

We are presenting a case of a 58-year-old-male patient with a congenital 
hypoplasia of the lower portion of his left psoas muscle. This rare anomaly, 
which should be differentiated from other pathological conditions (destructive 
processes, tumors, metastases, inactivate atrophy), was discovered during the 
MRI examination of his lumbosacral (LS) spine which the patient underwent due to 
deterioration of chronic low back pain. His right psoas muscle was hypertrophic. 
CT examination of his abdomen has shown the identical finding. The MRI 
examination of his LS spine has shown the intensive and extensive degenerative 
changes. Besides the hypoplasia of the lower portion of his left psoas muscle, 
the radiological examinations of the LS spine (MRI) and abdomen (CT) have not 
shown any other congenital anomalies. Taking into consideration the patient 
history, the clinical finding, the results of the radiological and other 
examinations (EMNG) as well as the well known facts about psoas muscle anatomy 
and function (a stabilizer of the lumbar spine, pelvis and hip; the hip and 
trunk flexor; the lateral trunk flexor), in this case report, we analysed the 
clinical manifestations (lateral deviation of lumbar spine; pelvic 
asymmetry--elvic torsion; increased hip extension on the side of the hypoplastic 
psoas muscle) and also the late consequences of the unilateral hypoplasia of the 
psoas muscle (unilateral hypoplasia of the psoas muscle--the overloading of the 
LS spine and the other psoas muscle--the chronic low back pain--the compensatory 
hypertrophy of the other psoas muscle-->the intensive and extensive degenerative 
changes of the LS spine).

Accidental finding of an anomalous spinal nerve root during lumbar-disc surgery: 
a case report and a review of literature.

Anomalies of lumbosacral nerve roots, even though are rare, have been well 
documented so far in the medical literature. The early diagnosis of these 
anomalies may be difficult and it is crucial to develop specific methods for 
depicting them. Preoperative diagnosis of anomalous lumbosacral spinal nerve 
roots using the magnetic resonance imaging is essential to facilitate thorough 
surgical planning in order to avoid unnecessary complications for the patient 
during surgery. The operative management of these anomalies depends on the 
patient's neurological problems and while asymptomatic and accidentally 
diagnosed cases do not require treatment, patients who suffer low back or 
sciatic pain need surgical intervention in order to decompress nerve roots. We 
report a 45-years old woman presented with severe low back pain associated with 
left lumboischialgia. Intraoperative finding of an aberrant L5/S1 nerve root, 
optimal surgical therapy and different classifications are discussed together 
with a review of literature.

Carcinoid tumors with a primary site in the central nervous system have not been 
reported in literature yet. We report here about a 41-year-old patient with 
recurrent and progressive low back pain and bilateral S1 radiculopathy on 
admission. The patient underwent hemi-laminectomies of the vertebral bodies L5 
and S1 and an en bloc resection of the tumor. Postoperative histopathological 
examination resulted in a well-differentiated intrathecal neuroendocrine tumor 
(carcinoid) of the terminal filum. Postoperative staging showed no pathological 
abnormalities and no tumor recurrence after 6 months. Even though rare, 
carcinoids should be considered as differential diagnosis of tumors occurring in 
the CNS.

Congenital absence of lumbosacral articular facet joint associated with 
conjoined nerve root: a case report.

Tokushima Graduate School, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.

We report a rare case of congenital absence of the L5-S1 facet joint, which was 
associated with a conjoined nerve root. Combination of these two anomalies has 
been quite rarely reported in the literature. A 39-year-old man presented with 
acute low back pain and right leg radiating pain. Muscle weakness and sensory 
disturbance of the right leg were also apparent in the region innervated by L5 
and S1 nerve roots. Preoperative multidetector three-dimensional computed 
tomography (3D-CT) showed complete absence of the right S1 superior articular 
process. Magnetic resonance (MR) images showed lumbar disc herniation at right 
L5-S1 level that migrated cranially. Intraoperative findings revealed that the 
right L5 nerve root and S1 nerve root were conjoined, and the conjoined nerve 
root was compressed by L5-S1 disc herniation, which led to impairment of the 
conjoined nerve root by a single-level lumbar disc herniation. After removal of 
the disc herniation, his right leg pain immediately subsided, however muscle 
weakness and sensory disturbance persisted. Surgeons should be aware of this 
nerve root anomaly when examining a patient who shows an unusual clinical 
presentation and/or congenital osseous anomaly.

A case of lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas diagnosed by typical 
imaging.

Ishigami K, Yasukouchi Y, Nakamura K, Ito T, Takayanagi R.

Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.

CONTEXT: Lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas is an extremely rare 
disease, and is characterized by the replacement of pancreatic acinar cells with 
adipose tissue, although the pancreatic duct and islets are preserved.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 64-year-old female who was undergoing 
treatment for Hashimoto's disease at a nearby clinic. For the previous two 
years, she had experienced an unpleasant feeling in the upper abdominal area 
after eating oily foods. For the previous six months, she had also suffered from 
lower-back pain, and presented at our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography 
and magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked fat replacement over the entire 
pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed no anatomical 
abnormality or narrowing of the main pancreatic duct; the main pancreatic duct 
was normal up to the pancreatic tail and the branches of the pancreatic duct did 
not show any abnormalities. While the serum levels of the pancreatic enzymes 
were considerably low, according to the data of the pancreatic exocrine function 
test (N-benzoyl-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid test), endocrine function was 
maintained. On the basis of the abovementioned findings, we diagnosed lipomatous 
pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas.
CONCLUSIONS: Lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas is a very rare disease 
characterized by the disappearance of pancreatic exocrine tissue due to adipose 
tissue replacement, although the pancreatic duct and islets remain intact. Even 
though it has been suggested that the diagnosis of lipomatous pseudohypertrophy 
of the pancreas should be based on histological findings, this case indicated 
the possibility that lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas may be 
diagnosed solely by typical imaging findings and serological data.

Correlation between clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging findings in 
lumbar disc prolapse.

Janardhana AP(1), Rajagopal, Rao S, Kamath A.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, 
Manipal, India.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc prolapse is one of the common causes of low back pain 
seen in the working population. There are contradictorty reports regarding the 
clinical significance of various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings 
observed in these patients. The study was conducted to correlate the 
abnormalities observed on MRI and clinical features of lumbar disc prolapse.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 119 clinically diagnosed patients with lumbar disc 
prolapse were included in the study. Clinical evaluation included pain 
distribution, neurological symptoms and signs. MR evaluation included grades of 
disc degeneration, type of herniation, neural foramen compromise, nerve root 
compression, and miscellaneous findings. These MRI findings were tested for 
inter- and intraobserver variability. The MRI findings were then correlated with 
clinical symptoms and the level of disc prolapse as well as neurological signs 
and symptoms. Statistical analysis included the Kappa coefficient, Odd's ratio, 
and logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: There were no significant inter- or intraobserver variations for most 
of MRI findings (Kappa value more than 0.5) except for type of disc herniation 
which showed a interobserver variation of 0.46 (Kappa value). The clinical level 
of pain distribution correlated well with the MRI level (Kappa 0.8), but not all 
disc bulges produced symptoms. Central bulges and disc protrusions with thecal 
sac compression were mostly asymptomatic, while centrolateral protrusions and 
extrusions with neural foramen compromise correlated well with the dermatomal 
distribution of pain. Root compression observed in MRI did not produce 
neurological symptoms or deficits in all patients but when deficits were 
present, they correlated well with the presence of root compression in MRI. 
Multiple level disc herniations with foramen compromise were strongly associated 
with the presence of neurological signs.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of centrolateral protrusion or extrusion with gross 
foramen compromise correlates with clinical signs and symptoms very well, while 
central bulges and disc protrusions correlate poorly with clinical signs and 
symptoms. The presence of neural foramen compromise is more important in 
determining the clinical signs and symptoms while type of disc herniation 
(bulge, protrusion, or extrusion) correlates poorly with clinical signs and 
symptoms.

Morphometric analysis and identification of characteristic features in sacra 
bearing accessory articulations with L5 vertebrae.

Mahato NK(1).

Bhawrasala, Indore, Madhya Pradesh 452 010, India.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Occurrence of transitional vertebrae at the lumbosacral 
junction, especially accessory lumbosacral articulations (partial sacralization 
of the L5 vertebrae), is not uncommon. These transitional states are frequently 
associated with low back pain situations requiring surgical intervention.
PURPOSE: The study aimed to investigate the presence of distinct morphological 
features and structural peculiarities associated with these sacra. The features 
related to sacra bearing L5-S1 transitions might be significantly different from 
those of the normal sacra. This study tries to understand whether accessory 
L5-S1 articulations demonstrate altered mechanisms of load transfer as a result 
of structural changes at the L5-S1 junction.
STUDY DESIGN: Morphometric measurements of several linear dimensions and 
articular areas were obtained from 332 sacra. Thirty sacra demonstrated 
unilateral accessory facets on their ala. Twelve sacra showed bilateral 
accessory lumbosacral articulations. Indices were calculated based on the linear 
dimensions and on the surface areas of the bones to detect proportional 
contributions of the dimensions and surface areas to the overall structure of 
all the sacra.
OUTCOME MEASURES: All the parameters obtained from the transitional sacra were 
compared with the same parameters worked out on 290 normal sacra. All parameters 
in the sacra bearing accessory articulations were statistically compared with 
parameters in the normal sacra.
METHOD: Seven linear dimensions and five surface areas were measured in 290 
normal sacra. Thirty sacra bearing unilateral accessory articular facets and 12 
sacra with bilateral accessory facets on their alae were measured for the same 
linear parameters and surface areas. Nine indices were calculated from these 
measurements in both the normal and transitional sacra and statistically 
verified.
RESULTS: Analysis of the results indicated that sacra bearing accessory 
articulations, in comparison to the normal, carried their auricular surfaces at 
a higher level; possessed load bearing features mainly confined to the two upper 
sacral segments; showed lesser distances between the facet joints; showed 
smaller distance of the coronal plane of the facet joints from the posterior 
aspect of the S1 vertebral body; exhibited smaller and more coronally oriented 
facet joint surfaces; and exhibited smaller body width and height. The auricular 
surface area and superior surface of the body of S1 in these "transitional" 
sacra were similar in comparison to normal sacra. Linear dimensions in sacra 
with bilateral accessory articulations were smaller than the ones having 
unilateral accessory L5-S1 articulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Lumbosacral accessory articulations constituted the bulk of 
transitional variations at the junction. Accessory articulations were unilateral 
(9%) and bilateral (3%) with a total of 12% of all studied samples (n=332) 
demonstrating this type L5-S1 transition. Sacra with lumbosacral 
pseudoarticulations were associated with different anatomical features in 
contrast to normal sacra. Analysis of these structural differences with the 
normal variants may possibly help in understanding the biomechanical properties 
at these transitional sites. Evaluation of the relative proportions of 
dimensions within these bones may help plan surgical interventions or probably 
predict the pattern of abnormal weight bearing in these sacra.

Ochronosis is a rare genetic metabolic disorder resulting from a constitutional 
lack of homogentisic acid oxidase and subsequent accumulation of its substrate 
causing destruction of connective tissues with various systemic abnormalities. 
Typical musculoskeletal symptoms are arthropathy and low back pain and 
stiffness. Arthropathy primarily affects knee and hip joints, but shoulders are 
less frequently involved. We describe a case of ochronosis initially presented 
as acute bilateral shoulder pain. Review of literature with respect to the 
etiology, natural course of the disease, differential diagnosis and management 
was made.

A source of bleeding is often not evident during the evaluation of patients with 
superficial siderosis of the CNS despite extensive imaging. An intraspinal 
fluid-filled collection of variable dimensions is frequently observed on spine 
MR imaging in patients with idiopathic superficial siderosis. A similar finding 
has also been reported in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypotension. The 
authors report on a patient with superficial siderosis and a longitudinally 
extensive intraspinal fluid-filled collection secondary to a dural tear. The 
patient had a history of low-pressure headaches. His spine MR imaging and spine 
CT suggested the possibility of an underlying vascular malformation, but none 
was found on angiography. Repair of the dural tear resulted in resolution of the 
intraspinal fluid collection and CSF abnormalities. The significance of the 
association between superficial siderosis and idiopathic intracranial 
hypotension, and potential therapeutic and pathophysiological implications, are 
the subject of this report.

INTRODUCTION: Camptocormia refers to an abnormal posture with flexion of the 
thoraco-lumbar spine which increases during walking and resolves in supine 
position. This symptom is an increasingly recognized feature of parkinsonian and 
dystonic disorders, but may also be caused by neuromuscular diseases. There is 
recent evidence that both central and peripheral mechanisms may be involved in 
the pathogenesis of camptocormia. We report a case of acute onset of 
camptocormia, a rare side effect induced by olanzapine, a second-generation 
atypical anti-psychotic drug with fewer extra-pyramidal side-effects, 
increasingly used as first line therapy for schizophrenia, delusional disorders 
and bipolar disorder.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old Caucasian woman with no history of 
neuromuscular disorder, treated for chronic delusional disorder for the last ten 
years, received two injections of long-acting haloperidol. She was then referred 
for fatigue. Physical examination showed a frank parkinsonism without other 
abnormalities. Routine laboratory tests showed normal results, notably 
concerning creatine kinase level. Fatigue was attributed to haloperidol which 
was substituted for olanzapine. Our patient left the hospital after five days 
without complaint. She was admitted again three days later with acute back pain. 
Examination showed camptocormia and tenderness in paraspinal muscles. Creatine 
kinase level was elevated (2986 UI/L). Magnetic resonance imaging showed 
necrosis and edema in paraspinal muscles. Olanzapine was discontinued. Pain 
resolved quickly and muscle enzymes were normalized within ten days. Risperidone 
was later introduced without significant side-effect. The camptocormic posture 
had disappeared when the patient was seen as an out-patient one year later.
CONCLUSIONS: Camptocormia is a heterogeneous syndrome of various causes. We 
believe that our case illustrates the need to search for paraspinal muscle 
damage, including drug-induced rhabdomyolysis, in patients presenting with 
acute-onset bent spine syndrome. Although rare, the occurrence of camptocormia 
induced by olanzapine must be considered.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship of morphologically defined lumbar disc 
abnormalities with quantitative T2 mapping.
METHODS: Fifty-three patients, mean age 39 years, with low back pain were 
examined by MRI at 3 T (sagittal T1-fast spin echo (FSE), three-plane T2-FSE for 
morphological MRI, multi-echo spin echo for T2 mapping). All discs were 
classified morphologically. Regions of interest (ROIs) for the annulus were 
drawn. The space in between was defined as the nucleus pulposus (NP). To 
evaluate differences between the classified groups, univariate ANOVA with post 
hoc Games-Howell and paired two-tailed t tests were used.
RESULTS: In 265 discs we found 39 focal herniations, 10 annular tears, 123 
bulging discs and 103 "normal discs". T2 values of the NP between discs with 
annular tear and all other groups were statistically significantly different 
(all p ≤ 0.01). Discs with annular tears showed markedly lower NP T2 values than 
discs without. The difference in NP T2 values between discs with focal 
herniation and normal discs (p = 0.005) was statistically significant. There was 
no difference in NP T2 values between bulging and herniated discs (p = 0.11)
CONCLUSION: Quantitative T2 mapping of the nucleus pulposus of the 
intervertebral disc in the lumbar spine at 3 T reveals significant differences 
in discs with herniation and annular tears compared with discs without these 
abnormalities.

nick.sheehan@pbh-tr.nhs.uk

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred investigation for most spinal 
diseases and is increasingly requested for people with low back pain (LBP). 
However, determining the cause of back pain is complicated as it is often 
multifactorial and anatomical abnormalities are common in the spine and may not 
necessarily translate into clinical symptoms. Thus, national guidelines 
discourage the use of MRI in non-specific LBP and recommend reserving it for the 
investigation of severe or progressive neurological deficits or for those cases 
in which serious underlying pathology is suspected. It also has an acknowledged 
role in planning surgical management in cases of radiculopathy and spinal 
stenosis. This review summarises the indications for MRI in LBP and calls for 
improved education of patients and health professionals in the limitations of 
this investigation.

(1)Orthopedics Department, ChangZheng Hospital, ShangHai, China.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a severe complication of 
lumbar spinal disorders; it results from compression of the nerve roots of the 
cauda equina. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness 
of a classification scheme of CES based on factors including clinical symptoms, 
imaging signs, and electrophysiological findings.
METHODS: The records of 39 patients with CES were divided into 4 groups based on 
clinical features as follows. Group 1 (preclinical): low back pain with only 
bulbocavernosus reflex and ischiocavernosus reflex abnormalities. Group 2 
(early): saddle sensory disturbance and bilateral sciatica. Group 3 (middle): 
saddle sensory disturbance, bowel or bladder dysfunction, motor weakness of the 
lower extremity, and reduced sexual function. Group 4 (late): absence of saddle 
sensation and sexual function in addition to uncontrolled bowel function. The 
outcome including radiographic and electrophysiological findings was compared 
between groups.
RESULTS: The main clinical manifestations of CES included bilateral saddle 
sensory disturbance, and bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. The clinical 
symptoms of patients with multiple-segment canal stenosis identified 
radiographically were more severe than those of patients with single-segment 
stenosis. BCR and ICR improved in groups 1 and 2 after surgery, but no change 
was noted for groups 3 and 4.
INTERPRETATION: We conclude that bilateral radiculopathy or sciatica are early 
stages of CES and indicate a high risk of development of advanced CES. 
Electrophysiological abnormalities and reduced saddle sensation are indices of 
early diagnosis. Patients at the preclinical and early stages have better 
functional recovery than patients in later stages after surgical decompression.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the relationship among facet 
orientation, kinematics of a spinal unit, and change in lumbar spine canal 
diameter by using kinetic magnetic resonance imaging.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Some studies have suggested an association between 
increased sagittally oriented facet angles and degenerative lumbar 
spondylolisthesis. However, no study has specifically addressed the association 
of facet orientation with the kinematics of a spinal unit and change in canal 
diameter.
METHODS: Kinetic magnetic resonance imagings were performed with patients in 
flexion, neutral, and extension positions. Study subjects were classified into 6 
groups-AA, BB, CC, AB (BA), BC (CB), and AC (CA)-on the basis of bilateral facet 
angles (A, narrow; B, normal; and C, wide) and disc and facet joint 
degeneration. A magnetic resonance imaging analyzer was used for anatomic 
measurements and for calculating changes in canal diameters and disc bulging as 
well as the lumbar spine kinematics.
RESULTS: Osseous canal diameters were significantly smaller in the group AA than 
in the group BB, whereas they were significantly larger in the group CC than in 
the group BB. Canal diameter at the disc level was significantly smaller in the 
group AA than in the group BB in all 3 positions, whereas it was significantly 
larger in the group CC than in the group BB. Translational motion was 
significantly more in the group AA than in the group BB, whereas it was 
significantly lesser in the group CC than in the group BB.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the relationship among facet orientation, osseous 
canal diameter, kinematics of a spinal unit, and change in lumbar spine canal 
diameter. Patients with sagittally oriented facets had narrow osseous canals 
with mobility, whereas those with coronally oriented facets had stable and wider 
osseous canals. This finding is helpful in understanding the mechanism 
underlying lumbar spinal canal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Complete sacralization of L5 vertebrae: traits, dimensions, and load bearing in 
the involved sacra.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spines with sacralized fifth lumbar vertebrae are quite 
commonly encountered. Sacralizations represent a transitional state at 
lumbosacral junctions and are more susceptible to degenerative changes resulting 
from the altered load-bearing patterns at these regions.
PURPOSE: The present study is an attempt to analyze the morphology of sacra with 
complete and partially fused (sacralized) L5 vertebrae and compare it with those 
observed in normal sacra.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Measurements of dimensions and articular surface areas 
were recorded in samples bearing sacralized L5 vertebrae and in normal sacra. 
Relative contributions of dimensions and surface areas on the bone were worked 
out by calculating indices. Comparison with the normal sacra was expected to 
yield significant differences.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Means of all linear parameters and indices were compared 
between sacralized and normal samples and between the fused and unfused sides of 
unilaterally sacralized specimens. Unpaired Student t test was applied to assess 
the differences in the values.
METHODS: Seven linear dimensions and five surface areas were measured in 330 
sacra. Nine indices were formulated from them. Sixteen (4.8%) sacra presented 
with bilateral completely fused L5 vertebrae with the first sacral segments. 
Four (1.2%) showed unilateral complete unification of sacra with the transverse 
process of the L5 vertebra above. Parameters were compared between the normal 
and sacralized samples and also between the two varieties of sacralized 
specimen.
RESULTS: Sacra with fused L5 possessed significantly smaller heights than the 
normal ones if the fused L5 vertebra was excluded from the measurements. On 
inclusion of the L5, these sacra presented a grossly reduced distance between 
the zygapophyseal facets, a greater distance of the coronal plane of the facet 
joints from the posterior aspect of the L5, a narrower interauricular distance, 
slightly increased body width at the top of the sacrum (now L5), a comparable 
auricular surface area (with inclusion of the fusion of L5 transverse process at 
the lateral mass) to the normal ones, attenuated facet area, and occasionally, 
small intervertebral space between L5 and S1. The unilaterally fused variety 
exhibited overall smaller dimensions. None of these sacra showed accessory 
articulations at their ala. The auricular surfaces in these sacra spanned from 
mid-L5 to mid-S2 segments. The fusion of L5 increased the sacral height, width, 
and auricular surface. The auricular surfaces appeared to be situated "low-down" 
in context of the six (including L5) sacral segments.
CONCLUSIONS: Sacralization of L5 vertebra entails morphological alterations in 
the sacrum. The remnants of the original sacra in these specimens presented 
grossly diminished parameters. Sacralization of L5 possibly represents a 
structural and biomechanical adjustment to compensate for reduced joint 
interfaces associated with smaller sacra. It may correspond to one end of the 
transitional "spectrum," the other end being defined by lumbarization of the S1 
sacral segment.

Early-onset progressive osteoarthritis with hereditary progressive ophtalmopathy 
or Stickler syndrome.

Stickler syndrome is a group of rare genetic conditions (incidence, 1/7500 
births) related to mutations in the collagen genes. Both the mutations and the 
clinical features vary widely across affected patients. The main manifestations 
are craniofacial birth defects, bone and joint symptoms, ocular abnormalities, 
and hearing loss. Stickler syndrome may be revealed at birth (25% of cases) by a 
combination of cleft palate, retrognathism, and micrognathism known as Pierre 
Robin sequence, which may cause neonatal respiratory problems. The ocular 
abnormalities include severe myopia, abnormalities of the vitreous, and a high 
risk of retinal detachment (60% of cases), which may cause blindness (4% of 
cases). Severe hearing loss with onset in early childhood may impair performance 
at school. Osteoarthritis (75% of patients) with onset before 30 years of age is 
a severe manifestation that causes chronic hip and low back pain and functional 
impairments. Joint replacement surgery is often required. The risk associated 
with multiple anesthesias is highest in patients with craniofacial defects. The 
bone status may deserve to be evaluated, as the combination of genetic 
abnormalities and physical impairments may promote bone loss. Clinicians should 
be cognizant of Stickler syndrome so that they can detect the disease in 
patients and their family members, prevent functional impairments, organize a 
multidisciplinary management strategy, and arrange for genetic counseling.

Measurement of the normal lumbar intervertebral disc space using magnetic 
resonance imaging.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital, 
Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, Cheonan, Korea.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study.
PURPOSE: We wanted to measure the distance of the normal intervetebral disc 
space of Koreans. OVERVIEW OF THE LITERATURE: For judging the distance of the 
normal intervertebral disc space of Koreans, we studied young adults who didn't 
have degenerative spinal change to determine the distance of the normal 
intervertebral disc space of each lumbar vertebral segment, and we did so by 
performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: We studied a total of 178 outpatients who had low back pain and they 
underwent lumbar MRI. There were 138 males and 40 females, and their average age 
was 20.7 years (range, 15 to 25 years). On MRI, the segments with observed Modic 
change or other abnormalities were excluded from this investigation. To 
improvement the accuracy of measurement, two spine specialists measured the 
distances 2 times, and we calculated the mean value. We used paired t-tests for 
statistical analysis.
RESULTS: In the total 178 patients, the average distance of intervertebral space 
from the 1st to the 2nd lumbar vertebrae was 24.83% (range, 18 to 32%), that 
from the 2nd to the 3rd was 26.92% (range, 19 to 40%), that from the 3rd to 4th 
was 28.88% (range, 19 to 41%), that from the 4th to 5th was 29.60% (range, 21 to 
43%) and that from the 5th lumbar vertebra to the 1st sacrum was 27.52% (range, 
19 to 38%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we expect that knowing the normal distance of the 
lumbar intervertebral space of Koreans can be helpful for surgical 
reconstruction to treat many lumbar spine diseases, to predict the appropriate 
size of the devices inserted in the intervertebral space and to produce proper 
devices for Koreans.

Inflammatory and degenerative sacroiliac joint disease in a primary back pain 
cohort.

O'Shea FD(1), Boyle E, Salonen DC, Ammendolia C, Peterson C, Hsu W, Inman RD.

Author information:
(1)Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of sacroiliac (SI) joint abnormalities in a primary 
low back pain population remains unresolved. The aims of our study were to 
define the prevalence of SI joint disease in this cohort, and to identify 
clinical features that might accurately predict radiographic changes in the SI 
joint and spine.
METHODS: Lumbar spine and anteroposterior pelvis radiographs taken over a 3-year 
period for the evaluation of back pain at a major chiropractic college were 
scored for the presence of inflammatory or degenerative features. Data were 
subsequently extracted by means of a predetermined template from the clinical 
notes. The outcomes were correlated using Spearman's correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: We identified 315 patients (173 men, 142 women), ages 18-60 years. Of 
these, 100 patients (31.7%) demonstrated SI joint abnormalities: 75 (23.8%) 
degenerative, 25 (7.9%) inflammatory. Sex was strongly associated with type of 
SI joint pathology; degenerative disease was predominantly found in women (68%), 
whereas inflammatory disease was predominantly found in men (63%). In women 
there was no correlation between degenerative SI joint abnormalities and 
degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Of the clinical descriptors evaluated, 
none were associated with the radiographic findings with the exception of 
buttock pain, which was associated with inflammatory sacroiliitis. Neither being 
overweight nor pregnancy history was associated with degenerative changes in the 
SI joint.
CONCLUSION: In a primary back pain cohort, degenerative SI joint disease may be 
an under-recognized clinical entity. It is strongly influenced by sex but is 
unrelated to degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Currently proposed 
clinical discriminators performed poorly in correlating with radiographic 
changes in the SI joint.

[CNS processing of pain in functional somatic syndromes].

[Article in German]

Petzke F(1).

Uniklinik Köln, Lindenthal, 50924, Köln, Deutschland. Frank.Petzke@uk-koeln.de

Functional pain syndromes usually are characterized by a local or generalized 
increase in pain sensitivity, spontaneous ongoing pain, and a variety of other 
common symptoms. Classification or definition of a syndrome is usually somewhat 
arbitrarily based on the predominantly affected body region or a main symptom, 
resulting in significant overlap between conditions. Support for the involvement 
of the central nervous system (CNS) comes from the frequent comorbidity of 
affective disorders and symptomatology, disturbances in cognitive function, 
changes in neuroendocrine function, and dysregulation of the autonomic nervous 
system, although only subgroups of patients are affected. Findings of 
neuroimaging studies in functional pain syndromes typically reveal plausible 
correlates for the patients' subjective complaints and indicate a central 
augmentation in pain processing but also in other sensory systems including a 
postulated interoceptive system. The pathophysiology of this augmentation is not 
clear, and the importance of peripheral input remains unresolved, as well as the 
contribution of spinal and supraspinal mechanisms. Affective and cognitive 
factors clearly influence pain processing in these syndromes, but do not fully 
explain the observed augmentation. For FMS, chronic low back pain, and irritable 
bowel syndrome a dysfunction of the descending inhibitory systems is supported 
by these findings. However, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the 
causality of the reported associations and to establish a primary role of the 
CNS in these syndromes. Current techniques like VBM and H-MRS have revealed 
potential yet highly variable structural abnormalities of the CNS in several of 
the syndromes, but clinical relevance and conclusions from these studies remain 
far from clear. New theoretical concepts should drive prospective and 
interdisciplinary research based on well-defined hypotheses to use the full 
potential of the current neuroimaging techniques.

(1)From the Departments of *Orthopaedics and †Radiology, Sahlgrenska University 
Hospital, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.

STUDY DESIGN: A case report.
OBJECTIVE: To present a previously not described rare case of intradiscal 
hematoma due to acute trauma in an elite tennis player.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several studies have demonstrated a high frequency 
of radiological changes in the spine of athletes, especially in sports with high 
loads on the back. Signs of disc degeneration without disc herniation have 
frequently been found in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the spine 
of athletes. It has also been shown that radiological abnormalities of the spine 
in young athletes are correlated to back pain.
METHODS: An elite male tennis player experienced pain in the right buttock after 
a backhand stroke. He was successfully treated for hip problems and started to 
play competitive tennis, 2 weeks later. After few games, a backhand stroke again 
resulted in intense pain projected in the os coccyx region. At examination, 
there were no neurologic disturbances. At palpation over the spinal processes 
(Springing test) of L1-L2, the patient experienced intense pain projected to the 
os coccyx region.
RESULTS: MRI examination showed an injured L1-L2 disc with fluid inside the disc 
with a signal similar to blood. Four additional MRI examinations were performed 
2 weeks and 2 years after the injury until disc degeneration is formed. 
Radiograph examination before and 2 years after the injury is available.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, trauma in athletes can cause intradiscal hematoma, 
which probably is a new etiology for disc degeneration. Also that sudden onset 
of pain in the hip or the gluteal region may be caused by referred pain due to a 
disc lesion. Intradiscal hematoma can be visualized using MRI.

The relationship of Modic change to pain and inflammation remains to be unclear. 
Recently, some authors have reported that Modic type 1 signals are closely 
related to infection. However, if the patients do not have severe back pain, 
fever, or an abnormal blood profile, it is difficult to distinguish between 
common Modic change and infection. The purpose of this study was to examine the 
prevalence of pyogenic spondylitis in patients who showed Modic type 1 change 
without other signs of infection. Seventy-one patients with Modic type 1 change 
were evaluated (average age 55, 32 males and 39 females). X-ray and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to investigate low-back pain and leg 
pain. Body temperature was measured and blood analysis (including white blood 
cell count and level of C-reactive protein) was conducted for all patents. All 
71 patients with Modic type 1 change, but without other signs of infection were 
followed for 2 years. Low-back pain, X-ray, and blood analyses were performed 
every 3 months; and MRI was performed every year. Severe low-back pain or 
abnormal signs developed in four patients during the follow-up. Pyogenic 
spondylitis was diagnosed in three patients by symptoms, blood results, and 
imaging, and confirmed by biopsy. Two of the three patients were diabetic. A 
total of 4.2% of patients with Modic type 1 change, but without other signs of 
infection were diagnosed as having pyogenic spondylitis during the 2-year 
follow-up, therefore, it is important to consider this before treating Modic 
type 1 change.

A 37-year-old man with the chief complaints of lumbago and fever is presented. 
Laboratory data showed the extreme elevation of alfa feto-protein (AFP), human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and lactate dehydorgenase (LDH). Computed 
tomography (CT) scan revealed a huge retroperitoneal tumor with multiple 
pulmonary nodules as well as left supraclavicular and left axillary lymph nodes 
enlargement. Although he was suspected the testicular tumor with metastasis, he 
had no testicular abnormalities including tumor and microlithiasis. Therefore, 
he was diagnosed as a retroperitoneal extra-gonadal germ cell tumor, which had 
poor prognosis because of multiple metastasis and the tremendous increase of 
hCG. Although he was treated with three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and 
cisplatin (BEP), he achieved partial response and no normalization of tumor 
markers. After three cycles of BEP, he was treated with four cycles of 
paclitaxel and ifosfamide plus cisplatin (TIP) immediately. During chemotherapy, 
he was treated with his peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) as 
well. After the completion of two regimens' chemotherapies, all his tumor 
markers returned to be normal. However, retroperitoneal tumor, left 
supraclavicular and axillary lymphnodes still remained. He underwent three 
operations including retroperitoneal lymphnode dissection with nephrectomy, left 
supraclavicular and axillary lymphnodes removal, respectively. All specimens had 
no viable cells, histologically, The patient has been quite well and free of 
disease for 24 months. It is concluded that even if far-advanced germ cell tumor 
is discovered, a more promising prognosis could be expected with intensive and 
aggressive treatment such as our case.

This article overviews electrodiagnostic tests that provide evidence-based data 
in the treatment and management of abnormalities in nerves and muscles. There is 
a focused review on cardiac tests, nerve-conduction tests, low-back pain tests, 
seizure and epilepsy tests, and obstructive sleep apnea electrodiagnostic tests. 
Case reports demonstrate how these electrophysiologic tests can provide specific 
data about the location and underlying causative factors of abnormalities in the 
nerves and muscles that routine diagnostic tests cannot differentiate.

Depression is common in whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). Our objectives were 
to identify factors associated with depressive symptomatology occurring in the 
initial stages of WAD, and to identify factors predicting the course of 
depressive symptoms. A population-based cohort of adults sustaining 
traffic-related WAD was followed at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Baseline 
measures (assessed a median of 11 days post-crash) included demographic and 
collision-related factors, prior health, and initial post-crash pain and 
symptoms. Depressive symptomatology was assessed at baseline and at each 
follow-up using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). 
We included only those who participated at all follow-ups (n = 3,452; 59% of 
eligible participants). Using logistic regression, we identified factors 
associated with initial (post-crash) depression. Using multinomial regression, 
we identified baseline factors predicting course of depression. Courses of 
depression were no depression; initial depression that resolves, recurs or 
persists, and later onset depression. Factors associated with initial depression 
included greater neck and low back pain severity, greater percentage of body in 
pain, numbness/tingling in arms/hand, dizziness, vision problems, post-crash 
anxiety, fracture, prior mental health problems, and poorer general health. 
Predictors of persistent depression included older age, greater initial neck and 
low back pain, post-crash dizziness, vision and hearing problems, 
numbness/tingling in arms/hands, anxiety, prior mental health problems, and 
poorer general health. Recognition of these underlying risk factors may assist 
health care providers to predict the course of psychological reactions and to 
provide effective interventions.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based treatment is not effective for all patients. Research 
must therefore be carried out to help clinicians to decide for whom and under 
what circumstances certain treatment is effective. Treatment theory can assist 
in designing research that will provide results on which clinical 
decision-making can be based.
OBJECTIVE: To illustrate how treatment theory can be helpful in the design of 
explanatory trials that assist clinical decision-making.
METHODS: The benefit of treatment theory was demonstrated by approaching the 
design of a clinical trial from two perspectives: one without the use of 
treatment theory and one with the explicit use of treatment theory. Evaluation 
of the effectiveness of cognitive treatment of illness perceptions for patients 
with chronic low back pain was used as an illustrative example.
ISSUES: With treatment theory as the main focus, the intervention became the 
starting point for the design of an explanatory trial. Potentially relevant 
patient selection criteria, essential treatment components, the optimal choice 
of a control group and the selection of outcome measures were specified.
CONCLUSION: This paper not only describes problems encountered in research on 
the effectiveness of treatment, but also ways in which to address these 
problems.

Currently, there are over 300,000 lumbar discectomies performed in the US 
annually without an objective standard for patient selection. A prospective 
clinical outcome study of 200 cases with 5-year follow-up was used to develop 
and validate an MRI-based classification scheme to eliminate as much ambiguity 
as possible. 100 consecutive lumbar microdiscectomies were performed between 
1992 and 1995 based on the criteria for "substantial" herniation on MRI. This 
series was used to develop the MSU Classification as an objective measure of 
lumbar disc herniation on MRI to define "substantial". It simply classifies 
herniation size as 1-2-3 and location as A-B-C, with inter-examiner reliability 
of 98%. A second prospective series of 100 discectomies was performed between 
2000 and 2002, based on the new criteria, to validate this classification 
scheme. All patients with size-1 lesions were electively excluded from surgical 
consideration in our study. The Oswestry Disability Index from both series was 
better than most published outcome norms for lumbar microdiscectomy. The two 
series reported 96 and 90% good to excellent outcomes, respectively, at 1 year, 
and 84 and 80% at 5 years. The most frequent types of herniation selected for 
surgery in each series were types 2-B and 2-AB, suggesting the combined 
importance of both size and location. The MSU Classification is a simple and 
reliable method to objectively measure herniated lumbar disc. When used in 
correlation with appropriate clinical findings, the MSU Classification can 
provide objective criteria for surgery that may lead to a higher percentage of 
good to excellent outcomes.

The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of opioid 
administration on the acute cardiorespiratory and muscle oxygenation responses 
during a repetitive lifting and lowering test (RLL) to voluntary fatigue in 
participants with chronic low back pain (LBP). Written informed consent was 
obtained from 27 LBP participants (mean age 50.9 +/- 16.4 years) who completed 
one testing session during which they were administered a saline placebo and 
opioid (1 microg/kg of fentanyl intravenously) in random order. The participants 
performed the RLL at a rate that they felt that they could sustain for an 8-h 
working day. Acute opioid administration increased the total lifting time and 
total work done during RLL by 35 and 48%, respectively (p < 0.05). However, the 
increased work capacity was accompanied by a significant (p < 0.05) increase in 
oxygen cost of 22% per unit amount of work done and significant (p < 0.05) 
increases in heart rate (7%) and ventilation rate (10%). Near infrared 
spectroscopic analysis of erector spinae oxygenation and blood volume responses 
during RLL indicated no significant (p > 0.05) differences between the opioid 
and placebo phases. These findings suggest that the increased energy cost of 
lifting as a result of opioid administration was due to enhanced central oxygen 
transport and not peripheral muscle oxygen extraction.

Endovascular laser therapy for varicose veins: an evidence-based analysis.

Medical Advisory Secretariat.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the MAS evidence review was to conduct a systematic 
review of the available evidence on the safety, effectiveness, durability and 
cost-effectiveness of endovascular laser therapy (ELT) for the treatment of 
primary symptomatic varicose veins (VV).
BACKGROUND: The Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) met on 
November 27, 2009 to review the safety, effectiveness, durability and 
cost-effectiveness of ELT for the treatment of primary VV based on an 
evidence-based review by the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS). CLINICAL 
CONDITION: VV are tortuous, twisted, or elongated veins. This can be due to 
existing (inherited) valve dysfunction or decreased vein elasticity (primary 
venous reflux) or valve damage from prior thrombotic events (secondary venous 
reflux). The end result is pooling of blood in the veins, increased venous 
pressure and subsequent vein enlargement. As a result of high venous pressure, 
branch vessels balloon out leading to varicosities (varicose veins). SYMPTOMS 
TYPICALLY AFFECT THE LOWER EXTREMITIES AND INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO): 
aching, swelling, throbbing, night cramps, restless legs, leg fatigue, itching 
and burning. Left untreated, venous reflux tends to be progressive, often 
leading to chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). A NUMBER OF COMPLICATIONS ARE 
ASSOCIATED WITH UNTREATED VENOUS REFLUX: including superficial thrombophlebitis 
as well as variceal rupture and haemorrhage. CVI often results in chronic skin 
changes referred to as stasis dermatitis. Stasis dermatitis is comprised of a 
spectrum of cutaneous abnormalities including edema, hyperpigmentation, eczema, 
lipodermatosclerosis and stasis ulceration. Ulceration represents the disease 
end point for severe CVI. CVI is associated with a reduced quality of life 
particularly in relation to pain, physical function and mobility. In severe 
cases, VV with ulcers, QOL has been rated to be as bad or worse as other chronic 
diseases such as back pain and arthritis. Lower limb VV is a common disease 
affecting adults and estimated to be the seventh most common reason for 
physician referral in the US. There is a strong familial predisposition to VV 
with the risk in offspring being 90% if both parents affected, 20% when neither 
is affected, and 45% (25% boys, 62% girls) if one parent is affected. Globally, 
the prevalence of VV ranges from 5% to 15% among men and 3% to 29% among women 
varying by the age, gender and ethnicity of the study population, survey methods 
and disease definition and measurement. The annual incidence of VV estimated 
from the Framingham Study was reported to be 2.6% among women and 1.9% among men 
and did not vary within the age range (40-89 years) studied. Approximately 1% of 
the adult population has a stasis ulcer of venous origin at any one time with 4% 
at risk. The majority of leg ulcer patients are elderly with simple superficial 
vein reflux. Stasis ulcers are often lengthy medical problems and can last for 
several years and, despite effective compression therapy and multilayer 
bandaging are associated with high recurrence rates. Recent trials involving 
surgical treatment of superficial vein reflux have resulted in healing and 
significantly reduced recurrence rates. ENDOVASCULAR LASER THERAPY FOR VV: ELT 
is an image-guided, minimally invasive treatment alternative to surgical 
stripping of superficial venous reflux. It does not require an operating room or 
general anesthesia and has been performed in outpatient settings by a variety of 
medical specialties including surgeons (vascular or general), interventional 
radiologists and phlebologists. Rather than surgically removing the vein, ELT 
works by destroying, cauterizing or ablating the refluxing vein segment using 
heat energy delivered via laser fibre. Prior to ELT, colour-flow Doppler 
ultrasonography is used to confirm and map all areas of venous reflux to devise 
a safe and effective treatment plan. The ELT procedure involves the introduction 
of a guide wire into the target vein under ultrasound guidance followed by the 
insertion of an introducer sheath through which an optical fibre carrying the 
laser energy is advanced. A tumescent anesthetic solution is injected into the 
soft tissue surrounding the target vein along its entire length. This serves to 
anaesthetize the vein so that the patient feels no discomfort during the 
procedure. It also serves to insulate the heat from damaging adjacent 
structures, including nerves and skin. Once satisfactory positioning has been 
confirmed with ultrasound, the laser is activated. Both the laser fibre and the 
sheath are simultaneously, slowly and continuously pulled back along the length 
of the target vessel. At the end of the procedure, homeostasis is then achieved 
by applying pressure to the entry point. Adequate and proper compression 
stockings and bandages are applied after the procedure to reduce the risk of 
venous thromboembolism, and to reduce postoperative bruising and tenderness. 
Patients are encouraged to walk immediately after the procedure and most 
patients return to work or usual activity within a few days. Follow-up protocols 
vary, with most patients returning 1-3 weeks later for an initial follow-up 
visit. At this point, the initial clinical result is assessed and occlusion of 
the treated vessels is confirmed with ultrasound. Patients often have a second 
follow-up visit 1-3 months following ELT at which time clinical evaluation and 
ultrasound are repeated. If required, sclerotherapy may be performed during the 
ELT procedure or at any follow-up visits.
REGULATORY STATUS: Endovascular laser for the treatment of VV was approved by 
Health Canada as a class 3 device in 2002. The treatment has been an insured 
service in Saskatchewan since 2007 and is the only province to insure ELT. 
Although the treatment is not an insured service in Ontario, it has been 
provided by various medical specialties since 2002 in over 20 private clinics.
LITERATURE SEARCH: The MAS evidence-based review was performed as an update to 
the 2007 health technology review performed by the Australian Medical Services 
Committee (MSAC) to support public financing decisions. The literature search 
was performed on August 18, 2009 using standard bibliographic databases for 
studies published from January 1, 2007 to August 15, 2009. Search alerts were 
generated and reviewed for additional relevant literature up until October 1, 
2009.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: English language full-reports and human studiesOriginal 
reports with defined study methodologyReports including standardized 
measurements on outcome events such as technical success, safety, effectiveness, 
durability, quality of life or patient satisfactionReports involving ELT for VV 
(great or small saphenous veins)Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic 
reviews and meta-analysesCohort and controlled clinical studies involving > 1 
month ultrasound imaging follow-up
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Non systematic reviews, letters, comments and 
editorialsReports not involving outcome events such as safety, effectiveness, 
durability, or patient satisfaction following an intervention with ELTReports 
not involving interventions with ELT for VVPilot studies or studies with small 
samples ( < 50 subjects)
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The MAS evidence search identified 14 systematic reviews, 
29 cohort studies on safety and effectiveness, four cost studies and 12 
randomized controlled trials involving ELT, six of these comparing endovascular 
laser with surgical ligation and saphenous vein stripping. Since 2007, 22 cohort 
studies involving 10,883 patients undergoing ELT of the great saphenous vein 
(GSV) have been published. Imaging defined treatment effectiveness of mean vein 
closure rates were reported to be greater than 90% (range 93%- 99%) at short 
term follow-up. Longer than one year follow-up was reported in five studies with 
life table analysis performed in four but the follow up was still limited at 
three and four years. The overall pooled major adverse event rate, including 
DVT, PE, skin burns or nerve damage events extracted from these studies, was 
0.63% (69/10,883). The overall level of evidence of randomized trials comparing 
ELT with surgical ligation and vein stripping (n= 6) was graded as moderate to 
high. Recovery after treatment was significantly quicker after ELT (return to 
work median number of days, 4 vs. 17; p= .005). Major adverse events occurring 
after surgery were higher [(1.8% (n=4) vs. 0.4% (n = 1) 1 but not significantly. 
Treatment effectiveness as measured by imaging vein absence or closure, symptom 
relief or quality of life similar in the two treatment groups and both 
treatments resulted in statistically significantly improvements in these 
outcomes. Recurrence was low after both treatments at follow up but 
neovascularization (growth of new vessels, a key predictor of long term 
recurrence was significantly more common (18% vs. 1%; p = .001) after surgery. 
Although patient satisfaction was reported to be high (>80%) with both 
treatments, patient preferences evaluated through recruitment process, physician 
reports and consumer groups were strongly in favour of ELT. For patients minimal 
complications, quick recovery and dependability of outpatient scheduling were 
key considerations. As clinical effectiveness of the two treatments was similar, 
a cost-analysis was performed to compare differences in resources and costs 
between the two procedures. A budget impact analysis for introducing ELT as an 
insured service was also performed. The average case cost (based on Ontario 
hospital costs and medical resources) for surgical vein stripping was estimated 
to be $1,799. Because of the uncertainties with resources associated with ELT, 
in addition to the device related costs, hospital costs were varied and assumed 
to be the same as or less than (40%) those for surgery resulting in an average 
ELT case cost of $2,025 or $1,602. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

Depression is ranked as one of the strongest predictors for low back pain. This 
association is observed by multiple studies, with odds ratios increasing with 
intensity of back pain and severity of depression ;. In order to investigate the 
predictive power of baseline depression on the transition from acute to chronic 
pain (3 months post-acute back pain), a recent prospective study evaluated the 
direct and indirect effects of multiple parameters on chronic pain severity and 
disability . The model only accounted for 26% of the variance in chronic pain. 
Acute pain intensity did not directly predict pain three months later, and 
baseline pain beliefs failed to predict chronic pain magnitude. Despite these 
relatively weak relationships to chronic pain, the authors argued that their 
findings support the growing literature contending that progression to chronic 
pain is more dependent on psychosocial and occupational factors than on medical 
characteristics of the spinal condition. In general, a long series of studies 
now describe psychosocial and psychological factors in predicting functional and 
social disability, where the interrelationship between ratings of 
catastrophizing, pain-related fear of (re-) injury, depression, disability, and 
pain severity are studied and modeled in combination with demographics in 
various chronic pain conditions. Although these factors may be associated with 
pain in certain individuals, attempts to create models of CBP based upon them 
have been unproductive ;;;; for further details see . It is now being recognized 
that psychosocial factors constitute “non-negligible risks” for the development 
of low back pain and cannot account for how or why a patient transitions into 
the chronic pain state. We have examined cognitive and sensory properties of 
chronic pain patients, with the simple notion that living with chronic pain may 
impart a cost in such processing. A long list of cognitive abnormalities has 
been described in chronic pain patients. The most noteworthy are attentional and 
memory deficits ;. However, little effort has been placed in differentiating 
such deficits based on chronic pain type. We reported that, in contrast to 
matched healthy controls, CBP and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) patients 
are significantly impaired on an emotional decisionmaking task . Moreover, the 
performance of CBP patients was highly correlated with their verbal report of 
pain at the time of performing the task. In contrast to CBP, CRPS patients’ 
performance was not modified when their pain was manipulated using a sympathetic 
block. The latter implies that the brain mechanisms underlying the two types of 
chronic pain, or the impact of each condition on the brain, may be distinct and 
thus also distinctly modulate emotional states. It should be noted that the CRPS 
patients were tested on a long battery of other cognitive tasks as well, and 
their performance on these was not different from healthy control subjects. Two 
important conclusions are drawn from these observations. Firstly, cognitive 
disruption in chronic pain is specific to the type of test administered, 
implying impact on unique brain circuitry. Secondly, there are important 
differences between chronic pain conditions, even on the same cognitive task, 
suggesting that each condition may underlie unique brain 
activity/reorganization, which complicates our understanding of these conditions 
as it demands that we study each and every chronic pain regarding its cognitive 
and brain signature. More importantly, the implication that distinct chronic 
pain conditions have unique brain signatures open the possibility that each one 
of them may be understood in its own right, enabling the development of novel, 
specific therapies for each. This theme will be repeated several times below, 
emphasizing that brain-derived parameters repeatedly indicate the specific 
properties of distinct chronic pain conditions. It should be emphasized that the 
impact of chronic pain does not only result in deficits. When CBP patients were 
contrasted to healthy subjects as to gustatory abilities, we were able to show 
decreased threshold to gustatory detection and increased sensitivity to 
supra-threshold tastants for all modalities examined . Thus, these CBP patients 
are generally more sensitive in taste perception. It is possible that this 
ability is a predisposing factor. In fact, all the brain and cognitive changes 
we describe here are cross-sectional studies, and thus in all cases the 
distinction between predisposition and a consequence to chronic pain remains 
unsettled. More likely, increased taste sensitivity is a result of brain 
representation/reorganization as a consequence of living with CBP. We ascribe 
the deficit in emotional decision-making in CBP and CRPS as a consequence of the 
representation/reorganization of brain activity between the lateral and medial 
prefrontal cortex. In fact, our observation of activity in medial prefrontal 
cortex in CRPS was the initial impetus for testing chronic pain patients with 
the “gambling test.” We also think that the increased taste sensitivity is a 
direct result of changes in activity/connectivity of the insular cortex in CBP 
Our earlier observation that insular cortex activity increases in CBP patients 
in proportion to the number of years they are in chronic pain , and given that 
parts of the insular cortex are considered primary gustatory cortex, led us to 
the hypothesis that gestation may be different in CBP Therefore, the cognitive 
and sensory changes we have observed in chronic pain patients are derived from 
observations regarding cortical representation and reorganization, and thus 
these domains are complementary to each other, reinforcing the idea that the 
brain abnormalities do result in very specific changes in information 
processing.

Butterfly vertebra is an uncommon congenital spinal anomaly. Only a small number 
of cases with butterfly vertebra have thus far been reported in the 
literature.We herewith describe a 32-year-old male admitted to our clinic with 
low back pain. He has been suffering from low back pain since early adolescence. 
Radiologic investigations confirmed presence of butterfly vertebra at Lumbar(L)2 
level and L3-4, L4-5 posterior disc protrusion and slight osteoarthritic changes 
in lumbar spine which proved to be a coincidental finding along with nonspecific 
low back pain. Routine examination of the motor and sensory system was found to 
be normal. Hematologic evaluation was made to rule out pathologic causes of 
anterior wedging of the vertebra like infections and metastases in the spine. 
Butterfly vertebra anomaly is considered to be incidental and usually 
asymptomatic. Awareness of this anomaly is important for correct diagnosis, 
while its imaging features may be confused with traumatic compression fracture, 
or with a pathologic fracture. Also, this spinal anomaly may be associated with 
many syndromes. This taken into account, all the necessary investigations should 
be carried out for purposes of achieving a correct diagnosis.

Relatively few cases of trisomy 8 mosaicism syndrome (T8mS) are documented in 
the medical literature. It is a rare genetic condition characterized by extreme 
phenotypic variability--ranging from severe congenital malformations to minute 
dysmorphic changes. The authors describe a case of T8mS in a man aged 33 years 
who presented with lumbar spine herniated nucleus propulsus. This case features 
some of the classic characteristics of T8mS and suggests an association between 
T8mS and herniated disks.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred investigation for most spinal 
diseases and is increasingly requested for people with low back pain (LBP). 
However, determining the cause of back pain is complicated as it is often 
multifactorial and anatomical abnormalities are common in the spine and may not 
necessarily translate into clinical symptoms. Thus, national guidelines 
discourage the use of MRI in non-specific LBP and recommend reserving it for the 
investigation of severe or progressive neurological deficits or for those cases 
in which serious underlying pathology is suspected. It also has an acknowledged 
role in planning surgical management in cases of radiculopathy and spinal 
stenosis. This review summarises the indications for MRI in LBP and calls for 
improved education of patients and health professionals in the limitations of 
this investigation.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Although the role of radiographic abnormalities in the 
etiology of nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is unclear, the frequent 
identification of these features on radiologic studies continues to influence 
medical decision making.
PURPOSE: The primary purposes of the study were to evaluate the prevalence of 
lumbar spine degeneration features, evaluated on computed tomography (CT), in a 
community-based sample and to evaluate the association between lumbar spine 
degeneration features. The secondary purpose was to evaluate the association 
between spinal degeneration features and LBP.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional community-based study that was an 
ancillary project to the Framingham Heart Study.
SAMPLE: A subset of 187 participants were chosen from the 3,529 participants 
enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study who underwent multidetector CT scan to 
assess aortic calcification.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-report measures: LBP in the preceding 12 months was 
evaluated using a Nordic self-report questionnaire. Physiologic measures: 
Dichotomous variables indicating the presence of intervertebral disc narrowing, 
facet joint osteoarthritis (OA), spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, and spinal 
stenosis and the density (in Hounsfield units) of multifidus and erector spinae 
muscles were evaluated on CT.
METHODS: We calculated the prevalence of spinal degeneration features and mean 
density of multifidus and erector spinae muscles in groups of individuals with 
and without LBP. Using the chi(2) test for dichotomous and t test for continuous 
variables, we estimated the differences in spinal degeneration parameters 
between the aforementioned groups. To evaluate the association of spinal 
degeneration features with age, the prevalence of degeneration features was 
calculated in four age groups (less than 40, 40-50, 50-60, and 60+ years). We 
used multiple logistic regression models to examine the association between 
spinal degeneration features (before and after adjustment for age, sex, and body 
mass index [BMI]) and LBP, and between all degeneration features and LBP.
RESULTS: In total, 104 men and 83 women, with a mean age (+/-standard deviation) 
of 52.6+/-10.8 years, participated in the study. There was a high prevalence of 
intervertebral disc narrowing (63.9%), facet joint OA (64.5%), and spondylolysis 
(11.5%) in the studied sample. When all spinal degeneration features as well as 
age, sex, and BMI were factored in stepwise fashion into a multiple logistic 
regression model, only spinal stenosis showed statistically significant 
association with LBP, odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]): 3.45 
[1.12-10.68]. Significant association was found between facet joint OA and low 
density of multifidus (OR [95% CI]: 3.68 [1.36-9.97]) and erector spinae (OR 
[95% CI]: 2.80 [1.10-7.16]) muscles.
CONCLUSIONS: Degenerative features of the lumbar spine were extremely prevalent 
in this community-based sample. The only degenerative feature associated with 
self-reported LBP was spinal stenosis. Other degenerative features appear to be 
unassociated with LBP.

3-18-15, Kuramoto, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan. sairyokun@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: The main clinical symptom of lumbar spondylolysis is lower back 
pain. Radiculopathy rarely occurs without vertebral slippage. Hypothesis 
Spondylolysis in young athletes can cause lumbar radiculopathy.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
METHODS: Ten patients (7 males and 3 females) were included in this study. The 
age of the patients ranged from 12 to 27 years. We employed plain radiography, 
computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and selective radiculography if 
needed.
RESULTS: The pathomechanism was classified into nonspondylolytic radiculopathy 
(3 cases) and spondylolytic radiculopathy (7 cases). In the nonspondylolytic 
group, 1 patient had a juxta-facet cyst at L4-5 and 2 patients had a herniated 
nucleus pulposus. In the other group, spondylolytic-related factors caused 
radiculopathy, and spondylolysis was in the early or progressive stage in all 7 
patients. Radiologic findings indicated that radiculopathy was caused by 
extraosseous hematoma or edema in the vicinity of the fracture site. The 
radiculopathy disappeared within a month of nonoperative management, and 
radiologic abnormalities disappeared 3 to 6 months later.
CONCLUSION: Radiculopathy can occur together with lumbar spondylolysis without 
slippage in young athletes. We propose extra-osseous hematoma or edema at the 
site of spondylolysis as the unique pathomechanism causing radiculopathy in 
young athletes. Radiculopathy is rare in athletes with spondylolysis. Magnetic 
resonance imaging is a useful tool to clarify the pathologic changes that induce 
the radiculopathy for both spondylolytic and nonspondylolytic factors.

Making the AGREE tool more user-friendly: the feasibility of a user guide based 
on Boolean operators.

Scott NA(1), Moga C, Harstall C.

Author information:
(1)Health Technology Assessment Unit, Institute of Health Economics, Edmonton, 
AB, Canada.

Rationale, aims and objectives The Appraisal of Guidelines Research and 
Evaluation (AGREE) instrument is a generic tool for assessing guideline quality. 
This feasibility study aimed to reduce the ambiguity and subjectivity associated 
with AGREE item scoring, and to augment the tool's capacity to differentiate 
between good- and poor-quality guidelines. Methods A literature review was 
conducted to ascertain what AGREE instrument adjustments had been reported to 
date. The AGREE User Guide was then modified by: 1 constructing a detailed set 
of instructions, or dictionary, using Boolean operators, and 2 overlaying seven 
criteria to categorize guideline quality. The feasibility of the Boolean-based 
dictionary was tested by three appraisers using three randomly selected 
guidelines on low back pain management. The dictionary was then revised and 
re-tested. Results Of the 52 published studies identified, 14% had modified the 
instrument by adding or deleting items and 35% had adopted strategies, such as 
using a consensus approach, to overcome inconsistencies and ensure identical 
item scoring among appraisers. For the feasibility test, Pearson correlation 
coefficients ranged from 0.27 to 0.81. Revision and re-testing of the dictionary 
increased the level of agreement (range 0.41 to 0.94). Application of the 
revised dictionary not only decreased the variability of the domain scores, but 
also reduced the tool's reliability among inexperienced appraisers. Conclusion 
Appraisers found the Boolean-based AGREE User Guide easier to use than the 
original, which improved their confidence in the tool. Good reliability was 
achieved in the feasibility test, but the reliability and validity of some of 
the changes will require further evaluation.

Anterior sacral meningocoele is caused by a congenital hiatus in the anterior 
sacrum. We report a very rare case which presented as acute urinary retention. 
The common findings of anterior sacral meningocele include atypical low back 
pain, urological and gynaecological symptoms. Acute urinary retention as a 
presenting symptom does not appear to have been mentioned in the English 
literature.

Radiographic and scintigraphic evaluation of spondylosis in the equine 
thoracolumbar spine: a retrospective study.

Meehan L(1), Dyson S, Murray R.

Author information:
(1)Centre for Equine Studies, Animal Health Trust, Lanwades Park, Kentford, 
Newmarket, Suffolk CB8 7UU, UK.

REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Clinical, radiographic and scintigraphic signs 
associated with spondylosis of the equine thoracolumbar spine have been poorly 
documented.
OBJECTIVES: To establish an objective radiographic and scintigraphic grading 
system for spondylosis lesions; to estimate the prevalence of spondylosis in a 
population of horses with back pain; and to compare the results of radiography 
and scintigraphy.
METHODS: Radiographic images of the thoracolumbar spine from 670 horses with 
clinical signs of back pain were graded. Scintigraphic images from horses with 
spondylosis lesions underwent subjective and objective analysis. Sensitivity and 
specificity of scintigraphy for detection of spondylosis relative to radiography 
for identification of spondylosis were calculated, and Chi-squared analysis was 
performed to test for an association between location and severity of lesions.
RESULTS: Twenty-three of 670 horses (3.4%) with back pain had radiographic 
evidence of spondylosis. Of these horses, 14 (61%) had more than one lesion and 
44% (n=22) of lesions occurred between T11-T13 vertebral bodies. Only 33% (n=28) 
of locations with radiographic changes had increased radiopharmaceutical uptake.
CONCLUSION: Spondylosis occurs at a low prevalence in horses with back pain. It 
may be present alone or in association with other osseous abnormalities. The 
clinical significance of spondylosis needs further investigation.
POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Spondylosis is uncommon but may be a contributor to back 
pain in the horse.

Flexion-relaxation and clinical features associated with chronic low back pain: 
A comparison of different methods of quantifying flexion-relaxation.

Alschuler KN(1), Neblett R, Wiggert E, Haig AJ, Geisser ME.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, USA.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to simultaneously assess 5 surface 
electromyography (SEMG) ratios commonly used to quantify the flexion relaxation 
phenomenon in chronic low back pain patients relative to clinical and 
musculoskeletal abnormalities.
METHODS: Seventy-six persons with low back pain (LBP) were assessed through SEMG 
in standing, flexion, maximum voluntary flexion, and extension. Additionally, 
participants were assessed for clinical status (pain intensity, perceived 
disability, and pain-related fear) and musculoskeletal abnormalities (supine 
straight leg raise, Faber test, and lumbar restrictions).
RESULTS: Flexion-relaxation assessed as the ratio of maximum SEMG during flexion 
to average SEMG during maximum voluntary flexion, and maximum SEMG during 
extension to average SEMG during maximum voluntary flexion, demonstrated that 
highest associations with clinical and musculoskeletal status. Ratio of maximum 
SEMG during flexion to average SEMG during maximum voluntary flexion was 
significantly associated with 2 measures of perceived disability (both rs=-0.31, 
P<0.01), pain-related fear (r=-0.45, P<0.001), as well as range of motion during 
flexion (r=0.51, P<0.001), and elicitation of pain during straight leg raise 
(r=0.30, P<0.05). Ratio of maximum SEMG during extension to average SEMG during 
maximum voluntary flexion was also significantly associated with these same 
measures, at a slightly higher magnitude, in addition to a measure of clinical 
pain (r=-0.29, P<0.05).
DISCUSSIONS: These data suggest that measures of flexion-relaxation that 
contrast SEMG during flexion or extension to MVF are more highly associated with 
clinical status compared with measures that contrast SEMG during flexion and 
extension, SEMG whereas standing to MVF, or SEMG during MVF alone.

Schmorl's nodes (SNs) are common abnormalities in the human spine, which 
represent herniation of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc into the 
adjacent cartilaginous endplate of the vertebra. However, the principle 
mechanism of SNs is still not fully understood. And the relationship of SNs in 
the spine and their clinical significance as a source of low back pain in the 
general population remains unknown. It is therefore important to get better 
understanding of this. Here, we review the clinical and experiment evidence on 
inducing of the SNs and correlative back pain, and propose a possible mechanism. 
Studies showed that once the nucleus pulposus enters into vascular tissue, the 
immune system could recognize it as a foreign body, and induces the 
immunological reaction. Then, there would be osteoimmunology action, a crosstalk 
between the immune system and bone, leading to bone loss by dysregulating 
T-lymphocyte function, and resulting to the bone absorption. Furthermore, the 
cytokines are involved in the development of immunological reactions and could 
be responsible for the significant pathology of symptomatic SNs. Given the above 
background, we hypothesize that immune system could be a key role in SNs and 
result in the pain.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
OBJECTIVE: To review findings from 3 patients who underwent spine-shortening 
vertebral osteotomy for tethered cord syndrome with a minimum follow-up of 3 
years.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical detethering is the gold standard for 
symptomatic tethered cord syndrome. However, complications such as cerebrospinal 
fluid leakage and neurologic deterioration are common. Spine-shortening 
vertebral osteotomy, proposed by Kokubun, is an alternative surgical technique 
to reduce neural tension indirectly. However, case series of this novel 
procedure for tethered cord syndrome have not been reported in the English 
literature.
METHODS: Three patients aged 13, 22, and 27 years presented with progressive 
pain and/or neurologic dysfunction. They underwent spine-shortening vertebral 
osteotomy of L1 with a pedicle screw and rod system. Their clinical and 
radiologic outcomes are reviewed.
RESULTS: All patients got relief from their preoperative symptoms after surgery, 
and no complications occurred. Complete bone union was obtained in all patients 
without correction loss.
CONCLUSION: Spine-shortening vertebral osteotomy can be a safe and alternative 
surgical technique for tethered cord syndrome.

Clinical and radiological findings of discogenic low back pain confirmed by 
automated pressure-controlled discography.

Kim HG(1), Shin DA, Kim HI, Yoo EA, Shin DG, Lee JO.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurosurgery, Presbyterian Medical Center, Jeonju, Korea.

OBJECTIVE: Few studies on the clinical spectrum of automated pressure-controlled 
discography (APCD)-defined positive discs have been reported to date. Thus, the 
present study was undertaken to analyze clinical parameters critical for 
diagnosis of discogenic pain and to correlate imaging findings with intradiscal 
pressures and pain responses in patients with APCD-positive discs.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients who showed APCD-positive discs were selected for 
analysis. CT discogram findings and the degrees of nuclear degeneration seen on 
MRI were analyzed in comparison to changes of intradiscal pressure that provoked 
pain responses; and clinical pain patterns and dynamic factors were evaluated in 
relation to pain provocation.
RESULTS: Low back pain (LBP), usually centralized, with diffuse leg pain was the 
most frequently reported pattern of pain in these patients. Overall, LBP was 
most commonly induced by sitting posture, however, standing was highly 
correlated with L5/S1 disc lesions (p < 0.01). MRI abnormalities were 
statistically correlated with grading of CT discogram results (p < 0.05); with 
most pain response observed in CT discogram Grades 3 and 4. Pain-provoking 
pressure was not statistically correlated with MRI grading. However, it was 
higher in Grade 3 than Grade 4.
CONCLUSION: APCD-positive discs were demonstrated in patients reporting 
centralized low back pain with diffuse leg pain, aggravated by sitting and 
standing. MRI was helpful to assess the degree of nuclear degeneration, yet it 
could not guarantee exact localization of the painful discs. APCD was considered 
to be more useful than conventional discography for diagnosis of discogenic 
pain.

A metabolic cause of spinal deformity.

(1)Department of Rheumatology, Basel University, Burgfelderstr. 55, CH 4012 
Basel, Switzerland.

A 38-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 6-year history of chronic low 
back pain. Physical examination showed limited spine mobility; radiographs of 
the spine demonstrated narrowed disk spaces and calcifications. Lumbar spine 
magnetic resonance imaging showed Modic type II signal intensity changes in the 
bone marrow consistent with chronic disk degeneration. The finding of a 
massively elevated excretion of homogentisic acid (HGA) in the patient's urine 
confirmed the suspicion that the complaints were due to underlying alkaptonuria. 
Alkaptonuria (ochronosis) is an uncommon cause of backache and results from 
mutations in homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, an enzyme involved in tyrosine 
catabolism. Homogentisic acid accumulates in the plasma of the affected 
individuals, and HGA polymers deposit in connective tissues where they cause 
cartilage degeneration. So far, there is no proven treatment; but preclinical 
and phase I data with nitisinone, an inhibitor of HGA formation, are promising. 
Currently, the effects of nitisinone on joint mobility are being evaluated in a 
randomized trial. Clinicians involved in the care of musculoskeletal problems 
should be aware of this rare disorder, particularly because the correct 
diagnosis may have therapeutic implications.

Muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging and acute low back pain: a pilot 
study to characterize lumbar muscle activity asymmetries and examine the effects 
of osteopathic manipulative treatment.

Osteopathic Medicine, Northfield, OH, USA. clarkb2@ohio.edu.

BACKGROUND: Muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging (mfMRI) measures 
transverse relaxation time (T2), and allows for determination of the spatial 
pattern of muscle activation. The purposes of this pilot study were to examine 
whether MRI-derived T2 or side-to-side differences in T2 (asymmetries) differ in 
low back muscles between subjects with acute low back pain (LBP) compared to 
asymptomatic controls, and to determine if a single osteopathic manipulative 
treatment (OMT) session alters these T2 properties immediately and 48-hours 
after treatment.
METHODS: Subjects with non-specific acute LBP (mean score on 110 visual analog 
score = 3.02 +/- 2.81) and asymptomatic controls (n = 9/group) underwent an MRI, 
and subsequently the LBP subjects received OMT and then underwent another MRI. 
The LBP subjects reported back for an additional MRI 48-hours following their 
initial visit. T2 and T2 asymmetry were calculated from regions of interest for 
the psoas, quadratus lumborum (QL), multifidus, and iliocostalis 
lumborum/longissimus thoracis (IL/LT) muscles.
RESULTS: No differences were observed between the groups when T2 was averaged 
for the left and right side muscles. However, the QL displayed a significantly 
greater T2 asymmetry in LBP subjects when compared to controls (29.1 +/- 4.3 vs. 
15.9 +/- 4.1%; p = 0.05). The psoas muscle also displayed a relatively large, 
albeit non-significant, mean difference (22.7 +/- 6.9 vs. 9.5 +/- 2.8%; p = 
0.11). In the subjects with LBP, psoas T2 asymmetry was significantly reduced 
immediately following OMT (25.3 +/- 6.9 to 6.1 +/- 1.8%, p = 0.05), and the 
change in LBP immediately following OMT was correlated with the change in psoas 
T2 asymmetry (r = 0.75, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Collectively, this pilot work demonstrates the feasibility of mfMRI 
for quantification and localization of muscle abnormalities in patients with 
acute low back pain. Additionally, this pilot work provides insight into the 
mechanistic actions of OMT during acute LBP, as it suggests that it may 
attenuate muscle activity asymmetries of some of the intrinsic low back muscles.

Exophytic intramedullary mature teratoma of the conus medullaris: case report 
and review of the literature.

BACKGROUND: Intramedullary tumors affect a small but significant portion of 
patients with spinal tumors. Ependymomas and astrocytomas are the most common 
entities. The diagnosis of a mature teratoma is extremely rare, although not in 
the presence of associated developmental abnormalities. The medullary conus is 
the most common location. Such a case with caudal exophytic growth is presented 
here and the literature extensively reviewed.
CASE PRESENTATION: Low back pain and muscle weakness led to diagnosis of a 
exophytic intramedullary lesion of the conus medullaris in a 52-year-old woman. 
After subtotal resection the symptomatology partially improved. 
Histopathological examination revealed mature teratoma.
CONCLUSION: Literature review identified 68 cases of intramedullary teratomas. 
These should be considered in the differential diagnosis when an associated 
developmental abnormality is present. Subtotal resection is a valid alternative 
to radical tumor removal when neurological function is at risk. The prognosis of 
adult patients with intramedullary mature teratoma is excellent.

Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) is a rare and potentially fatal 
reaction characterized by fever, rash, and internal organ involvement that 
typically occurs between 3 and 6 weeks after commencing the drug. We describe 
such a case in a 26-year-old woman, who developed fever, exfoliative 
erythroderma, facial edema, cervical lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and 
leukocytosis 6 weeks after commencing carbamazepine for lower back pain. Her 
serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level was also raised to 144 U/L (8-52 U/L). 
Skin biopsies demonstrated an unusual superficial dermal perivascular 
inflammatory infiltrate, which included conspicuous granulomas mixed with 
moderate numbers of lymphocytes. Eosinophils were not a feature. Her 
carbamazepine was withdrawn, and oral prednisone was commenced initially at a 
dose of 1 mg.kg.d and slowly weaned over a 6-week period. Her fever, rash, 
facial edema, and hepatitis gradually resolved within this period, and her serum 
angiotensin-converting enzyme level returned to within the normal range. 
Although the patient's clinical course was consistent with a DIHS, it was 
accompanied by a previously unreported finding of a superficial granulomatous 
dermatitis. Granuloma formation as a sequel to medication use is a feature of 
interstitial granulomatous drug reaction. However, interstitial granulomatous 
drug reaction consists of localized violaceous plaques with a predilection for 
skin fold areas and liver function abnormalities have not been described. 
Granulomatous inflammation in other organ systems, including the liver and 
kidney, has also been described after the use of carbamazepine, but these 
reactions are not associated with the systemic manifestations observed in DIHS.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the hepatic safety and tolerability of celecoxib versus 
placebo and three commonly prescribed nonselective nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, pooled analysis of a 
41-study dataset involving patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, and Alzheimer's disease. Criteria 
for selection of studies were: (1) Randomized, parallel-group design and planned 
treatment duration of > or =2 weeks (2) > or =1 placebo or NSAID comparator (3) 
> or =1 arm with celecoxib at total daily dose of > or =200 mg (4) Data 
available as of October 31, 2004 Data were pooled by treatment and subject from 
the safety analysis population of included studies. Treatment-emergent 
hepatobiliary adverse events (AEs) were compared for celecoxib <200 mg/day (943 
patients), 200 mg/day (12 008 patients), 400 mg/day (7380 patients), and 800 
mg/day (4602 patients); placebo (4057 patients); diclofenac 100-150 mg/day (7639 
patients); naproxen 1000 mg/day (2953 patients); and ibuprofen 2400 mg/day (2484 
patients). Hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities were also analyzed.
RESULTS: There were no cases of liver failure, treatment-related liver 
transplant, or treatment-related hepatobiliary death. Incidence of serious 
hepatic AEs was low, with 13 (0.05%) serious hepatic AEs among 24 933 
celecoxib-treated patients, and 16 (0.21%) among 7639 diclofenac-treated 
patients. No patients receiving celecoxib or any nonselective NSAID met criteria 
for Hy's rule (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > or =3 x upper limit of normal 
[ULN] with bilirubin > or =2 x ULN). The incidence of notable (> or =5 x ULN) 
and severe (> or =10 x ULN) ALT elevations was similar for all treatment groups 
except diclofenac. Significantly fewer hepatobiliary AEs were reported for 
celecoxib (any dose; 1.11%) than for diclofenac (vs. 4.24%, p < 0.0001); for 
ibuprofen (vs. 1.53%, p = 0.06) and placebo (vs. 0.89%, p = 0.21) the incidence 
of AEs was comparable to celecoxib.
LIMITATIONS: A number of limitations should be considered when evaluating the 
results: findings were limited by the quality and reporting of the studies 
selected; difficulty in estimating the incidence of AEs due to the low frequency 
of events; acetaminophen not included as an active comparator.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pooled analysis, the incidence of hepatic AEs in patients 
treated with celecoxib was similar to that for both placebo-treated patients and 
patients treated with ibuprofen or naproxen, but lower than for diclofenac.

BACKGROUND: Agenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is an uncommon congenital 
vascular malformation. We report a case in a teenage female recently started on 
oral contraception.
CASE: Because of menorrhagia, the patient had begun an oral contraceptive pill 
(OCP) 1(1/2) months prior to presentation. She initially presented with pelvic 
and lower back pain, and imaging showed a pelvic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) 
and an interrupted IVC. Anticoagulation was started, the OCP was discontinued, 
and a discussion occurred regarding the treatment options for her menorrhagia 
following her recent diagnosis.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: The case presented shows the rare occurrence of the 
congenital absence of an IVC with pelvic thrombosis in a young female with a 
history of menorrhagia and new onset of pelvic pain. The evaluation of this case 
report leads to a comprehensive review in the treatment choice for menorrhagia 
with the preceding history of a thrombotic event.

Monostotic fibrous dysplasia of a lumbar vertebral body with secondary 
aneurysmal bone cyst formation: a case report.

Snieders MN, van Kemenade FJ, van Royen BJ.

We report the case of a 25-year-old Caucasian woman with symptomatic monostotic 
fibrous dysplasia of the fourth lumbar vertebral body. The patient suffered from 
a five-week history of progressive low back pain, radiating continuously to the 
left leg. Her medical history and physical and neurological examination did not 
demonstrate any significant abnormalities. Radiographs, computed tomography and 
magnetic resonance imaging revealed an osteolytic expansive lesion with a cystic 
component of the fourth lumbar vertebral body. Percutaneous transpedicular 
biopsy showed histological characteristics of fibrous dysplasia superimposed by 
the formation of aneurysmal bone cyst components. The patient was treated by 
subtotal vertebrectomy of the L4 vertebral body with anterior reconstruction and 
her postoperative course was uncomplicated. To our knowledge, this is the first 
reported case of a monostotic fibrous dysplasia with superimposed secondary 
aneurysmal bone cysts of a lumbar vertebral body.

Seoul, Korea.

We report here on an unusual case of multiple levels of asymmetric lumbar 
spondylolysis in a 19-year-old woman. The patient had severe low back pain of 
increasing intensity with lumbar instability, which was evident on the dynamic 
radiographs. MRI demonstrated the presence of abnormalities and the three 
dimensional CT scan revealed asymmetric complete spondylolysis at the left L2, 
L3 and L4 levels and the right L1, L2 and L3 levels. This case was treated 
surgically by posterior and posterolateral fusion at L2-3-4 with intersegmental 
fixation using pedicle screws and an auto iliac bone graft. The patient was 
relieved of her low back pain after the surgery.

The active straight leg raise test and lumbar spine stability.

Liebenson C(1), Karpowicz AM, Brown SH, Howarth SJ, McGill SM.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of the active straight leg raise (ASLR) test 
as a screen of lumbar spine stability and abdominal bracing (AB) ability.
DESIGN: A biomechanical study of the ASLR test as a clinical evaluation of 
lumbar spine stability and AB.
SETTING: Clinical research laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen participants who were currently asymptomatic for back 
pain and leg pain were evaluated.
METHODS: Spine posture, muscle activation, and pressure distributions underneath 
the supine subject were determined.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: An estimation of lumbar spine stiffness, a direct 
correlate with spine stability, was obtained using an anatomically detailed 
spine model.
RESULTS: AB during the ASLR reduced the center of pressure (CoP) movement on a 
strain-based pressure mat in lumbar rotation (P < .0125) as well as reducing 
directly measured lumbar rotation (P = .02). Active AB increased lumbar spine 
stiffness (P < .002). Regression analysis between stiffness and CoP movement 
suggested that different participants used different strategies to control torso 
motion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the ASLR has utility as a screen of 
lumbar spine stability and AB ability. The ASLR maneuver can assess control of 
lumbar rotational movements in the transverse plane. Finally, this study 
demonstrated that AB can measurably improve the rotational (transverse plane) 
stiffness of the lumbar spine.

Transitional lumbosacral vertebrae and low back pain: diagnostic pitfalls and 
management of Bertolotti's syndrome.

Almeida DB(1), Mattei TA, Sória MG, Prandini MN, Leal AG, Milano JB, Ramina R.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: Bertolotti's syndrome is a spine disorder characterized by the 
occurrence of a congenital lumbar transverse mega-apophysis in a transitional 
vertebral body that usually articulates with the sacrum or the iliac bone. It 
has been considered a possible cause of low back pain.
METHOD: We analyzed the cases of Bertolotti's syndrome that failed clinical 
treatment and reviewed the literature concerning this subject.
RESULTS: Five patients in our series had severe low back pain due to the 
neo-articulation and two of them were successfully submitted to surgical 
resection of the transverse mega-apophysis. Taking into account the clinical and 
surgical experience acquired with these cases, we propose a 
diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm.
CONCLUSION: There is still no consensus about the most appropriate therapy for 
Bertolotti's syndrome. In patients in whom the mega-apophysis itself may be the 
source of back pain, surgical resection may be a safe and effective procedure.

[Nerve root compression by gas containing lumbar disc herniation--case report].

The radiographic appearance of gas collection in the intervertebral disc 
represents the so-called "vacuum phenomenon." Incidence of the vacuum phenomenon 
on plain radiographs is reported to be 1-20%, whereas gas-containing disc 
herniations are rarely observed. We present a case report involving a patient 
with L4/5 gas-containing disc herniation, which was demonstrated by CT and MRI 
scans and was also surgically documented. A 48-year-old man with no previous 
back trauma presented with a 14-day history of left leg pain. On neurologic 
examination, the straight leg raising test was positive at 60degrees. Leg muscle 
strength was weak on the extensor hallucis longus. Sensory disturbances and 
abnormalities in deep-tendon reflexes were not observed. Lumbar roentogenograms 
showed "vacuum phenomenon" at L2/3, L4/5 and the L5/S disc space. MRI indicated 
a herniated disc at L4/5 displacing the dural sac and a focal low intensity in 
the lesion. Administration of an epidural block relieved the patient's symptoms. 
Ten months later, the patient reported a gradual return of similar left leg 
pain. His symptoms did not respond to conservative management. Lumbar spine 
films indicated abnormalities identical to the original results. MRI showed an 
enlarged area of low intensity with compression of the left L5 nerve root. In 
addition to recurrent pain, discography with metrizamide injections confirmed 
the presence of intradiscal gas and compression of the left L5 nerve root. 
During surgery, a gray-bluish air mass compressing the L5 nerve root was 
identified. Manipulation of the mass resulted in rupture and the release of gas. 
The displaced nerve root immediately relaxed to its normal position. Seven 
months after the operation, the patient remains free of pain.

OBJECTIVE: To correlate magnetic resonance (MR) image findings with pain 
response by provocation discography in patients with discogenic low back pain, 
with an emphasis on the combination analysis of a high intensity zone (HIZ) and 
disc contour abnormalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients (aged 17-68 years) with axial low back 
pain that was likely to be disc related underwent lumbar discography (178 discs 
tested). The MR images were evaluated for disc degeneration, disc contour 
abnormalities, HIZ, and endplate abnormalities. Based on the combination of an 
HIZ and disc contour abnormalities, four classes were determined: (1) normal or 
bulging disc without HIZ; (2) normal or bulging disc with HIZ; (3) disc 
protrusion without HIZ; (4) disc protrusion with HIZ. These MR image findings 
and a new combined MR classification were analyzed in the base of concordant 
pain determined by discography.
RESULTS: Disc protrusion with HIZ [sensitivity 45.5%; specificity 97.8%; 
positive predictive value (PPV), 87.0%] correlated significantly with concordant 
pain provocation (P < 0.01). A normal or bulging disc with HIZ was not 
associated with reproduction of pain. Disc degeneration (sensitivity 95.4%; 
specificity 38.8%; PPV 33.9%), disc protrusion (sensitivity 68.2%; specificity 
80.6%; PPV 53.6%), and HIZ (sensitivity 56.8%; specificity 83.6%; PPV 53.2%) 
were not helpful in the identification of a disc with concordant pain.
CONCLUSION: The proposed MR classification is useful to predict a disc with 
concordant pain. Disc protrusion with HIZ on MR imaging predicted positive 
discography in patients with discogenic low back pain.

Tizanidine and aceclofenac individually have shown efficacy in the treatment of 
low back pain. The efficacy and tolerability of the combination have not yet 
been established. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of aceclofenac-tizanidine fixed dose combination against aceclofenac 
alone in patients with acute low back pain. This double-blind, double-dummy, 
randomized, comparative, multicentric, parallel group study enrolled 197 
patients of either sex in the age range of 18-70 years with acute low back pain. 
The patients were randomized to receive either aceclofenac (100 mg)-tizanidine 
(2 mg) b.i.d or aceclofenac (100 mg) alone b.i.d for 7 days. The primary 
efficacy outcomes were pain intensity (on movement, at rest and at night; on VAS 
scale) and pain relief (on a 5-point verbal rating scale). The secondary 
efficacy outcomes measures included functional impairment (modified Schober's 
test and lateral body bending test) and patient's and investigator's global 
efficacy assessment. aceclofenac-tizanidine was significantly superior to 
aceclofenac for pain intensity (on movement, at rest and at night; P < 0.05) and 
pain relief (P = 0.00) on days 3 and 7. There was significant increase in spinal 
flexion in both the groups from baseline on days 3 and 7 with significant 
difference in favour of the combination group (P < 0.05). There were 
significantly more number of patients with excellent to good response for the 
aceclofenac-tizanidine treatment as compared to aceclofenac alone (P = 0.00). 
Both the treatments were well tolerated. In this study, aceclofenac-tizanidine 
combination was more effective than aceclofenac alone and had a favourable 
safety profile in the treatment of acute low back pain.

Comment in
    Pain Pract. 2009 May-Jun;9(3):165-6.

BACKGROUND: We investigated if correlations exist between medical history, 
tissue abnormalities, and cell types retrieved from the epidural space of 
patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) and chronic radicular pain (RP).
METHODS: Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board for the 
Protection of Human Subjects to study 191 patients undergoing epiduroscopy. 
Visual inspection was performed and abnormal areas were identified. A specimen 
obtained from the area using a cytology brush was processed by the Thin Prep 
technique. Patients were divided into four groups based on the presence or 
absence and intensity of LBP and RP. The gender and age of the patients were 
recorded, as was any history of prior back surgery. Areas of tissue 
abnormalities were rated according to changes in vascularity and amount of fat, 
fibrosis, and inflammation. Stenosis was assessed from magnetic resonance 
imaging or computerized tomography scan images. Cytologic assessments included 
notations of the presence or absence of erythrocytes, leukocytes, cell groups, 
lipocytes, spindled cells, and large round cells.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the number of patients from whom 
big round cells were obtained who had a high degree of LBP compared with the 
number of patients who had a high degree of both LBP and RP.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide a foundation for future studies of cells 
obtained from similar patients with the goal of furthering the understanding of 
the pathogenesis of LBP/RP.

Data on the necessity of performing screening mammographies in transsexual women 
are lacking. The main objective of this study was to assess the possibility to 
perform mammography and breast sonography in transsexual women. Fifty 
Dutch-speaking transsexual women were interviewed about the following: attitude 
towards mammography and breast sonography, importance attributed to and 
satisfaction with breast appearance, opinion about the necessity of breast 
check-up, expectations regarding discomfort during the exams and knowledge about 
the breast surgery. A fasting blood sample, clinical breast exam, mammography 
and breast sonography were performed. At mammography the following parameters 
were noted: density, technical quality, location of the prostheses, presence of 
any abnormalities and painfulness. At sonography the following parameters were 
recorded: density, presence of cysts, visualisation of retro-areolar ducts or 
any abnormalities. Twenty-three percent of patients are not aware of the type of 
breast implants and 79% do not know their position to the pectoral muscles. 
Patient satisfaction with the appearance of their breasts was rather high (7.94 
on a scale of 0-10). Mean expected and experienced pain from mammography was low 
(4.37 and 2.00 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference 
in expected pain between those who already had mammography and those who did 
not. There was a significant positive correlation between the expected and the 
experienced pain. Mammography and breast sonography were technically feasible 
and no gross anomalies were detected. Since both exams were judged as nearly 
painless, 98% of transsexual women intended to come back if they would be 
invited. Since breast cancer risk in transsexual women is largely unknown and 
breast exams are very well accepted, breast screening habits in this population 
should not differ from those of biological women.

BACKGROUND: Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV), is a structural anomaly, 
of the lumbosacral spine which has been variably associated with, low back pain 
(LBP) and its presence can also result in a level being wrongly identified 
pre-operatively.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, pattern of LSTV and its relationship 
with LBP in our tertiary hospital.
METHODS: A retrospective review of lumbosacral spine radiographs of 561 one 
consecutive patients with history of LBP was done from January 2006 to January 
2008. The presence or absence of LSTV and degenerative changes were documented.
RESULTS: Fifty-one ((9.1%)) out of 561 patients had LSTV. Type II (incomplete) 
LSTV was the commonest type, occurring in 86.3% of patient with LSTV. Patients 
less than 30yrs with LBP and LSTV had no degenerative changes, while all 
patients with LSTV above 50 yrs had degenerative changes.
CONCLUSION: Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae type II was the commonest seen in 
this study, furthermore, LSTV appears to be a causative factor of LBP in young 
individuals. Careful evaluation of spinal radiographs of patients with LBP 
belonging to this group is advocated to assess for the presence or absence of 
LSTV.

Spinal chronic subdural hematoma mimicking intradural tumor in a patient with 
history of Hemophilia A: case report.

Istanbul, Turkey. sylvius@live.com

A 22-year-old man with medical history of Hemophilia A was admitted with a 3- 
month history of low back pain radiating to the right leg. Neurological 
examination revealed no abnormalities. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
with gadolinium enhancement revealed an intradural extramedullary mass at the 
level of L1 reported as an intradural tumor. The patient was operated after 
Factor VIII replacement. Intraoperatively, the lesion was found to be a pure 
subdural hematoma. The histopathological examination revealed pure chronic 
hematoma. Postoperatively the patient's complaints showed improvement and he was 
discharged with no complications. Although MRI is the gold standard of diagnosis 
for spinal intradural tumors, some mass lesions remain difficult to diagnose. 
Spinal chronic subdural hematoma should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis in these patients, especially in those with coagulopathies, even in 
the absence of a history of trauma.

AIM: To investigate the correlation of congenital lumbosacral abnormalities with 
neurological signs in young patients with low back pain (LBP) MATERIAL AND 
METHODS: The study included 401 patients with LBP that lasted longer than 2 
weeks. All cases were screened by standard lumbosacral x-rays for the presence 
of the most common congenital vertebral abnormalities i.e. spina bifida occulta 
(SBO) and transitional vertebra (TV). Patients were divided into two groups 
according to presence of a neurological sign. Patients with a neurological sign 
were referred for computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients had a neurological sign. Congenital vertebral 
abnormalities were detected in 52 patients (12.1%); 34 of these (8.5%) were 
spina bifida, whereas 18 (4.5%) were transitional vertebra. SBO was most 
commonly observed at the S1 level (30 patients). No correlation for SBO or TV 
was determined in patients with and without neurological signs but these groups 
showed significant difference for disc herniation in CT or MRI (P=0.001). 
Congenital abnormalities had no correlation with disc herniation in CT or MRI.
CONCLUSION: LBP in young adults with TV or SBO showed no correlation with 
neurological signs. Therefore patients with prolonged LBP that present with 
neurological signs may be scheduled for CT and/or MRI, but reevaluation of the 
patient with psychometric tests is recommended if there is no neurological sign.

Low-back problems (LBP) are one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in 
the general population, with reported lifetime prevalences of 50% to 80%. Also, 
certain sports participants (e.g. gymnasts, alpine skiers, runners) are at risk 
of LBP and its repercussions. This epidemiological study was undertaken to 
examine the lifetime and 1-year prevalence of LBP among recreational Flemish 
self-contained breathing apparatus (scuba) divers and to identify general and 
sport-specific risk factors associated with the occurrence of LBP. A 
retrospective self-assessment questionnaire was developed and assessed for 
validity and reliability, to gather data concerning demographics, LBP prevalence 
and associated risk factors and injuries among active scuba divers. A total of 
181 recreational scuba divers (men: n = 138, mean age 40.3 +/- 12.8 years; 
women: n = 43, mean age 35.0 +/- 10.9 years) from 10 randomly selected 
internationally recognised scuba diving clubs participated in the study. 
Lifetime and 1-year prevalence of LBP among recreational Flemish scuba divers 
were 55.8% and 50.3%, respectively. General risk factors for LBP were found to 
include prior history of LBP, structural abnormalities, heavy workload, 
pregnancy and parturition, general fatigue and bending forwards and backwards. 
Scuba divers suffering from LBP generally had a significantly higher dive 
certificate than those without LBP (p = 0.007). Symptomatic scuba divers also 
used significantly more weights on their weight belts during indoor training (p 
= 0.003) and during outdoor dives with a dry suit (p = 0.044) as compared to 
asymptomatic scuba divers. In scuba diving, reliable sport-specific risk factors 
for LBP were found to be scarce. Further biomechanical research is required to 
point out whether or not scuba diving characteristics actually contribute to 
LBP.

Greece.

A 72-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of low back and leg pain. 
Past medical history revealed transurethral resection of bladder cancer followed 
by multiple intravesical BCG instillation 12 years ago. Imaging studies of the 
thoracolumbar spine showed osteolysis of the L3 and L4 vertebrae and the 
associated intervertebral disc space, and a large soft tissue mass with signal 
abnormalities suggesting of an abscess. CT-guided needle biopsy showed 
Mycobacterium bovis infection. A triple anti-tuberculous chemotherapy regimen 
including isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol was administered for 12 months. 
Surgical treatment included drainage of the abscess and L2-L5 spinal 
instrumentation and fusion. Intravesical BCG therapy may be complicated by late 
disseminated disease to the bone even many years after initial BCG therapy. 
Patients having BCG therapy should be closely evaluated thereafter for the 
possibility of hematogenous spread of mycobacteria to distant sites.

Inflammatory back pain is more than just inflammatory pain, but a set of 
symptoms which presence must evoke a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. 
However, it is insufficient by itself for a diagnosis which can only be reach as 
part of a diagnostic strategy searching for other clinical, biological or 
radiological abnormalities in order to obtain adequate diagnostic probability, 
while acknowledging the limitations of all these examinations.

PURPOSE: This study aims to describe solely endoscopic surgical techniques for 
the treatment of spinal pathology. Here, we present a novel endoscopic technique 
for surgical untethering of the spinal cord by filum sectioning and discuss 
endoscopic surgical management of this entity.
METHODS: Two patients (ages 8 months and 10 years) presented with leg weakness, 
urine and bowel dysfunction, low back and neck pain, and thickened, fatty filum 
terminale. The elder patient presented with clinical incontinence and abnormal 
urodynamic studies.
RESULTS: Both patients underwent a solely endoscopic approach using 0 degrees 
and 30 degrees , 4 mm in diameter and 18 cm in length rigid endoscopes via a 
hemilaminectomy. Intradural microdissection under a direct visualization of 
endoscope delivered the fatty filum into the durotomy. Electrical stimulation 
was performed while the lower extremities and the anal sphincter were monitored 
for electromyographic activity. After acquisition of positive controls, the 
filum was identified by the lack of sphincter and lower extremity 
electromyographic responses and was then cauterized and cut. Both patients had 
significant improvement of their preoperative symptoms, and one patient had 
resolution of the abnormal urodynamics and her Chiari symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Tethered spinal cords can be safely and effectively untethered 
endoscopically. This procedure provides the advantages of reduced soft tissue 
injury, less postoperative pain, minimal blood loss, a smaller incision, and a 
shorter hospitalization. However, whether the endoscopic untethering technique 
achieves benefits above those associated with the open procedure remains to be 
determined by a control study.

Extraspinal findings on lumbar spine MR imaging.

Gebara NV(1), Meltzer DE.

Author information:

USA.

Interpretation of radiologic studies requires vigilance on the part of the 
radiologist to identify findings and abnormalities outside the region of 
interest. In the case of routine lumbar spine MRI for low back pain, many 
extraspinal abnormalities can often be identified. Some of these findings may 
account for low back pain. Other findings are incidental, but may have 
significant clinical implications, and are important to recognize. We present 
twenty-four examples of incidental findings from lumbar spine MRI examinations. 
The findings involve various organ systems, covering a broad range of clinical 
urgency.

Spontaneous spinal subdural haematoma (SSDH) with no underlying pathology is a 
very rare condition. Only 20 cases have been previously reported. It can be 
caused by abnormalities of coagulation, blood dyscrasia, or trauma, underlying 
neoplasm, and arteriovenous malformation. It occurs most commonly in the 
thoracic spine and presents with sudden back pain radiating to the arms, legs or 
trunk, and varying degrees of motor, sensory, and autonomic disturbances. 
Although the main approach to management is surgical decompression, conservative 
management is used as well. We report the case of a 57-year-old man who 
presented with sudden severe low back pain followed by rapid onset of complete 
paraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an anterior subdural 
haematoma from T9 to L1 with cord compression. Corticosteroid treatment was 
administered. The patient showed substantial clinical improvement after 7 days 
of bed rest and an intense rehabilitation programme. An MRI scan and a computed 
tomography angiogram did not reveal any underlying pathology to account for the 
subdural haematoma.

We have presented a patient of 71-year-age with brucellar spondylodiscitis, 
involving the cervical spine, especially the C3-C4 segment. The patient had 
painful percussion of the cervical spine and passive mobilization of the neck, 
decreased range of motion, and cervical paravertebral tenderness; but no 
abnormalities observed on neurological examination. Wright agglutination test 
for brucella was positive at 1/320. Cervical localization for brucellar 
spondylodiscitis is an unusual case and should be detected and treated as early 
as possible. In endemic regions, spinal involvement of brucellosis should be 
considered in cases with fever, neck and low back pain.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest an association between sciatica and 
Propionibacterium acnes. "Modic type I changes" in the vertebrae are closely 
associated with sciatica and lower back pain, and recent studies have questioned 
the ability of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate 
between degenerative Modic type I changes and vertebral abnormalities caused by 
infection.
PURPOSE: To test whether bacteria could be cultured from biopsies of Modic type 
I changes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with Modic type I changes 
in lumbar vertebrae had a biopsy taken from the affected vertebra by a strict 
aseptic procedure. The biopsy was split into two specimens, which were 
inoculated into thioglycolate agar tubes in the surgical theatre and transported 
to the microbiology laboratory. In the laboratory, one specimen was streaked 
onto plates and analyzed for anaerobic and aerobic culture. The other tube was 
left unopened and incubated directly. Plates and tubes were incubated for 2 
weeks and observed for visible growth.
RESULTS: None of the biopsies yielded growth of anaerobic bacteria. In one 
patient, both biopsies yielded growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and in 
another patient coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from one biopsy. 
Both patients received oral antibiotics without convincing effect on symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed no evidence of bacteria in vertebrae with Modic 
type I changes. The isolation of staphylococci from two patients probably 
represented contamination.

Ontario, Canada, L9G 5C5. k_murtaugh@hotmail.com

This study examines the relationship between radiological evidence of lumbar 
transitional vertebrae (LTV) and the clinical presentation of low back pain 
(LBP). A retrospective review of 232 consecutive patients presenting at a 
specialist musculo-skeletal clinic with LBP was conducted. The medical chart for 
each patient was reviewed for: gender, birth date, symptoms, physical findings, 
imaging results, and medications prescribed. Subjects were recognized as having 
a lumbar transitional vertebra if it was noted on their x-ray report. The 
prevalence of LTV was 9.5 %. This study is consistent with previous research, 
indicating that the prevalence of LTV is not significantly higher amongst 
patients with LBP. However, this study also provides further detail about the 
clinical presentation and management of patients with LTV. The information 
presented in this study will assist health care professionals in determining the 
clinical significance of a LTV seen on an x-ray film or noted in a radiologist's 
report.

Butterfly vertebra: an uncommon congenital spinal anomaly.

Patinharayil G(1), Han CW, Marthya A, Meethall KC, Surendran S, Rudrappa GH.

Author information:

STUDY DESIGN: This is a report of a patient with T6 butterfly vertebra, which is 
an uncommon congenital spinal anomaly.
OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the significance of identifying butterfly vertebra that 
may be confused with other pathologic conditions like fractures, infections, and 
metastases.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: We report a 46-year-old woman with butterfly 
vertebra of T6 spine. The patient presented with complaints of low back pain and 
examination showed an abnormal bony prominence at midthoracic level. Radiologic 
and hematologic investigations confirmed the presence of butterfly vertebrae at 
T6 level, which proved to be a coincidental finding along with nonspecific low 
back pain. Knowledge about this condition is very important, since the condition 
can be easily confused with a pathologic fracture.
METHODS: The patient presented with a history of low back pain of 2 months. The 
patient was evaluated clinically and with hematological investigations. The 
diagnosis was confirmed with computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans.
RESULTS: Routine examination of the motor and sensory system was found to be 
normal. Roentgenogram of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine showed anterior 
wedging of T6 vertebrae in the lateral view and features suggestive of the 
presence of a butterfly vertebra at T6 level in the anteroposterior (AP) view. 
Hematologic evaluation was done to rule out pathologic causes of anterior 
wedging of the vertebra like infections and metastases in the spine. MRI and CT 
scans of the spine confirmed the presence of T6 butterfly vertebra. Patient was 
treated for her low back pain and assured that the abnormal midthoracic bony 
prominence was a benign condition that needs no treatment.
CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion is needed to identify this benign spinal 
anomaly that may be confused with many pathologic conditions. Knowledge of this 
condition helps in making rational use of extensive noninvasive and invasive 
diagnostic procedures.

BACKGROUND: Co-administration of a fibrate and statin is an effective treatment 
option for patients with multiple lipid abnormalities, yet adequate long-term 
safety and efficacy data are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of fenofibric acid 
combined with statins in adults with mixed dyslipidemia.
METHODS: Three large, 12-week, phase three, double-blind, randomized, controlled 
trials evaluated fenofibric acid 135 mg combined with a low- or moderate-dose 
statin compared to fenofibric acid or statin monotherapy, and a subsequent 
52-week open-label extension study evaluated fenofibric acid 135 mg combined 
with moderate-dose statin (rosuvastatin 20 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, or 
atorvastatin 40 mg). This prespecified analysis integrated results from these 
studies to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of combination therapy.
RESULTS: Across the controlled studies and the extension study, 2201 patients 
received at least one dose of fenofibric acid + statin for a median duration of 
364 days. The most common adverse events were headache, upper respiratory tract 
infection, nasopharyngitis, and back pain, with the incidence of all adverse 
events being similar across all combination therapy treatment groups. 
Rhabdomyolysis or treatment-related death was not reported in any group. 
Combination therapy resulted in sustained improvements in multiple lipid 
parameters, including triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, 
and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.
CONCLUSION: Long-term fenofibric acid + statin combination therapy was generally 
well tolerated and resulted in comprehensive and sustained improvements in 
multiple lipid parameters in adults with mixed dyslipidemia.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a commercial 
abdominal machine (Ab-Slide) and three common abdominal strengthening exercises 
(abdominal crunch, supine double leg thrust, and side bridge) on activating 
abdominal and minimizing extraneous (nonabdominal) musculature-namely, the 
rectus femoris muscle. We recruited 10 males and 12 females whose mean (+/- SD) 
percent body fat was 10.7 +/- 4 and 20.7% +/- 3.2%, respectively. 
Electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded using surface electrodes for the 
rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, and rectus femoris. We 
recorded peak EMG activity for each muscle during each of the four exercises and 
normalized the EMG values by maximum muscle contractions (% MVIC). A two-factor 
repeated-measures analysis of variance assessed differences in normalized EMG 
activity among the different exercise variations (p < 0.05). Post hoc analyses 
were performed using the Bonferroni-adjusted alpha to assess between-exercise 
pair comparisons (p < 0.002). Gender did not affect performance; hence, data 
were collapsed across gender. We found a muscle x exercise interaction (F9,189 = 
5.2, p < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed six pairwise differences. The 
Ab-Slide elicited the greatest EMG activity for the abdominal muscles and the 
least for the rectus femoris. The supine double leg thrust could be a problem 
for patients with low-back pathology due to high rectus femoris muscle activity.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between 
alternative measures of exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) and low back pain 
(LBP) in professional drivers.
METHODS: The incidence of 12-month LBP, high pain intensity (numerical rating 
scale score > 5), and disability in the lower back (Roland and Morris disability 
scale score >or=12) was investigated in a cohort of 537 drivers over a 2-year 
follow-up period. LBP outcomes, individual characteristics, and work-related 
risk factors were investigated by direct interview using a structured 
questionnaire. Daily vibration exposure was expressed in terms of either 
equivalent acceleration over an 8-h reference period [A(8), root-mean-square 
(r.m.s.) method] or vibration dose value [VDV, root-mean-quad (r.m.q.) method]. 
From the vibration magnitudes measured on vehicles and total exposure duration, 
seven alternative measures of cumulative vibration exposure were calculated for 
each driver, using expressions of the form Sigma a (i)(m)t(i), where a (i) is 
the frequency-weighted r.m.s. or r.m.q. acceleration magnitude on vehicle 
i(a(ws) or a (wq), respectively), t(i) is the lifetime exposure duration for 
vehicle i, and m = 0, 1, 2, or 4.
RESULTS: In the drivers' cohort, the cumulative incidence of LBP outcomes were 
36.3% for 12-month LBP, 24.6% for high pain intensity, and 19.2% for disability 
in the lower back. A transition model, which takes into account the temporal 
sequence of cause and effect and captures the longitudinal part of the 
relationship, showed that VDV performed better than A(8) for the prediction of 
LBP outcomes. After adjusting for potential confounders, test for trends 
suggested an increased risk for developing high pain intensity and disability 
over time (and, to a lesser extent, 12-month LBP) with the increases of 
cumulative vibration doses computed from lifetime exposure duration and r.m.q. 
vibration magnitude (i.e. Sigma[a (wqi)(m)t(i)]). Measures of exposure duration, 
either daily or lifetime, also provided good indications of risk for LBP 
outcomes over time. Physical work load, but not psychosocial environment, was 
significantly associated with the occurrence of LBP outcomes over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Measures of vibration exposure derived from exposure duration 
(daily or lifetime) and r.m.q. acceleration magnitude (VDV, 
Sigma[a(wqi)(m)t(i)]) were better predictors of LBP outcomes over time than 
measures of vibration exposure including r.m.s. acceleration (A(8), summation 
operator[a(wsi)(m)t(i)]). Patterns of exposure-response relationship were more 
evident for the outcomes high pain intensity or disability in the lower back 
than for the binary response 12-month LBP.

A 69 years old woman with chronic low back pain referred to our Department for 
bone scintigraphy. Patient did not have any other complaint and his physical 
examination of the patient was normal. Whole-body scan was acquired 3 h after 
the intravenous injection of 740 MBq of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate 
((99m)Tc-MDP). Distal sacrococcygeal region could not be observed during the 
visual analysis of the whole-body scan. Pelvic X-rays radiography and pelvic 
computed tomography of the patient, demonstrated hemiagenesis of the sacrum, 
which was consistent with type-2 sacral agenesis. Other structural abnormalities 
were not detected on the pelvic CT scan of the patient. This case is presented 
to demonstrate the rare congenital anomaly of sacral hemiagenesis causing empty 
pelvis appearance in the posterior projection of (99m)Tc-MDP whole body bone 
scan. This congenital anomaly could be associated with extensive abnormalities 
of the lower vertebrae, pelvis, and spine.

Chronic pain is difficult to diagnose and treat, and is often comorbid with 
psychiatric conditions. Pain and mood disorders may share neurologic pathways 
and a neurochemical base. For example, depression is associated with 
abnormalities in serotonin and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters that also 
modulate the endogenous analgesic system. Further, co-occurring depression and 
pain may obscure a diagnosis of the other, secondary condition. Agents that 
inhibit pain signals and boost serotonin and norepinephrine levels, such as 
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), may provide pain relief as 
well as alleviate psychiatric symptom. Psychotherapies and education should also 
be considered to help patients achieve optimal functioning. The pathophysiology, 
diagnosis, and treatment of pain and mood disorders are discussed in this video, 
which features case studies of and expert commentary on patients with diabetic 
neuropathy, lower back pain, and chronic widespread pain.

Subchondral signal abnormalities have been suggested to play an important role 
in chronic low back pain (LBP) syndromes. Their natural course is not well 
known. In this study the morphology and natural course of isolated subchondral 
signal abnormalities in the lumbosacral spine were analyzed with MRI. 
Twenty-four chronic LBP patients with a subchondral hypointensity on T1-weighted 
image (hyperintense on T2), indicating edema, were selected from a base 
population of 1,015 consecutive LBP patients to a follow-up MRI study within 
18-72 months. Exclusion criteria were age >60 years, nerve root compression, a 
more specific back disease or a recent or major spine operation. The size and 
location of each subchondral signal abnormality and endplate lesion and the 
degree of degenerative disc changes were evaluated and compared between the 
baseline and follow-up studies. Most subchondral hypointensities were found at 
the L4/L5 or L5/S1 disc space, anteriorly and in both adjacent endplates. Almost 
all (53/54) hypointensities were associated with an endplate lesion. Twelve of 
the 54 subchondral hypointensities enlarged, six remained constant and 36 
decreased or disappeared while five new ones appeared. Twenty-two (41%) 
hypointensities changed totally to hyperintensities or to mixed lesions. If the 
hypointensity increased, decreased or changed into hyperintensity, a change 
tended to develop in the adjacent endplate. If the hypointensity was absent or 
unchanged, endplate lesions did not tend to progress. In the absence of disc 
herniation or other specific spinal disease, subchondral hypointensities 
indicating edema are uncommon. They seem to have a highly variable course. There 
appears to be a link between endplate lesions and subchondral signal 
abnormalities. Further study is needed to explain the contribution of these 
findings to low back symptoms.

syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: Greater trochanter pain syndrome due to tendinopathy or bursitis is a 
common cause of hip pain. The previously reported magnetic resonance (MR) 
findings of trochanteric tendinopathy and bursitis are peritrochanteric fluid 
and abductor tendon abnormality. We have often noted peritrochanteric high T2 
signal in patients without trochanteric symptoms. The purpose of this study was 
to determine whether the MR findings of peritrochanteric fluid or hip abductor 
tendon pathology correlate with trochanteric pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 131 consecutive MR 
examinations of the pelvis (256 hips) for T2 peritrochanteric signal and 
abductor tendon abnormalities without knowledge of the clinical symptoms. Any T2 
peritrochanteric abnormality was characterized by size as tiny, small, medium, 
or large; by morphology as feathery, crescentic, or round; and by location as 
bursal or intratendinous. The clinical symptoms of hip pain and trochanteric 
pain were compared to the MR findings on coronal, sagittal, and axial T2 
sequences using chi-square or Fisher's exact test with significance assigned as 
p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Clinical symptoms of trochanteric pain syndrome were present in only 16 
of the 256 hips. All 16 hips with trochanteric pain and 212 (88%) of 240 without 
trochanteric pain had peritrochanteric abnormalities (p = 0.15). Eighty-eight 
percent of hips with trochanteric symptoms had gluteus tendinopathy while 50% of 
those without symptoms had such findings (p = 0.004). Other than tendinopathy, 
there was no statistically significant difference between hips with or without 
trochanteric symptoms and the presence of peritrochanteric T2 abnormality, its 
size or shape, and the presence of gluteus medius or minimus partial thickness 
tears.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with trochanteric pain syndrome always have 
peritrochanteric T2 abnormalities and are significantly more likely to have 
abductor tendinopathy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, although the 
absence of peritrochanteric T2 MR abnormalities makes trochanteric pain syndrome 
unlikely, detection of these abnormalities on MRI is a poor predictor of 
trochanteric pain syndrome as these findings are present in a high percentage of 
patients without trochanteric pain.

OBJECTIVES: Vertebral osteomyelitis is a cause of back pain that can lead to 
neurologic deficits if not diagnosed in time and effectively treated. The 
objective of this study was to systematically review the clinical 
characteristics of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO).
METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic review of the English literature. 
The inclusion criteria included studies with 10 or more subjects diagnosed with 
PVO based on the combination of clinical presentation with either a definitive 
bacteriologic diagnosis or pathological and/or imaging studies.
RESULTS: The 14 studies that met selection criteria included 1008 patients with 
PVO. Of them, the majority (62%) were men, with back pain and fever as the most 
common presenting symptoms. Diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying 
medical illness, while the urinary tract was the commonest source of infection. 
Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism. Computed 
tomographic guided or open biopsy yielded the causative organism more often than 
blood cultures (77% versus 58%). Plain radiography showed abnormalities in 89% 
of the cases, while bone scanning and computed tomography or magnetic resonance 
imaging were positive in 94% of the cases, revealing lumbar as the most commonly 
affected area. The attributable mortality was 6%, while relapses and 
neurological deficits were described in the 32% and 32% of the cases, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: PVO is an illness of middle-aged individuals with underlying medical 
illnesses. Although the mortality rate is low, relapses and neurological 
deficits are common, making early diagnosis a major challenge for the physician.

Chronic low back pain is the most common cause of disability in individuals 
between the ages of 45 and 65. Given the variety of anatomic and 
pathophysiologic causes of persistent low back pain, it is a difficult diagnosis 
for clinicians to treat. Discography is a diagnostic option that may link a 
patient's subjective complaints of spinal pain to symptomatic disk disease when 
non-invasive imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), does not find 
structural abnormalities. A controversial procedure, discography is only 
necessary to assess painful discs prior to surgical interventions. For accurate 
discogram interpretation an experienced spine interventionalist must be careful 
to exclude false positive results and be aware of the patient's underlying 
psychological state. This literature review will discuss the following: anatomy 
and function of the spine and intervertebral disc, intervertebral disc 
degeneration and discogenic pain, history of discography, indications and 
contraindications, a description of the procedure, complications, and the 
current debate regarding its outcomes.

We report herein a 61-year-old man with diffuse leukoencephalopathy, subcortical 
infarcts and cervical and lumbar spondylosis. Medical history included baldness 
and lumbar spondylosis at young-adult onset. His parents were consanguineous 
(cousin). He had been experiencing severe lumbago since 20-years-old, with hair 
loss starting around the same time. He noticed dysarthria and gait disturbance 
at 59-years-old. He was admitted to our hospital at 61-years-old with 
aggravation of gait disturbance. On admission, no abnormalities were evident on 
physical examination except for diffuse baldness. Neurological findings included 
mild dementia, bilateral hyperreflexia, paraparesis, right Babinski's sign, and 
pseudobulbar palsy. Blood pressure was normal. T2-weighted imaging of the brain 
revealed diffuse high-intensity in the periventricular white matter and 
subcortical infarcts in the brainstem and bilateral basal ganglia. Marked lumbar 
deformations were observed on spinal MRI. Clinical features in this case met the 
criteria for cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical 
infarctions and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), apart from late onset of cerebral 
infarction.

Differences in low back pain behavior are reflected in the cerebral response to 
tactile stimulation of the lower back.

Lloyd D(1), Findlay G, Roberts N, Nurmikko T.

Author information:
(1)Magnetic Resonance and Image Analysis Research Centre (MARIARC), University 
of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.

STUDY DESIGN: Two groups of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) were 
scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation of the 
lower back; those showing 4 or 5 positive Waddell signs (WS-H) and those showing 
1 or none (WS-L) as an index of pain-related illness behavior.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that patients showing good versus poor adjustment to 
cLBP mobilize cortical affective-cognitive functions differently in response to 
sensory stimulation and show increased reorganization of somatosensory cortex 
corresponding to the back.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Some patients with cLBP go on to develop significant 
disability while the majority do not, and physical disease or psychosocial 
factors alone do not account for the difference. Neuroimaging studies have 
suggested abnormalities in cortical pain modulation systems can lead to variable 
pain and behavioral responses, which may account for these differences. 
METHODS.: Fifteen WS-L and 13 WS-H patients were scanned with functional 
magnetic resonance imaging while receiving intense tactile stimulation to the 
lower back. Questionnaire measures of psychosocial function were also collected.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in cLBP duration or lumbar 
stimulation tolerance threshold between the 2 groups. Significantly more 
activation was seen in the WS-L versus WS-H group in regions previously 
associated with normal affective-cognitive processing of sensory input including 
posterior cingulate and parietal cortices; the magnitude of this activation 
negatively correlated with catastrophizing scores. WS-H patients showed a modest 
medial shift in primary somatosensory cortex activation relative to the WS-L 
group.
CONCLUSION: Successful adjustment to cLBP is associated with a patient's ability 
to effectively engage a sensory modulation system. In patients in whom such 
activation does not occur, subjective lack of control maypredispose to altered 
affective and behavioral responses with poor adjustment to pain. Pain experience 
may be furthermodified by reorganization of somatosensory cortex, contributing 
to maintenance of the chronic pain state.

Paravertebral lumbar muscles are important for spine stabilization and mobility. 
They may be abnormal in several disorders that may be associated with pain or 
functional impairment. Special attention should be paid to the paravertebral 
muscles during imaging, so that a possible muscular disease is not overlooked, 
especially in patients with low back pain. This article reviews such imaging 
abnormalities.

New horizons in pharmacologic treatment for rheumatic disease pain.

QC H4S 1Z9, Canada.

Chronic pain is the major concern for patients with rheumatic diseases, such as 
low back pain, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, but current therapies 
are suboptimal. Animal models and emerging clinical data indicate that there is 
a complex spectrum of neurologic changes, manifesting both nociceptive and 
neuropathic pain, which are driven by joint pathophysiology and abnormal 
excitability in peripheral and central pain pathways. A variety of mechanisms 
and molecular drivers have been identified that can support future segmentation 
of musculoskeletal pain patients. Emerging therapies are directed to targeting 
inflammatory mediators, ligand and voltage regulated ion channels, as well as 
increasing inhibition through monoaminergic modulation. Finally, neurotrophic 
abnormalities may be restored through the modulation of specific neurotrophins. 
These developments are supported by increasing emphasis on the clinical 
understanding of the neurologic changes in pain patients to enable confident 
translation to clinical application.

Confirmation of needle placement within the piriformis muscle of a cadaveric 
specimen using anatomic landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance.

Of patients presenting to pain clinics, complaints are of low back or buttock 
pain with or without radicular leg symptoms is one of the most common. 
Piriformis syndrome may be a contributor in up to 8% of these patients. The 
mainstay of treatment is conservative management with physical therapy, 
anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxants, and correction of biomechanical 
abnormalities. However, in recalcitrant cases, a piriformis injection of 
anesthetic and/or corticosteroids may be considered. Because of its small size, 
proximity to neurovascular structures, and deep location, the piriformis muscle 
is often injected with the use of commuted tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), fluoroscopy, electrical stimulators, or 
electromyography (EMG). Numerous techniques have been proposed using one or a 
combination of the above modalities. However, application of these techniques is 
limited by unavailability of CT, MRI, and EMG equipment as well as a paucity of 
trained physicians in US-guided procedures in many pain treatment centers 
throughout the United States. Fluoroscopy, however, is more widely available in 
this setting. This study utilized a cadaveric specimen to confirm proper needle 
placement for piriformis or peri-sciatic injection utilizing the previously 
documented landmarks for fluoroscopic guidance as described by Betts. An 
anteroposterior of the pelvis with inclusion of the acetabular region of the hip 
and the inferior aspect of the sacroiliac joint was obtained. The most 
superior-lateral aspect of the acetabulum and the inferior aspect of the 
sacroiliac joint were identified. A marker was placed one-third of the distance 
from the acetabular location to the inferior sacroiliac joint, indicating the 
target location. A 22-gauge, 3.5-inch spinal needle was directed through the 
gluteal muscles to the target location using intermittent fluoroscopic guidance. 
The posterior ileum was contacted and the needle was withdrawn 1 -2 mm. This 
approach found the needle within the piriformis muscle belly 2 -3 cm lateral to 
sciatic nerve. The present study was the first study, to our knowledge, that has 
confirmed the intramuscular position of the needle within the piriformis muscle 
of a cadaveric specimen using these anatomic landmarks and fluoroscopic 
guidance.

Accuracy of MRI for diagnosis of discogenic pain.

(1)California Spine Diagnostics, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA. 
coneill@sbcglobal.net

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have compared MRI parameters to the results from 
discography. However, none have evaluated the overall diagnostic performance of 
MRI, taking into account that many MRI characteristics may be correlated.
OBJECTIVE: Determine the accuracy of MRI for diagnosis of discogenic pain, 
taking into consideration the interdependence of MRI parameters.
STUDY DESIGN: An observational report.
SETTING: Sample of 143 patients, 92 male and 51 female in a spinal pain 
speciality center. Discography classification and scorings for MRI parameters 
were collected as outcome measures.
METHODS: MRI and discography data were collected from patients with chronic low 
back pain. Five MRI characteristics were defined: high intensity zone, nuclear 
signal, disc height, disc contour, and bone marrow intensity change. On 
discography, each disc was classified as either positive or negative. The 
accuracy of MRI was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: MRI parameters are correlated with each other and with discography 
findings, and these correlations affect the accuracy of MRI. Overall, nuclear 
signal alone is as accurate as any of the other MRI parameters, or combination 
of parameters, in the diagnosis of discogenic pain. While there is no difference 
in overall accuracy between nuclear signal and the other MRI parameters, these 
parameters do influence test performance when there is a moderate loss of 
nuclear signal. Moderate loss of nuclear signal and disc bulge has the best 
combination of sensitivity (79.8%) and specificity (79.3%). Adding moderate loss 
of disc height improves specificity (82.0%) slightly, and decreases sensitivity 
(73.6%) slightly, while incorporating high intensity zone grade II further 
improves specificity (92.6%) and decreases sensitivity (54.7%). High intensity 
zone grade I and bone marrow intensity change have minimal influence, even when 
there is moderate loss of nuclear signal.
CONCLUSIONS: MRI parameters are correlated with each other and with discography 
findings, influencing the diagnostic performance of MRI. Combining MRI 
parameters improves the diagnostic performance of MRI, but only in the presence 
of moderate loss of nuclear signal. When there is either normal nuclear signal 
or severe loss of nuclear signal the other MRI parameters have no influence on 
test performance. The practical implication for physicians that use discography 
is that the most important single MRI parameter to consider is nuclear signal. 
If nuclear signal is normal the disc is very likely to be negative on 
discography, while if there is severe loss of nuclear signal it is very likely 
to be positive. Discography will be most useful in discs with moderate loss of 
nuclear signal, particularly if there are no other MRI abnormalities present.

Author information:
(1)Healing Our Village, Inc., Lanham, Md., USA. jrgavin3@yahoo.com

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications must be managed by using a 
comprehensive, or global, approach to treatment. The author describes the case 
of a white man, aged 51 years, with T2DM that was diagnosed 3 years earlier. The 
patient was obese and had a history of chronic low back pain. He also had 
diagnosed hypertension, decreased vibratory sensation in the feet, an S4 atrial 
gallop, trace ankle edema, degenerative joint disease in the knees, and 
decreased range of motion in the lumbar spine. Other findings at the patient's 
initial visit included hyperglycemia, microalbuminuria, and lipid abnormalities. 
Initial treatment included metformin; a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(naproxen); a thiazolidinedione (rosiglitazone maleate); a thiazide diuretic 
(hydrochlorothiazide); an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril); 
and low-dose aspirin. At 6-month follow-up, the patient continued to have 
elevated glycosylated hemoglobin, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and excess weight. 
Additional treatment strategies consisted of pioglitazone hydrochloride; 
metformin in combination with the dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor sitagliptin 
phosphate; a statin (atorvastatin hydrochloride); and enrollment in a diet and 
exercise program. Results at 12-month follow-up included a substantial decrease 
in glycosylated hemoglobin and improved hypertension and dyslipidemia. The 
patient was successfully treated across the full range of global cardiovascular 
risk reduction.

Spontaneous septic diskitis: a common complaint with a serious pathologic cause 
that should not been overlooked.

Many people who have low back pain are likely to be out of work and taking 
medication and probably make demands on both primary and secondary health care 
as well as the private sector. Septic diskitis is a rare cause of back pain, 
accounting for less than 0.01% of cases in the primary care setting (Carragee 
EJ. Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1997;79:874-80). It 
has been associated with a high morbidity and mortality in the past. Although it 
is an unusual complication in a postoperative patient, it is even more rare in a 
nonoperative patient. It accounts for 2% of all osteomyelitis (Maiuri F, 
Iaconetta G, Gallicchio B, Manto A, Briganti F. Spondylodiscitis. Clinical and 
magnetic resonance diagnosis. Spine. 1997;22:1741-6) and may occur 
spontaneously, after surgery (especially after epidural anesthesia), in the 
immunosuppressed, and systemic infections. It has the potential to be an 
orthopedic pitfall in the emergency department because it can be presented with 
nonspecific symptoms, nonspecific laboratory abnormalities, and nondiagnostic 
radiographic studies. We present a case of low back pain in a previously healthy 
individual as a result of spontaneous septic diskitis, which had been initially 
misdiagnosed in the private sector as herniation of an intervertebral disk.

A 41-year-old man presented with low-velocity gunshot injury in the right 
abdomen. Neuroimaging showed the bullet located in the L2-3 intervertebral disc 
space, but neurological examination found no abnormalities. Exploratory 
laparotomy was performed because of retroperitoneal hematoma. Two months after 
the gunshot injury, the patient presented with severe low back pain. Serial 
neuroimaging showed that the bullet had migrated in the intervertebral disc 
space. The bullet was removed via right L2 hemilaminectomy. The patient had no 
complaints after the operation. Early recognition and surgical intervention for 
bullets embedded in the intervertebral disc space may present with neurological 
and related complications.

MS 39216, USA.

The 80,000 or so patients a year who continue to have chronic, disabling back 
pain after one or more spinal surgeries are said to have failed back surgery 
syndrome. There are no controlled studies to guide physicians in the management 
of these patients. Six anatomical abnormalities of the spine most commonly 
result in back surgery, and 7 undesirable outcomes lead to failed back surgery 
syndrome. On the basis of 5 large retrospective studies and our clinical 
experience, we suggest a systematic approach to these patients. This approach is 
focused on determination of the specific anatomical abnormality responsible for 
ongoing symptoms, an abnormality that may or may not be related to the initial 
abnormality for which surgery was performed. One or more of 5 nonsurgical 
treatment options may be useful to prevent the need for further surgery, as each 
subsequent surgery has a lower likelihood of success.

Medicine, Institute of Health Biosciences, Tokushima, Japan.

AIM: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic nephropexy for 
symptomatic nephrotosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2000 and December 2005, 6 women (mean age, 
43.1 years) underwent laparoscopic nephropexy of 8 kidneys (6 right, 2 left). 
Mean body mass index was 19.6 kg/m(2). Two patients displayed ureteropelvic 
junction obstruction (UPJO). Preoperative evaluation was performed by 
intravenous urography (IVU) and isotope renography in both the supine and erect 
positions. Four patients (6 renal units) underwent retroperitoneoscopic 
nephropexy, with a dismembered pyeloplasty in 1 patient (1 renal unit). The 
transperitoneal approach was performed in 2 patients, the first case and another 
with UPJO due to an aberrant vessel. The kidney was mobilized, then fixed to the 
back muscles with nonabsorbable sutures.
RESULTS: Mean operative time was 139.4 minutes (range, 95-200), and mean blood 
loss was 30 mL (range, 10-60). No perioperative complications were encountered. 
Mean hospital stay was 6.4 days. Postoperative IVU and isotope renography 
correctly confirmed a fixed kidney and no obstruction in the UPJO cases. All 
patients reported a symptomatic improvement during follow-up (range, 11-81 
months).
CONCLUSIONS: As pain is the presenting symptom in these cases, a laparoscopic 
approach seems to represent the gold standard for treatment owing to low 
morbidity and good cosmetic results.

Routine electrodiagnosis and a multiparameter technique in lumbosacral 
radiculopathies.

Fisher MA(1), Bajwa R, Somashekar KN.

Author information:
(1)Hines VAH, Hines, IL 60141, USA. morris.fisher@med.va.gov

OBJECTIVE: This study compares Routine nerve conductions studies (NCS)/needle 
electromyography (nEMG) with a multiparameter recording method (NC-stat; 
NeuroMetrix Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathies 
(LSR).
METHODS: Charts from 34 consecutive patients with a clinical history and/or 
examination consistent with an LSR were retrospectively reviewed. All underwent 
both Routine NCS/nEMG studies and NC-stat EDX. NC-stat testing included peroneal 
and posterior tibial nerve distal motor latencies and amplitudes and F-wave 
analysis. Twenty-eight patients had magnetic resonance imaging of the 
lumbosacral spine, and two had post-myelogram computerized tomography scan.
RESULTS: In the 24 patients with abnormal routine NCS/nEMG, NC-stat EDX was 
abnormal in 22. Raw agreement values between specific abnormal Routine and 
NC-stat EDX parameters ranged from 065 to 0.76. NC-stat amplitude and F-wave 
data provide reasonable electrodiagnostic 'rule in, rule out' information for 
LSR. Routine and NC-stat EDX had comparable positive and negative likelihood 
ratios with radiographic findings based on blinded neuroradiological evaluation. 
This included good 'stand alone' values for NC-stat F-wave and compound muscle 
action potential (CMAP) amplitude abnormalities in patients with spinal 
stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This report supports the value of multiparameter clinical 
neurophysiological evaluations in patients with LSR including CMAPs and F-waves.

We present a male subject with interposed bone tissue between L5-S1 levels. We 
performed a bibliographic search and we did not find a case like this one. The 
objective of this work is to report this finding, so it could be considered as a 
cause of low back pain and hypogastrium pain.
CASE REPORT: Male, irrelevant clinical history presenting with pain in 
hypogastrium during physical exertion. We found a bone between L5-S1 on simple 
X-rays. He was treated with NSAID's and improved on symptoms.
DISCUSSION: We performed a search of similar cases, and did not find data as in 
our case. This case report will permit to associate to similar problems, and to 
define if it is a clinical entity with its own characteristics.

Psychophysical and neurochemical abnormalities of pain processing in 
fibromyalgia.

University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610-0221, USA. staudr@ufl.edu

Fibromyalgia pain is frequent in the general population, but its pathogenesis is 
only partially understood. Patients with fibromyalgia lack consistent tissue 
abnormalities but display features of hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to 
painful stimuli) and allodynia (lowered pain threshold). Many recent 
fibromyalgia studies have demonstrated central nervous system (CNS) pain 
processing abnormalities, including abnormal temporal summation of pain. In the 
CNS, persistent nociceptive input from peripheral tissues can lead to 
neuroplastic changes resulting in central sensitization and pain. This mechanism 
appears to represent a hallmark of fibromyalgia and many other chronic pain 
syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular disorder, 
migraine, and low back pain. Importantly, after central sensitization has been 
established, only minimal peripheral input is required for the maintenance of 
the chronic pain state. Additional factors, including pain-related negative 
affect and poor sleep have been shown to significantly contribute to clinical 
fibromyalgia pain. Better understanding of these mechanisms and their 
relationship to central sensitization and clinical pain will provide new 
approaches for the prevention and treatment of fibromyalgia and other chronic 
pain syndromes.

Missed lumbar disc herniations diagnosed with kinetic magnetic resonance 
imaging.

Zou J(1), Yang H, Miyazaki M, Wei F, Hong SW, Yoon SH, Morishita Y, Wang JC.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow 
University, Suzhou, China.

STUDY DESIGN: A novel dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, kinetic 
MRI (kMRI), was used to study lumbar disc herniations.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if adding flexion and 
extension MRI studies to the traditional neutral views would be beneficial in 
the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniations.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior studies demonstrate that only 70% of patients 
with lumbar disc herniations based on physical examinations are confirmed by MRI 
studies. Recently, kMRI delivers the ability to scan patients in neutral, 
flexion, and extension positions, which may allow for improved diagnosis of this 
problem.
METHODS: Five hundred fifty-three patients underwent kMRI with assessment of the 
degree of disc bulge in neutral and flexion and extension. The images were 
analyzed using computer measurement technology to objectively quantify the 
amount of disc herniation.
RESULTS: For patients with normal or <3 mm of disc bulge in neutral, 19.46% 
demonstrated an increase in herniation to >3 mm bulge in extension, and 15.29% 
demonstrated an increase to >3 mm bulge in flexion. For patients in the neutral 
view that had a baseline disc bulge of 3 to 5 mm, 13.28% had increased 
herniations to >5 mm in extension and 8.47% had increased herniations to >5 mm 
in flexion. For patients with a baseline disc bulge of 5 to 7 mm in neutral, 
10.58% increased in extension and 5.78% increased in flexion. In addition, for 
patients with a baseline disc bulge of 7 to 9 mm in neutral, 9.09% increased in 
extension and 4.55% increased in flexion.
CONCLUSION: A significant increase in the degree of lumbar disc herniation was 
found by examining flexion and extension views when compared with neutral views 
alone. kMRI views provide valuable added information, especially in situations 
where symptomatic radiculopathy is present without any abnormalities 
demonstrated on conventional MRI.

The myth of lumbar instability: the importance of abnormal loading as a cause of 
low back pain.

Mulholland RC(1).

Author information:
(1)Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, Nottingham, UK. mulhollandrcm@aol.com

Spinal fusion became what has been termed the "gold standard" for the treatment 
of mechanical low back pain, yet there was no scientific basis for this. 
Operations of fusion for low back pain were initially done at the beginning of 
the last century for back pain thought to be related to congenital abnormalities 
or for past spinal infection. The recognition of the disc as a cause of 
sciatica, commonly associated with back pain, and the recognition that a 
degenerate disc led to abnormal movement suggested the concept that this 
abnormal movement was the cause of pain, and this abnormal movement came to be 
called "instability". Much biomechanical expertise confirmed the fact that 
degenerate discs led to abnormal movement, there were many hypothesis as to why 
this caused pain. However clinical results of fusion for back pain were 
unpredictable. The failure of pedicle screws and cage fusion to improve the 
clinical results of fusion despite near 100% fusion success, and the 
introduction of "flexible stabilization" and artificial discs, which 
demonstrated that despite the often unpredictable movement permitted by of these 
devices, clinical success was similar to fusion, directed attention to the other 
role of the disc, that of load transfer, which these devices also affected. 
Abnormal load transfer was already known to be critical in other joints in the 
body and had led to the use of osteotomy to realign joints. The relevance of 
load transfer to the future design of spinal implants used in the treatment of 
low back pain is discussed, and some finite element studies are reported 
demonstrating the likely effect of abnormal loading beneath an incompletely 
incorporated plate of an artificial disc, perhaps explaining in part the 
somewhat disappointing clinical results to date of the implantation of 
artificial discs.

Non-specific low-back pain (LBP) should de differentiated from symptomatic LBP, 
attributed to recognisable, known specific pathology (e.g. tumour, infection, 
inflammatory disease...). The initial clinical history taking should aim at 
identifying "red flags", associated with a higher risk of serious disorders. 
Rapid MRI of the spine should be performed in order to make a specific 
diagnosis. In chronic LBP, X-rays of the spine are always performed, first to 
rule out underlying specific diagnosis, then to describe degenerative spine 
changes. At MRI and X-rays, most of degenerative disc abnormalities are 
non-specific, frequently found in the asymptomatic subjects. On fat-suppressed 
T2WI, edema of endplates in degenerative disc disease and of posterior arches in 
facet arthropathy and spondylolysis is well-correlated to LBP. Such edema may be 
useful to guide the treatment.

A MRI of the lumbal spine was performed on a patient with lumbago. Besides the 
fact of no evidence for a myelopathy caused by a herniated disc a both-sided 
iliac vein thrombosis could be seen. In further examination the coincidence of a 
congenital absence of vena cava inferior with distinctive collateral vessel 
systems over lumbal and spinal veins and heterozygosis for Factor V Leiden 
abnormality could be identified as cause for thrombosis. It is very likely that 
symptoms developed as a result of spinal vein hyperplasia and consecutive myelon 
compression.

Voltage-gated potassium channel antibody (VGKC-Ab)-associated limbic 
encephalitis (LE) is a recently described syndrome that broadens the spectrum of 
immunotherapy-responsive central nervous system disorders. Limbic encephalitis 
is typically characterised by a sub-acute onset of disorientation, amnesia and 
seizures, but the clinical spectrum is not yet fully defined and the syndrome 
could be under-diagnosed. We here describe the clinical profile of four patients 
with VGKC-Ab-associated LE who had intermittent, episodic hypothermia. One of 
the patients also described a prodrome of severe neuropathic pain preceding the 
development of limbic symptoms. Both of these novel symptoms responded well to 
immunosuppressive therapy, with concurrent amelioration of amnesia/seizures.

Netherlands. j.verbunt@srl.nl

BACKGROUND: Patients with fibromyalgia often feel disabled in the performance of 
daily activities. Psychological factors seem to play a pronounced disabling role 
in fibromyalgia. The objectives of the study are: Firstly, to investigate 
contributing factors for disability in fibromyalgia. Secondly, to study 
psychological distress in patients with fibromyalgia as compared to other 
nonspecific pain syndromes. And finally, to explore the impact of fibromyalgia 
on a patient's quality of life.
METHODS: In this cross sectional study, explaining factors for disability were 
studied based on a regression analysis with gender, mental health, physical and 
social functioning as independent variables. For the assessment of disability in 
fibromyalgia the FIQ was used. The levels of psychological distress in patients 
with fibromyalgia, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) and chronic low back 
pain (CLBP) were compared based on scores on the Symptom Checklist (SCL90). 
Quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia was compared with scores (SF36) of 
both patients with fibromyalgia and other health conditions as derived from the 
literature.
RESULTS: Disability in fibromyalgia seemed best explained by a patients mental 
health condition (beta = -0.360 p = 0.02). The level of psychological distress 
was higher in patients with fibromyalgia as compared to patients with CRPS or 
CLBP (p < 0.01). The impact of fibromyalgia on quality of life appeared to be 
high as compared to the impact of other health conditions.
CONCLUSION: Patients with fibromyalgia report a considerable impact on their 
quality of life and their perceived disability level seems influenced by their 
mental health condition. In comparison with patients with other pain conditions 
psychological distress is higher.

The role of PET/CT in evaluation of Facet and Disc abnormalities in patients 
with low back pain using (18)F-Fluoride.

Gamie S(1), El-Maghraby T.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiotherapy, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.

BACKGROUND: Bone scintigraphy including Single Photon Emission Computed 
Tomography (SPECT) is known for its role in the diagnosis of low back pain 
disorders. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with (18)F (Flouride-18) as a 
tracer can be used to carry out bone scans with improved image quality. With the 
addition of CT, simultaneous PET/CT fused images provide more accurate 
anatomical details. The objectives of this work are to assess the use of 
(18)F-PET/CT in patients with back pain and suspected facetogenic pain, and to 
find the frequency of facet arthropathy versus disc disease abnormalities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 67 patients who presented with back pain underwent routine 
X-ray, CT and/or MRI, which failed to identify a clear cause, were referred to 
(18)F-PET/CT. Among the main group, a subset of 25 patients had previous spine 
surgery consisting of laminectomy or discectomy (17 patients) and lumbar fusion 
(8 patients). The PET/CT scan was acquired on a GE VCT 64-Slice combined 
scanner. Imaging started 45-60 minutes after administration of 12-15 mCi 
(444-555 MBq) of (18)F-Fluoride. The PET scan was acquired from the skull base 
through the inguinal region in 3D mode at 2 minutes/bed. A lowresolution, 
non-contrast CT scan was also acquired for anatomic localization and attenuation 
correction.
RESULTS: The (18)F-PET/CT showed abnormal uptake in the spine in 56 patients, 
with an overall detection ability of 84%. Facet joints as a cause of back pain 
was much more frequent (25 with abnormal scans). One-third (36%) of the patients 
showed multiple positive uptake in both facet joints and disc areas (20/56). The 
patients were further divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 42 patients 
(63%) with back pain and no previous operative procedures, and the (18)F-PET/CT 
showed a high sensitivity (88%) in identifying the source of pain in 37/42 
patients. Group B included 25 patients (37%) with prior lumbar fusion or 
laminectomy, in which the PET/CT showed positive uptake in 76% (19/25 patients). 
(18)F-PET/CT showed positive uptake in all patients (100%) with a history of 
pain after lumbar fusion, while in the laminectomy subgroup only 11 cases (65%) 
showed positive focal uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-PET/CT has a potential use in evaluating adult patients with 
back pain. It has a promising role in identifying causes of persistent back pain 
following vertebral surgical interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical findings in a case of premature ductal 
constriction associated with maternal use of nimesulide, a cyclo-oxygenase 
type-2 inhibitor.
METHODS: Case report.
RESULTS: A mother self-administered nimesulide at 39 weeks of gestation due to 
lower back pain. Less than 24 h later premature ductal constriction was 
diagnosed by echocardiography following a suspicious fetal heart rate recording 
with baseline tachycardia and absent accelerations.
CONCLUSION: In a term pregnancy, nimesulide administration can rapidly cause 
premature ductal constriction. This condition may induce abnormalities in the 
fetal heart rate trace.

Calcifying fibrous (pseudo) tumour (CFP) is an uncommon and distinct 
pathological entity, which is usually occurring in the soft tissue of the 
extremities, trunk, axilla, pleura, mediastinum and peritoneum. We report a case 
of CFP of the adrenal gland. A 29-years-old previously healthy woman complained 
the left lumbago. A solid mass was found on computed tomography on the left 
adrenal gland. There were no abnormalities in physical examination and 
laboratory studies. Only urinary noradrenalines and dopamines levels were 
slightly high. Laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed. Pathological 
findings of the left adrenal tumor showed dense hyalinized fibrous tissue 
containing bland spindle-shaped cells, calcifications, and lymphoplasmacytic 
infiltrate. Our case seems to be the first case of CFP to be published in the 
Japanese literature.

Academy, Etlik-Ankara, Turkey. iltekinduman@yahoo.com

A 21-year-old male patient with low back pain and marked forward bending was 
presented. The exaggerated lumbar flexion was preventing him to stand in erect 
posture but disappeared while lying. The symptoms had begun after he had lifted 
a heavy object. Straight-leg-raising test could not be performed properly 
because of the exaggerated pain. The light-touch sense was decreased on L5 and 
S1 dermatomes. There was no loss of muscle strength. The deep-tendon reflexes 
were normal. Plain graph showed mild narrowing in the L4-5 and L5-S1 
intervertebral spaces. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed disc 
protrusions in L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. During his stay in the department, the 
patient was given tizanidine and tramadol, and physical therapy was performed. A 
paravertebral intramuscular injection with lidocaine was applied. Moreover, the 
patient was referred to psychiatrist for evaluation regarding his medical 
history of conversive seizures and possible efforts for secondary gain. No 
response was obtained from all the treatments. The final diagnosis was 
camptocormia triggered by lumbar-disc herniation. He was applied supportive 
psychotherapy, psychoeducation regarding secondary gain, strong suggestions to 
improve posture, positive reinforcement, and behavioral therapy. His postural 
abnormality resolved and disappeared completely with mild pain.

The clinical significance of lumbosacral transitional anomalies.

Bron JL(1), van Royen BJ, Wuisman PI.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, 
The Netherlands.

Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) are common congenital anomalies of the 
human spine. In LSTV, either the fifth lumbar vertebra may show assimilation to 
the sacrum (sacralisation), or the first sacral vertebra may show transition to 
a lumbar configuration (lumbarisation). Although the condition has an incidence 
of over 12% in the general population, knowledge about the exact clinical 
implications is still lacking. The association between LSTV and low back pain 
has been debated since it was first described by Bertolotti almost a century 
ago. Furthermore, several conflicting studies have been published regarding the 
association of LSTV with other spinal pathology. There seems to be a relation 
with early disc degeneration above the LSTV in young patients. However, these 
differences fade with age as they are masked by other degenerative changes of 
the spine. From a practical view-point, failure to recognise and to number LSTV 
during spinal surgery may have serious consequences.

STUDY DESIGN: A histologic, biologic, and immunohistochemical assessment using 
human samples of lumbar ligamentum flavum.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the pathomechanism of loss of elasticity and hypertrophy 
of the lumbar ligamentum flavum (LF) in the elderly population.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The most common spinal disorder in elderly patients 
is lumbar spinal canal stenosis, causing low back and leg pain, and paresis. 
Canal narrowing, in part, results from hypertrophy of the LF. Although 
histologic and biologic literature on this topic is available, the 
pathomechanism of loss of elasticity and hypertrophy of the LF is still unknown.
METHODS: One fetus, 5 young, and 5 elderly LF were obtained for histologic 
study. Hematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue, Masson Trichrome, and Elastica Van 
Gieson stains were performed for each LF. Nine LF were collected and were used 
for biologic study of real time RT-PCR to quantitatively measure mRNA expression 
of Type I collagen and elastin in each LF.
RESULTS: In the LF of the fetus, elastic fibers accounted for about 75% of the 
entire area. In the dural aspect of the LF in the young and elderly group, the 
ratio was also around 75%; however, the ratio of the dorsal aspect decreased 
with age. Almost half of the area showing loss of elastic fibers was shown to be 
converted to cartilaginous tissue producing Type II collagen and proteoglycan by 
Alcian blue and Type II collagen immunohistochemistry. The area, which did not 
stain black with EV nor blue with AB stain, was positively stained blue with T 
stain, indicating scarring. The area of the normal dural layer was 18.0 +/- 2.3 
and 33.8 +/- 4.3 (mm2), for young and elderly group, respectively. Accordingly, 
it was 3.2 +/- 0.8 and 18.0 +/- 10.2 (mm2), for the dorsal abnormal layer. 
Elastin mRNA showed a relatively strong correlation (r = 0.44) with age; 
however, the slope was very gentle. Type I collagen mRNA showed a very strong 
correlation (r = 0.80) with age. The slope was steeper, and the value reached at 
1000% (10-fold) around 65 years old when compared with the LF from younger 
patient. Elastin mRNA showed a weak correlation (r = 0.36) with thickness, and 
the slope was gentle. Type I collagen mRNA showed relatively strong correlation 
(r = 0.52) with thickness. The slope was steeper, and the line reached at 1000% 
(10-fold) around 6.5 (mm) when compared with a thin LF.
CONCLUSION: Decreased elasticity of LF in the elderly is due to the loss of 
elastic fibers and a concomitant increase of collagenous fibers in the dorsal 
aspect. LF hypertrophy could be due to the thickening of the normal elastic 
layer as well as of the abnormal collagenous layer.

Summary for patients in
    Am Fam Physician. 2007 Nov 15;76(10):1504.

As many as 90 percent of persons with occupational nonspecific low back pain are 
able to return to work in a relatively short period of time. As long as no "red 
flags" exist, the patient should be encouraged to remain as active as possible, 
minimize bed rest, use ice or heat compresses, take anti-inflammatory or 
analgesic medications if desired, participate in home exercises, and return to 
work as soon as possible. Medical and surgical intervention should be minimized 
when abnormalities on physical examination are lacking and the patient is having 
difficulty returning to work after four to six weeks. Personal and occupational 
psychosocial factors should be addressed thoroughly, and a multidisciplinary 
rehabilitation program should be strongly considered to prevent delayed recovery 
and chronic disability. Patient advocacy should include preventing unnecessary 
and ineffective medical and surgical interventions, prolonged work loss, 
joblessness, and chronic disability.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of a specific population.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and coprevalence of nonspecific low 
back pain (nsLBP) and lumbar radiological abnormalities (LRA) in judo athletes.
BACKGROUND: nsLBP and LRA occur frequently in judo athletes. High body mass has 
been reported to be associated with both nsLBP and LRA.
METHODS AND MEASURES: The subjects comprised 82 male judo athletes (mean +/- SD 
age, 20.1 +/- 0.9 years) from 3 weight categories: lightweight (n = 29), 
middleweight (n= 31), and heavyweight (n = 22). The presence of nsLBP was 
evaluated using a questionnaire. LRA were examined using plain-film radiographs 
and magnetic resonance imaging. The prevalence of nsLBP and LRA were compared 
among weight categories.
RESULTS: The prevalence of nsLBP in the lightweight, middleweight, and 
heavyweight categories was 34.5%, 32.3%, and 40.9%, respectively. For LRA, 
prevalence for the 3 weight categories was 65.5%, 90.3%, and 90.9%, respectively 
(middle-weight and heavyweight greater prevalence than lightweight [P<.05]). The 
prevalence of LRA in athletes with nsLBP in each category was 50.0%, 100%, and 
88.9%, respectively (middleweight greater prevalence than lightweight [P<.05]). 
The prevalence of LRA in athletes without nsLBP in each category was 73.7%, 
85.7%, and 92.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LRA was approximately 90% in the middleweight and 
heavyweight categories, which was greater than for the lightweight category. 
There was a large coprevalence of nsLBP and LRA. However, many judo athletes 
without nsLBP had LRA. The presence of LRA may not have a direct association 
with nsLBP.

Epidural venous enlargements presenting with intractable lower back pain and 
sciatica in a patient with absence of the infrarenal inferior vena cava and 
bilateral deep venous thrombosis.

STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
OBJECTIVE: To present a rare anomaly of the inferior vena cava associated with 
radicular pain and to illustrate its imaging characteristics.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Irritation of the trigeminal nerve by vascular 
anomalies, resulting in neuralgia is a well-recognized entity. Recently, 
compression of peripheral nerve roots due to enlarged epidural venous plexus has 
been described as a possible cause of back and radicular pain, too.
METHODS: A 26-year-old man presented with acute exacerbation of lower back pain 
associated with radiculopathy down his left thigh. On radiologic workup, a 
prolapse of a lumbar intervertebral disc was ruled out, but agenesis of the 
infrarenal segment of the inferior vena cava was found, which has caused 
bilateral deep venous thrombosis. Venous flow was redirected mainly via enlarged 
lumbar epidural, ascending lumbar, and paravertebral veins.
RESULTS: No associated congenital heart or abdominal organ defects were found 
and screening for thrombophilia was negative. The patient was successfully 
treated with anticoagulation under which symptoms gradually resolved.
CONCLUSION: The authors believe that epidural venous enlargements should be 
considered as a cause of radicular and/or back pain in patients with anomalies 
of the inferior vena cava, because pathologic processes compressing nervous 
structures can cause pain.

Acute spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma presenting as paraplegia: a rare 
case.

Author information:

Hospital, Oswestry, UK. athkyriaky@yahoo.com

STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
OBJECTIVES: To report an unusual case of spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma 
and to review relevant literature and discuss the etiology, pathogenesis, 
clinical features, imaging, and prognosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma with no 
underline pathology is a very rare condition. Only 19 cases have been previously 
reported.
METHODS: The case of a 44-year-old man is presented. Pubmed (Medline) was used 
to search publications.
RESULTS: Our patient presented with sudden severe low back pain following a 
minimal effort, with rapid onset of complete paraplegia. MRI revealed an 
anterior subdural hematoma from T2-T6 with cord compression. An urgent 
laminectomy was performed. MRI scan, surgery, and CT angiogram did not reveal 
any underlying pathology to account for the subdural hematoma. The patient 
demonstrated substantial clinical improvement after 6 weeks of bed rest and 
intense rehabilitation program.
CONCLUSION: Spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) is uncommon and can be caused by 
abnormalities of coagulation, blood dyscrasias, or trauma, underlying neoplasm, 
and arteriovenous malformation. SSDH is very rare in the absence of these 
underlying conditions. It occurs most commonly in the thoracic spine and 
presents with sudden back pain radiating to the arms, legs or trunk, varying 
degrees of motor, sensory, and autonomic disturbances. On MRI, SSDH is seen as a 
space-occupying lesion, usually ventrally, contained within the dura matter, and 
can demonstrate variable T1 and T2 signal depending on the age of the hematoma. 
The prognosis is variable. The majority of cases in the literature had surgical 
decompression, although cases that were managed conservatively have been 
reported to be successful as well. The indications of surgery need to be 
clarified.

Pedicle stress fracture: an unusual complication of pycnodysostosis.

Pycnodysostosis is a rare dysplasia characterised by high bone density and 
susceptibility to long bone fractures caused by cathepsin K deficiency. Spinal 
abnormalities have rarely been described in this uncommon inherited bone 
dysplasia. A 28-year-old female, with a past history of pycnodysostosis and 
spontaneous leg fractures was hospitalized for a 2-month history of spontaneous 
low back pain. Physical examination revealed the typical facial and hand 
features of pycnodysostosis and local lumbar stiffness. No abnormalities were 
found in laboratory tests, particularly with regard to bone turnover markers. 
Fracture of the left pedicle of the third lumbar vertebra was suspected on 
lumbar radiographs and later confirmed by a computed tomography (CT) scan. A 
dramatic improvement in symptoms was achieved, thanks to a course of injectable 
calcitonin therapy and rest. To our knowledge, it is the first-ever reported 
case of pedicle stress fracture in a patient with pycnodysostosis, suggesting 
that spontaneous fractures resulting from this bone dysplasia do not only affect 
diaphysis of brittle long bones but could also affect the lumbar spine. 
Furthermore, the present case confirms previous observations in such patients of 
frequent spondylolysis, which could lead to abnormal lumbar pedicle stress. The 
dramatic improvement achieved by calcitonin therapy might be related to 
osteoclastic dysfunction in pycnodysostosis caused by a deficiency of cathepsin 
K, a cystein protease involved in bone matrix remodelling.

Bed rest has been shown to be an ineffective treatment for non-specific low back 
pain (LBP). Despite this, during a new episode of pain some patients still rely 
on bed rest. Which patients choose bed rest is however unknown. The objectives 
of the present study were, firstly, to assess characteristics of patients 
choosing bed rest in (sub)acute pain and secondly to study whether prolonged bed 
rest in the (sub)acute phase of pain will result in long term disability. A 
prospective longitudinal cohort study included 282 patients with non-specific 
LBP for less than 7 weeks. Main outcome measures were duration of bed rest (in 
three categories) and disability. Results showed that 33% of patients with 
(sub)acute LBP had bed rest, but only 8% stayed in bed for more than four days. 
An ordinal regression analysis revealed that behavioural factors 
(catastrophizing (OR=1.05 per bed rest category p<0.01)) and fear of injury 
(OR=1.05 per category p<0.01) rather than specific pain related factors (pain 
history (OR=0.61 per category p=0.16) and pain intensity (OR=1.00 per category 
p=0.63)) were associated with bed rest. Patients with prolonged bed rest in an 
early phase of pain were still more disabled after one year (p<0.01). Based on 
these results we conclude that prolonged bed rest in the early phase of pain is 
associated with a higher long term disability level. In preventing low back 
disability, GP screening for catastrophizing and fear of injury in LBP patients 
who had prolonged bed rest merits consideration.

Reduction mammaplasty: a significant improvement at any size.

Spector JA(1), Karp NS.

University, NY, USA.

BACKGROUND: Reduction mammaplasty has been shown to be efficacious in reducing 
the burden of symptoms and improving the quality of life for patients with 
macromastia. However, most insurance carriers will not reimburse for 
mammaplasties involving less than 1000 g of total tissue resected. To refute 
this arbitrary policy, the authors set out to examine the effect of reduction 
mammaplasty in which less than 1000 g of breast tissue was resected on patients' 
macromastia-related symptoms and macromastia-related quality-of-life factors.
METHODS: All patients were given a custom-designed questionnaire designed to 
evaluate macromastia-related symptoms and other macromastia-related 
quality-of-life issues. Patients were then provided the same questionnaire at 
their final postoperative visit between 3 and 12 months after surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 59 patients underwent reduction mammaplasty of less than 
1000 g. Reduction mammaplasty less than 1000 g resulted in significant decreases 
in all macromastia-related symptoms analyzed, including upper back pain, lower 
back pain, neck pain, arm pain, shoulder pain, hand pain, breast pain, 
headaches, rashes, and/or itching and painful bra strap grooving (all p < 
0.00002). Furthermore, reduction mammaplasty resulted in significant improvement 
in all quality-of-life factors analyzed, including difficulty buying clothes and 
bras, difficulty participating in sports, and difficulty running (all p < 
0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduction mammaplasty totaling less than 1000 g offers substantial 
relief of macromastia-associated symptoms and results in significant improvement 
in patients' quality of life. This prospective study conclusively demonstrates 
that reduction mammaplasty totaling less than 1000 g should be a fully 
reimbursable procedure.

The role of sacroiliac joint dysfunction in the genesis of low back pain: the 
obvious is not always right.

Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer 
Sheva, Israel. weksler@bgumail.bgu.ac.il

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: It is a common practice to the link low back pain with 
protruding disc even when neurological signs are absent. Because pain caused by 
sacroiliac joint dysfunction can mimic discogenic or radicular low back pain, we 
assumed that the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is frequently 
overlooked.
PURPOSE: To assess the incidence of sacroiliac joint dysfunction in patients 
with low back pain and positive disc findings on CT scan or MRI, but without 
claudication or objective neurological deficits.
METHODS: Fifty patients with low back pain and disc herniation, without 
claudication or neurological abnormalities such as decreased motor strength, 
sensory alterations or sphincter incontinence and with positive pain provocation 
tests for sacroiliac joint dysfunction were submitted to fluoroscopic diagnostic 
sacroiliac joint infiltration.
RESULTS: The mean baseline VAS pain score was 7.8 +/- 1.77 (range 5-10). Thirty 
minutes after infiltration, the mean VAS score was 1.3 +/- 1.76 (median 
0.000E+00 with an average deviation from median = 1.30) (P = 0.0002). Forty-six 
patients had a VAS score ranging from 0 to 3, 8 weeks after the fluoroscopic 
guided infiltration. There were no serious complications after treatment. An 
unanticipated motor block that required hospitalization was seen in four 
patients, lasting from 12 to 36 h.
CONCLUSIONS: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction should be considered strongly in the 
differential diagnosis of low back pain in this group of patients.

(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 
USA.

Musculoskeletal functional outcome was assessed in children and adults with 
sacral agenesis and no myelomeningocele. General health, musculoskeletal 
function, and psychosocial adjustment were assessed in 16 sacral agenesis 
patients (10 males, 6 females; mean age, 14 +/- 5 years) using previously 
validated patient and parent self-report questionnaires. Radiographs were 
reviewed to classify each patient by Renshaw type. Most patients were happy with 
their looks, and all felt that their general health was good to excellent. 
Patients reported being limited in function by their low back and distal lower 
extremities. Half were limited by pain. They reported problems functioning in 
physically demanding situations, although most were able to participate in 
low-demand physical activities. No relationship was found between pain and 
Renshaw type nor between overall satisfaction and Renshaw type.

Lumbar intradural extramedullary bronchiogenic cyst.

Chongyi S(1), Meng Y, Dejun Y, Yingjie L, Qingpeng L.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedics, 2nd Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 
Harbin, China.

The pathological findings of an intradural and extramedullary cyst at the L1 
level of the spinal canal are described in a 28-year-old male who presented with 
chronic lumbago and progressive weakness and numbness in both lower limbs. 
Histopathological examination revealed the diagnosis of bronchiogenic cyst. 
Bronchiogenic cysts in the spinal canal are uncommon, and cysts at the L1 level 
are extremely rare. Their pathogenesis is still poorly understood. They are 
thought to be a malformation arising from a split notochordal syndrome. We 
conclude that intradural extramedullary bronchiogenic cysts may appear also at 
lumbar levels. Surgical resection can be achieved with good outcome.

Score distribution of the Scoliosis Quality of Life Index questionnaire in 
different subgroups of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

Parent EC(1), Hill D, Moreau M, Mahood J, Raso J, Lou E.

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, 
Canada. eparent@ualberta.net

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional measurement study.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the score distribution on the Scoliosis Quality of Life 
Index (SQLI) questionnaire domains and items for subjects with adolescent 
idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The SQLI was derived from the SRS-22 questionnaire 
so that it would be more applicable to persons with AIS between 10 and 18 years 
old. However, the score distribution of the SRS-22 is characterized by high 
ceiling effects within subgroups of persons with AIS.
METHODS: The SQLI questionnaire was completed by 95 females with AIS. Floor, 
ceiling effects, and score distribution were examined for subgroups based on age 
(n = 4), management (4), curve severity (3), and curve type (6).
RESULTS: Ceiling effect proportions (0%-40%) were higher than floor effects (n = 
1). Back pain and satisfaction were the only domains with ceiling effects 
exceeding 20%. For some domains, ceiling effects were significantly most 
prevalent for younger subgroups, those with low or moderate curve severity and 
those treated less aggressively. High ceiling effects were also observed for the 
observation, postsurgical, main thoracic, and double major curves subgroups. 
More than half the participants scored over 4/5 for all SQLI domains in the 
overall sample and in the observation, surgery, <13.5 years, 13.5 to <15 years, 
<30 degrees, 30 degrees to 50 degrees, main thoracic curves, double major 
curves, and thoracolumbar/lumbar curves subgroups, respectively. At least one 
item from each domain (except satisfaction) showed ceiling effects >50% in most 
subgroups (14 or more subgroups out of 15).
CONCLUSION: Even though ceiling effects (>20%) were not common, scores clustered 
near the top of the SQLI scale. The SQLI score distribution may impair the 
questionnaire's sensitivity to change and discriminative ability, particularly 
in younger subjects with lesser low or moderate curve severity, under 
observation or after surgery. The clinical utility of some SQLI items within 
each domain may be limited by high ceiling effects.

The past two decades have witnessed a sharp rise in the incidence of 
work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) off the upper extremities and low 
back pain. The high frequency of these Pathologies and the estimated costs 
induced a large number of searcher to indentify causes etiological and 
preventive measure. Epidemiological surveys have inquired people mainly devoted 
to health clinic, where nurses and health assistants partner; are few data on 
the rescuers drivers and operators of emergencies. In the sample considered the 
3.9% presented abnormalities in at least one section of the column, the 3.8% 
presented borne disorders of the cervical spine and backbone for the past 12 
months. No major disturbances emerged dependents of the upper limbs, pain in the 
wrist, paraesthesia day and night; No subject also reported disturbances hands 
as evidenced from examination goal. The 2.3% reported having had an accident at 
work with prognosis of less than 30 days and 06% over 30 days. The results 
showed that, through prevention program it is possible to reduce musculoskeletal 
disorders in specific occupations such as drivers and operators of emergencies.

Tokushima Graduate School, 3-18-15 Kuramoto, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Compared with the cervical spine, little attention has been 
paid to rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related lumbar disorders. Only a few articles 
have described the status of the lumbar spine affected by RA based on plain 
X-ray films and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
PURPOSE: To describe the features and prevalence of radiological changes of the 
lumbar spine of patients with RA and to clarify the correlations of such 
features with disease activity.
STUDY DESIGN: Transverse radiological study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: We radiographically examined 104 patients with RA whose age 
ranged from 21 to 78 years (mean, 51.0). In each, the duration of RA exceeded 10 
years (mean, 17.7 years).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included Ochi's classification, Lansbury 
index, C-reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dL), rheumatoid factor (RF) (U/mL), and 
platelet (count/mm). Radiological outcomes included radiography and MRI.
METHODS: One hundred four RA patients were included in this study regardless of 
the presence/absence of low back pain. We examined discs from L1-2 to L5-S, 
including endplates, in each patient on plain X-ray films and magnetic resonance 
images and used a comprehensive grading system to evaluate each feature of the 
lumbar spine affected by RA based on the present findings and published reports. 
The correlations of these radiological features with RA activity and Ochi's 
classification were examined. To quantify disease activity, we determined the 
Lansbury index, serum CRP (mg/dL), RF (U/mL), and platelet count (count/mm) at 
the time of radiological examinations.
RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 47 (45.2%) exhibited a lumbar lesion. There were 
two types of lumbar disc lesions related to RA: disc narrowing and disc 
ballooning. The Lansbury index of patients with the most severe lesions was 
significantly higher than that of patients with less severe lesions (p<.01). The 
frequency of lumbar involvement also increased as the number of affected 
peripheral joints increased, and Ochi's classification appeared to be useful in 
predicting the occurrence of lumbar lesions.
CONCLUSION: Of 104 patients, 47 (45.2%) exhibited abnormalities on X-ray films 
and MRI. There were two types of disorders, disc narrowing and disc ballooning.

The aging spine: the role of inflammatory mediators in intervertebral disc 
degeneration.

Human intervertebral disc undergoes multifactorial biochemical and morphologic 
degenerative changes during the process of aging. The frequency of degeneration, 
especially lumbar degeneration increases sharply with age and is regarded as a 
major cause of discogenic low back pain. Since degenerative discs are often 
asymptomatic, the pathobiology of discogenic back pain remains unclear. 
Degenerated discs spontaneously produce increased amounts of inflammatory 
mediators suggesting their role in the degenerative process of the 
intervertebral disc. However, the relationship between aging, degenerative 
processes, and actual illness is far from clear. Basic science research has 
demonstrated that the intervertebral disc is an avascular tissue element 
occupied by inadequately characterized cells in an extensive extracellular 
matrix. While the annulus fibrosus is predominantly collagenous, the matrix of 
the central nucleus pulposus is rich in proteoglycans. With aging, the substance 
of proteoglycans significantly decreases which is believed to be a critical 
factor in intervertebral disc degeneration. A variety of inflammatory mediators 
have been implicated in the degeneration of the intervertebral disc including 
nitric oxide (NO), interleukins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), prostaglandin 
E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and a group of cytokines. 
MMPs, PGE2, and a variety of cytokines have been already been shown to play a 
role in the degradation of articular cartilage. Nitric oxide is a novel mediator 
that is drawn into much attention recently for its role in disc abnormalities. 
Elevated nitric oxide production derived from NO synthase activity has been 
manifested in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with degenerative lumbar disease. 
However, the regulatory mechanism of NO and its relationship to the clinical 
manifestations are unclear. The biochemical events that occur with the 'aging 
spine' and in particular, the role of inflammatory mediators in intervertebral 
disc degeneration have not been studied assertively. Correspondingly, the 
association between degeneration of the intervertebral disc and the nociceptive 
mechanism of back pain is also not fully elucidated. However, there is high 
incidence of degenerated disc disorders manifested as back and neck pain and are 
among the most commonly encountered complaints in elderly population. It is 
hypothesized that the degenerative cascade ultimately leads to extensive 
structural defects and loss of normal motion segment function and configuration.

Boulevard, Cleveland, OH 44106-1702, USA. manzoor.ahmed@med.va.gov

Spine imaging accounts for a major share of expenses related to neck and back 
pain. Improving image quality translates into better morphologic evaluation of 
the spine. Unfortunately, the morphologic abnormalities on spine imaging are 
common and nonspecific, obscuring the relevance to patient symptomatology. 
Furthermore, distinction between degenerative and age-related changes is not 
clear. The key is clinical correlation of imaging findings. This article 
presents a concise and illustrated discussion of spinal neuroimaging related to 
neck and back pain, with emphasis on degenerative disease.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series with a control group.
OBJECTIVE: To measure the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and MR myelography (MRM) for symptomatic foraminal stenosis in patients 
who need surgery.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: MR images are extensively used in the evaluation of 
foraminal stenosis and are often used to evaluate nerves exiting from the 
foramen. There has been no published report of the diagnostic performance of 
these imaging methods (MRI and MRM).
METHODS: Diagnostic performances were studied in 90 patients in whom the site of 
the stenosis was confirmed by means of selective decompression surgeries. The 
disease prevalence among patients was 26% (23 of 90 patients). The disease 
prevalence among foramens was 3% (25 of 936 foramens). The prevalence of 
abnormal findings in 27 asymptomatic volunteers was also studied. Two blinded 
observers interpreted foraminal narrowing on combinations of sagittal and axial 
MR images, abnormalities of the course of the nerve root in the foramen, and 
spinal nerve swelling on MRM.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and 
negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI for the diagnosis of symptomatic 
foraminal stenosis were 96%, 67%, 4%, and 100%, respectively. The corresponding 
values for abnormal nerve root course on MRM were 96%, 83%, 7%, and 100%, 
respectively, and for spinal nerve swelling on MRM were 60%, 99%, 35%, and 99%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional MRI, MRM affords more specific 
information for the presurgical diagnosis of symptomatic foraminal stenosis.

roguns@comui.edu.ng

To evaluate our initial experience with Helical Computed Tomography (CT) 
Myelogram in the investigation of spinal abnormalities. As late as 1980, CT was 
still regarded as unreliable compared with myelography however, the advent of 
slip-ring technology in the 1990s, in association with the use of more powerful 
computers and higher energy x-ray tubes allowed a process known as Helical CT. 
This revolutionized CT scanning allowing achievement of thinner slices in a 
single breath-hold. Helical CT myelogram is one of the recent applications with 
the potential of improving clinical diagnosis in patients with spinal disorders. 
This is a descriptive study of 56 patients who had a CT myelogram in the first 
15 months of operation of a helical CT scanner at Ibadan (January 2004-March 
2005). Axial scans were done after a lumbar puncture with injection of 8-10 mls 
of contrast (iopamidol). Demographic, clinical data and CT findings were 
analyzed. Patient ages ranged from 3 to 75 years. The highest age frequency was 
seen in the 4th and 5th decade. 37 (66%) of these patients were males and 19 
(34%) were females. The majority of scans, 22 (39.2%) were in the thoracic and 
thoraco-lumbar regions. Low back pain was the most common indication 26 (32.1%) 
followed by paraplegia 24 (29.6%). Spinal cord compression and spondylosis 
represented 34% and 20% of the CT findings respectively. Helical CT myelogram is 
a valuable investigative tool which demonstrates spinal abnormalities well by 
providing a good silhouette image of the spinal cord.

Tethered cord due to spina bifida occulta presenting in adulthood: a tricenter 
review of 61 patients.

Wisconsin, USA.

OBJECT: Children with spina bifida occulta require early surgery to prevent 
neurological deficits. The treatment of patients with a congenitally tethered 
cord who present in adulthood remains controversial.
METHODS: The authors studied the medical records of 61 adult patients who 
underwent surgical untethering for spina bifida occulta at three institutions 
between 1994 and 2003. Patients who had undergone prior myelomeningocele repair 
or tethered cord release surgery were excluded. The most common intraoperative 
findings were lipomyelomeningocele (41%) and a tight terminal filum (36%). The 
follow-up duration ranged from 10.8 to 149.5 months. Of the 34 patients with 
back pain, status improved in 65%, worsened in 3%, remained unchanged in 18%, 
and improved and later recurred in 15%. Lower-extremity pain improved in 16 
patients (53%), remained unchanged in 23%, improved and then recurred in 17%, 
and worsened in 7%. Lower-extremity weakness improved in 47%, remained unchanged 
in 47%, and improved and then recurred in 5%. Finally, of the 17 patients with 
lower-extremity sensory changes, status improved in 35%, remained unchanged in 
35%, and the information on five patients was unavailable. Surgical 
complications included three wound infections, one cerebrospinal fluid leak, and 
two pseudomeningoceles requiring surgical revision. One patient developed acute 
respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis postoperatively and died several days 
later.
CONCLUSIONS: Adult-age presentation of a congenital tethered cord is unusual. 
Despite a slight increase in postoperative neurological injury in adults, 
surgery has relatively low risk and offers good potential for neurological 
improvement or stabilization. As they do in children, the authors recommend 
early surgery in adults with this disorder. The decision to undertake surgery, 
however, should be modulated by other factors such as a patient's general 
medical condition and risk posed by anesthesia.

BACKGROUND: The symptom triad of autosomal dominant Currarino syndrome (CS; MIM 
#176450) consists of anorectal malformation, a sacral bone defect, and presacral 
masses. Mutations in the homeoboxHLXB9 gene have already been described in a 
subset of sacrococcygeal anomalies characterized by partial sacral agenesis.
CASE: We report a 28-year-old male patient with Currarino syndrome due to a 
heterozygous novel frame-shift mutation c.336dupG (p.P113fsX224) in the 
homeoboxHLXB9 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular diagnostics may be helpful in cases of Hirschsprung's 
disease accompanied by other symptoms suggestive for Currarino syndrome, since 
it can lead to major complications such as perianal sepsis, meningitis, and 
malignant transformation.

Overview of the relationship between pain and obesity: What do we know? Where do 
we go next?

Overweight/obesity and pain are significant problems of increasing prevalence; 
understanding the relationship between the two is the focus of a growing body of 
research. Findings from this review support a likely relationship between 
increasing weight and pain conditions such as osteoarthritis and low back pain. 
Longitudinal studies suggest overweight/obesity early in life is a risk factor 
for pain, and the co-occurrence of pain and overweight/obesity negatively 
affects quality of life. The mechanism of relationship is unknown but is 
hypothesized to include mechanical and metabolic abnormalities, possibly 
secondary to lifestyle choices. Observations from a few studies demonstrate that 
treatments for obesity reduce pain secondary to weight loss. Few studies examine 
both pain and weight as primary outcomes, and variability in measurement makes 
comparisons and conclusions difficult. Research should focus on expanding 
knowledge about mechanisms of the relationship between pain and obesity, testing 
explanatory models addressing their co-occurrence, and developing treatments 
that most effectively target this comorbidity.

scohen40@jhmi.edu

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical factors associated with the success and 
failure of radiofrequency denervation of the lumbar facet joints.
METHODS: Clinical data were garnered from 3 academic medical centers on 192 
patients with low back pain who underwent radiofrequency denervation after a 
positive response to diagnostic blocks. Success was defined as >/=50% pain 
relief lasting at least 6 months. Factors evaluated for their association with 
outcome included duration of pain, opioid use, symptom location, paraspinal 
tenderness, pain exacerbated by extension/rotation (ie, facet loading), MRI 
abnormalities, diabetes, smoking, scoliosis, obesity, prior surgery and levels 
treated.
RESULTS: The only factor associated with a successful outcome was paraspinal 
tenderness. Variables that correlated with treatment failure were 'facet 
loading,' long duration of pain, and previous back surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: It is counterproductive to use 'facet loading' as the sole basis 
for choosing patients for facet interventions. In patients at high risk for 
treatment failure, taking additional steps to reduce the rate of false-positive 
screening blocks may improve outcomes.

Expert commentary: the safety of fibrates in lipid-lowering therapy.

Brown WV(1).

Author information:
(1)Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. 
w.virgil.brown@med.va.gov

The use of fibrates in the management of lipoprotein disorders has a history 
dating back to the mid-1960s. This group of drugs has now been tested in several 
large long-term trials with cardiovascular end points. Overall, there is good 
evidence for the reduction of cardiovascular disease in primary prevention 
studies and in those of subjects with manifest disease. More recent trials have 
suffered from high interference due to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A 
reductase inhibitor (statin) introduction, particularly in their placebo control 
groups. However, there is very good evidence for overall safety from a combined 
study of >20,000 patients in these controlled clinical trials lasting 
approximately 5 years. Abdominal pain has been observed more frequently in the 
statin vs placebo group. Myopathy, liver enzyme elevations, and cholecystitis 
have been potential adverse reactions of interest. However, these have occurred 
at a very low rate and are rarely found to be statistically more frequent in the 
active-treatment group compared with the subjects taking placebo. The recent 
Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study found a 
slightly higher incidence of pancreatitis, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary 
embolism. Small creatinine and homocysteine elevations are observed in many 
patients taking fibrates, and the effect of this on long-term outcomes is under 
study. The FIELD study also described a significant reduction in the rates of 
progression of proteinuria and vascular retinopathy with fibrate therapy. To 
date, there has been no study exclusive to patients with elevated triglycerides, 
raising the question of the potential benefit of these drugs in patients with 
the lipid abnormalities most effectively treated with fibrates.

The effect of lumbar flexion and extension on disc contour abnormality measured 
quantitatively on magnetic resonance imaging.

Parent EC(1), Videman T, Battié MC.

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, 
Canada.

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study with subjects as their own control.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if lumbar disc contour abnormality dimensions, measured 
quantitatively, differ in flexed, neutral or extended positions.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: MRIs obtained lying supine are used to determine the 
degree of lumbar disc contour abnormality (bulging or herniation). Variations in 
positioning are suspected to influence this assessment.
METHODS: Lumbar MR images for 26 male volunteers (24-74 years of age), with or 
without low back pain, were obtained with the subjects lying in neutral, maximal 
flexion, and maximal extension positions allowable within a conventional 1.5T MR 
scanner. Quantitative measures of anterior and posterior disc contour 
abnormality were obtained for each position.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in disc angles were obtained 
between positions (2-5 degrees) for all levels. Posterior contour abnormality 
was significantly smaller in flexion and extension than in the neutral position 
(9.5%-30.1%). Posterior contour abnormality in extension was similar or smaller 
than in flexion. Anterior contour abnormality was significantly smaller in 
extension than flexion and smaller in the neutral position than flexion.
CONCLUSION: Spine position should be standardized when assessing disc contour 
abnormality with MRI. The largest measured disc contour abnormalities when lying 
supine in a standard MR scanner are observed in the neutral position, as opposed 
to flexion or extension.

Spinal muscle evaluation in healthy individuals and low-back-pain patients: a 
literature review.

This article reviews available techniques for spinal muscle investigation, as 
well as data on spinal muscles in healthy individuals and in patients with low 
back pain. In patients with chronic low back pain, medical imaging studies show 
paraspinal muscle wasting with reductions in cross-sectional surface area and 
fiber density. In healthy individuals, the paraspinal muscles contain a high 
proportion of slow-twitch fibers (Type I), reflecting their role in maintaining 
posture. The proportion of Type I fibers is higher in females, leading to better 
adaptation to aerobic exertion compared to males. Abnormalities seen in 
paraspinal muscles from patients with chronic low back pain include marked Type 
II fiber atrophy, conversion of Type I to Type II fibers, and an increased 
number of nonspecific abnormalities. Limited data are available from magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy used to investigate muscle metabolism and from near 
infrared spectroscopy used to measure oxygen uptake by the paraspinal muscles. 
Surface electromyography in patients with chronic low back pain shows increased 
paraspinal muscle fatigability, often with abolition of the flexion-relaxation 
phenomenon.

An overview of radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging 
in the diagnosis of lumbar spine pathology.

Tilson ER(1), Strickland GD, Gibson SD.

Author information:
(1)Radiologic Sciences, Armstrong Atlantic State University, Savannah, GA, USA.

When patients present with symptoms associated with lumbar spine pathology, 
often a series of diagnostic examinations of escalating sophistication are 
utilized. To obtain a diagnosis, the initial study is usually done on lumbar 
spine radiographs, which demonstrate gross bony pathologies, spinal alignment, 
and bone density. Frequently, additional high-cost invasive or noninvasive 
procedures may be required. Myelography is used to examine the spinal cord, 
nerve root bundles, and possible intrusion of the vertebral disk into the spinal 
canal. Computed tomography is most useful for imaging small bony structures and, 
when coupled with myelography, can demonstrate soft tissue abnormalities in the 
spinal canal. Magnetic resonance imaging is, however, the preferred modality for 
imaging soft tissue.

Correlation between centralization or peripheralization of symptoms in low back 
pain and the results of magnetic resonance imaging.

Author information:
(1)Klinika Ortopedii CMKP, Otwock.

Background. One of the main reasons for low back pain is displacement of the 
nucleus pulposus within the intervertebral disc and spinal canal. In the 
diagnosis of low back pain a clinical examination is essential, supplemented by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The main purpose of our research was to 
demonstrate that the results of a functional diagnosis based on the McKenzie 
protocol, when compared to abnormalities found in MRI, allow for more efficient 
management of conservative therapy. Material and methods. Our clinical material 
consisted of 98 patients, divided into 2 groups according to whether the 
symptoms observed were centralized (group A) or peripheralized (group B). The 
results of the clinical examination was compared with MRI examinations. Results. 
In order to assess treatment effectiveness and prognosis in low back pain with 
MRI findings, a precise analysis was done. Three groups were distinguished: 49 
patients had herniation and extrusion of the nucleus pulpous, but the annulus 
fibrosus and the fluid reserve were intact; 46 patients had extrusions or 
sequestrations, along with stenosis of the spinal canal; 3 patients had no 
pressure on the nerve roots. Conclusion. Centralization usually implied that the 
annulus fibrosus would be intact in MRI examination. In these cases the MRI 
revealed herniations. Centralization also occurred in cases of extrusions where 
the spinal canal was wide, and the liquid reserve was preserved. 
Peripheralization occurred in cases of sequestration and extrusions when there 
was stenosis of the spinal canal.liquid reserve was preserved. 2. 
Peripheralisation occurred in the cases of sequestration and extrusions when 
spinal canal was narrow.

STUDY DESIGN: A radiographic study of 82 patients with L5-S1 spondylolysis or 
spondylolisthesis of less than 50% displacement of L5 on S1.
OBJECTIVE: To measure and describe the sagittal alignment of the spine and 
pelvis in patients with spondylolysis before the development of a large 
secondary deformity associated with progression of the spondylolisthesis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several publications have addressed the alignment of 
the spine and pelvis as an important factor in the occurrence, symptomatology, 
progression, and treatment of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report to systematically document the native 
sagittal alignment of affected patients and compare them to a large control 
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sagittal alignment in this cohort of 82 patients was 
compared with a control population of 160 patients without symptoms of back pain 
or radiographic abnormalities of the spine and pelvis that was the subject of a 
previous study.
RESULTS: Patients with spondylolysis and low-grade spondylolisthesis demonstrate 
increased pelvic incidence, increased lumbar lordosis, but less segmental 
extension between L5 and S1 than in a normal population.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that differences in the sagittal alignment of 
the spine and pelvis may influence the biomechanical environment that results in 
the development of spondylolysis and progressive spondylolisthesis.

Technology Insight: imaging of low back pain.

pfinch@linet.net.au

Chronic low back pain is a common condition that has significant economic 
consequences for affected patients and their communities. Despite the prevailing 
view that an anatomic diagnosis is often impossible, an origin for the pain can 
frequently be found if current diagnostic techniques are fully used. Such 
techniques include a mixture of noninvasive and invasive imaging. Prevalence 
data suggest that the intervertebral disc is one of the most common sources of 
back pain, accounting for around 40% of cases. The pathologic basis for 
discogenic low back pain might be full-thickness radial tears of the annulus 
fibrosus. Unfortunately, only MRI can image the internal morphology of the disc, 
and both CT and MRI lack the necessary specificity to validate this hypothesis. 
Many so-called radiographic abnormalities seen on CT and MRI are commonly 
encountered in asymptomatic individuals. Invasive techniques such as joint 
injections, nerve blocks and provocative discography can show the connection 
between an abnormal image and the source of low back pain, but do have notable 
related risks. The development of a noninvasive, low-risk technique that can 
show this connection is desirable.

The theory of chemical radiculitis had been put forward about 30 years ago, but 
as yet it has not been proved by clinical studies. The aim of the current 
studies was to determine whether the annular tear of a painful disc proved by 
discography is the cause of radiating leg pain (radiculopathy) in patients with 
discogenic low back pain. Forty-two patients with discogenic low back pain at 
single disc level with concomitant radiating leg pain were studied in order to 
analyse the relationship between site of annular tear and side of radiating leg 
pain. Electromyogram and motor nerve conduction velocity were monitored to 
examine nerve root injury. The current studies found that there was a 
significant positive correlation between the site of annular tear and the side 
of radiation pain. Abnormalities of electromyogram and reduction of motor nerve 
conduction velocity were found on the side of radiating leg pain. The studies 
indicated that leakage of chemical mediators or inflammatory cytokines, which 
are produced in the painful disc, into epidural space through annular tear could 
lead to injury to adjacent nerve roots, and it might constitute the primary 
pathophysiologic mechanism of radiating leg pain in patients with discogenic low 
back pain but with no disc herniation.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive value of MRI vertebral end-plate changes 
(Modic) on clinical outcome of surgically treated lumbar single-level 
degenerative disc disease (DDD).
METHODS: A cohort of 60 patients was included. Patient groups were similar in 
respect of age, gender and clinical presentation, allowing comparisons. Patient 
age ranged from 30 to 72 years (mean: 45.8 years). All patients suffered severe 
chronic low back pain for more than 6 months, with single-level symptomatic DDD. 
All patients experienced segmental instrumented interbody (n = 22) or 
posterolateral (n = 38) fusion. Clinical outcome was assessed by using a visual 
analog scale (VAS) and the functional disability scale of the Japanese 
Orthopaedic Association (JOA) for lumbar spine. The number of patients for each 
Modic group was as follows: Modic type 0, n = 15; Modic type I, n = 22; Modic 
type II, n = 14; and Modic type I/II, n = 9. Fusion rates were similar for each 
Modic group of patients. Mean follow-up was 14 months.
RESULTS: The pre-operative mean VAS improved by 53.5% (from 8.2+/-2.0 to 
3.8+/-1.9, p < 0.05) and the pre-operative mean JOA score by 58% (from 5.5+/-2.1 
to 11.0+/-2.4, p < 0.05). Patients harboring Modic type I changes improved much 
better than others (p < 0.05). Conversely, clinical outcome of patients 
presenting with Modic type II lesions was poor.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms instrumented fusion as an effective treatment in 
symptomatic lumbar DDD. Preoperative combination of low back pain of discal 
origin and severe DDD with Modic type I lesion on MRI may lead to excellent 
results after fusion in a large proportion of patients. Conversely, arthrodesis 
for patients harboring Modic type II abnormalities implicates smaller benefit of 
doubtful clinical significance.

Are "structural abnormalities" on magnetic resonance imaging a contraindication 
to the successful conservative treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain?

Kleinstück F(1), Dvorak J, Mannion AF.

(1)Spine Unit, Schulthess Klinik, Zürich, Switzerland.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between structural abnormalities recorded 
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outcome after evidence-based 
conservative treatment in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In most guidelines for the management of LBP, MRI is 
not recommended unless the diagnostic triage suggests serious spinal pathology 
or nerve root involvement for which surgical treatment is foreseen. This is 
because many structural changes seen on MRI appear to be as common in 
asymptomatic individuals as in people with LBP and are, therefore, considered of 
little value in either explaining the cause of pain or deciding the subsequent 
course of management. However, to our knowledge, no studies have assessed 
whether the presence of such MRI abnormalities influences the outcome of the 
conservative treatment that patients with chronic nonspecific LBP typically 
receive.
METHODS: T2-weighted, 4-mm spin-echo MRI sequences of the lumbar spine were 
obtained from 53 patients with chronic nonspecific LBP before a 3-month program 
of exercise therapy. Disc degeneration, disc bulging, high intensity zones, and 
endplate/bone marrow changes were assessed for each lumbar segment. Back pain 
(average and worst) and disability (Roland Morris score) were assessed before 
and after therapy, and 12 months later, and the improvements were examined in 
relation to the presence or absence of baseline MRI "abnormalities."
RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of patients had severe disc degeneration (grade 4 
or 5), 74% had disc bulging, 60% had high intensity zones, and 62% had 
endplate/bone marrow changes in at least 1 lumbar segment. Only 11% patients had 
none of these changes at any level. The MRI abnormalities showed only minimal 
association with baseline symptoms. In multivariate regression analyses, in 
which age, gender, and baseline symptoms were controlled for, only 1 significant 
association between the MRI variables and outcome was observed: the presence of 
a high intensity zone in any vertebral segment was associated with lower average 
pain at the 12-month follow-up (standardized beta -0.376, P = 0.006, 16.5% 
variance accounted for).
CONCLUSION: In the patient group examined, the presence of common "structural 
abnormalities" on MRI had no significant negative influence on the outcome after 
therapy.

Lumbosacral nerve root anomaly associated with spondylolisthesis in an 
adolescent: a case report and review of the literature.

Davidson D(1), Rowan R, Reilly C.

Author information:

Vancouver, BC, Canada.

STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
OBJECTIVE: We describe the case of a lumbosacral nerve root anomaly in a 
16-year-old male with spondylolisthesis and neurologic findings exceeding that 
that was expected of the underlying deformity. A complete review of clinical, 
radiologic, and operative records was performed.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spondylolisthesis is a relatively common cause of 
lower back pain in adolescents. Neurologic findings may occur, most commonly 
associated with higher grade spondylolisthesis and spondyloptosis. Lumbosacral 
nerve root anomalies have been reported and are typically associated with 
neurologic symptoms in excess of the underlying deformity.
METHODS: The 16-year-old male presented with lower back pain, difficulty 
walking, and sensory and motor symptoms in the L5 and S1 nerve root 
distributions. Radiographs revealed a Meyerding grade III spondylolisthesis, 
with a slip angle of 14 degrees and a lumbosacral angle of 76 degrees . Neither 
computerized tomography nor magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of 
lumbosacral nerve root anomalies.
RESULTS: Intraoperatively, an L5-S1 anastomotic nerve root on the left side was 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need to consider the presence of 
lumbosacral nerve root anomalies in cases in which neurologic findings exceed 
what would be anticipated. Preoperative identification of these anomalies allows 
for their existence to be considered in the surgical plan.

Bertolotti's syndrome. A cause of back pain in young people.

Quinlan JF(1), Duke D, Eustace S.

Ireland. jfquinlan@hotmail.com

Bertolotti's syndrome is characterised by anomalous enlargement of the 
transverse process(es) of the most caudal lumbar vertebra which may articulate 
or fuse with the sacrum or ilium and cause isolated L4/5 disc disease. We 
analysed the elective MR scans of the lumbosacral spine of 769 consecutive 
patients with low back pain taken between July 2003 and November 2004. Of these 
568 showed disc degeneration. Bertolotti's syndrome was present in 35 patients 
with a mean age of 32.7 years (15 to 60). This was a younger age than that of 
patients with multiple disc degeneration, single-level disease and isolated disc 
degeneration at the L4/5 level (p </= 0.05). The overall incidence of 
Bertolotti's syndrome in our study was 4.6% (35 of 769). It was present in 11.4% 
(20 patients) of the under-30 age group. Our findings suggest that Bertolotti's 
syndrome must form part of a list of differential diagnoses in the investigation 
of low back pain in young people.

An adult patient experienced attacks of severe low back pain and sciatic 
neuralgia for several years, sometimes associated with myalgias, skin lesions, 
and high fever. Specific inflammatory laboratory tests were the major 
abnormalities. P46L mutation in the gene on chromosome 12p13 that encodes tumor 
necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1A (TNFRSF1A) was found. Management with 
anti-TNF agent was effective with a complete remission of bouts of pain and 
fever.

Pathophysiological model for chronic low back pain integrating connective tissue 
and nervous system mechanisms.

05405, United States. Helene.langevin@uvm.edu

Although chronic low back pain (cLBP) is increasingly recognized as a complex 
syndrome with multifactorial etiology, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the 
development of chronic pain in this condition remain poorly understood. This 
article presents a new, testable pathophysiological model integrating connective 
tissue plasticity mechanisms with several well-developed areas of research on 
cLBP (pain psychology, postural control, neuroplasticity). We hypothesize that 
pain-related fear leads to a cycle of decreased movement, connective tissue 
remodeling, inflammation, nervous system sensitization and further decreased 
mobility. In addition to providing a new, testable framework for future 
mechanistic studies of cLBP, the integration of connective tissue and nervous 
system plasticity into the model will potentially illuminate the mechanisms of a 
variety of treatments that may reverse these abnormalities by applying 
mechanical forces to soft tissues (e.g. physical therapy, massage, chiropractic 
manipulation, acupuncture), by changing specific movement patterns (e.g. 
movement therapies, yoga) or more generally by increasing activity levels (e.g. 
recreational exercise). Non-invasive measures of connective tissue remodeling 
may eventually become important tools to evaluate and follow patients with cLBP 
in research and clinical practice. An integrative mechanistic model 
incorporating behavioral and structural aspects of cLBP will strengthen the 
rationale for a multidisciplinary treatment approach including direct mechanical 
tissue stimulation, movement reeducation, psychosocial intervention and 
pharmacological treatment to address this common and debilitating condition.

resonance imaging, and occupational variables.

Although the effect of physical workload on the occurrence of low back pain 
(LBP) has been extensively investigated, few quantitative studies have examined 
the morphological changes visualized via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 
relation to occupational variables. The relationship between the severity of 
some abnormalities such as lumbar spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis and 
physical or psychosocial occupational risk factors has not been investigated 
previously. In this cross-sectional study patients fulfilled the following 
inclusion criteria: (1) long-standing (minimum 1-year) LBP radiating down the 
leg (or not); (2) age more than 40 years; (3) willingness to undergo an MRI of 
the lumbar spine; and (4) ability to speak Italian. Primary objective of the 
study was to investigate the association between occupational exposure and 
morphological MRI findings, while controlling for the individual risk factors 
for LBP. Secondarily, we looked at the influence of this exposure and the 
degenerative changes in the lumbar spine on clinical symptoms and the related 
disability. Lumbar MRI scans from 120 symptomatic patients were supplemented by 
the results of structured interviews, which provided personal, medical, and 
occupational histories. All occupational factors were arranged on scales of 
increasing exposure, whereas pain and disability were assessed using ad hoc 
validated questionnaires. Evidence of intervertebral disc narrowing or 
herniation and the occurrence and severity of spinal stenosis and 
spondylolisthesis was obtained from the MRI scans and a summative degenerative 
score was then calculated. We detected a direct association between increasing 
age and the global amount of degenerative change, the severity of intervertebral 
disc height loss, the number of narrowed discs, stenosis, the number of stenotic 
levels, and spondylolisthesis. Physical occupational exposure was not associated 
with the presence of lumbar disc degeneration and narrowing per se, but a higher 
degree of such an exposure was directly associated with a higher degree of 
degeneration (P=0.017). Spondylolistesis and stenosis were positively related to 
heavy workload (P=0.014) and the manual handling of materials (P=0.023), 
respectively. Psychosocial occupational discomfort was directly associated to 
stenosis (P=0.041) and number of stenotic levels (P=0.019). A heavier job 
workload was the only occupational factor positively related to the degree of 
disability at the multivariate analysis (P=0.002). Total amount of degeneration 
in the lumbar spine directly influenced pain duration (P=0.011) and degree of 
disability (P=0.050). These results suggest that caution should be exercised 
when symptomatic subjects with evidence of degenerative changes on MRI scans 
engage in strenuous physical labor.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the INTERMED questionnaire score, 
alone or combined with other criteria, in predicting return to work after a 
multidisciplinary rehabilitation program in patients with non-specific chronic 
low back pain.
METHODS: The INTERMED questionnaire is a biopsychosocial assessment and clinical 
classification tool that separates heterogeneous populations into subgroups 
according to case complexity. We studied 88 patients with chronic low back pain 
who followed an intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation program on an 
outpatient basis. Before the program, we recorded the INTERMED score, 
radiological abnormalities, subjective pain severity, and sick leave duration. 
Associations between these variables and return to full-time work within 3 
months after the end of the program were evaluated using one-sided Fisher tests 
and univariate logistic regression followed by multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: The univariate analysis showed a significant association between the 
INTERMED score and return to work (P<0.001; odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.86-0.96). In the multivariate analysis, prediction was best when the 
INTERMED score and sick leave duration were used in combination (P=0.03; odds 
ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.93).
CONCLUSION: The INTERMED questionnaire is useful for evaluating patients with 
chronic low back pain. It could be used to improve the selection of patients for 
intensive multidisciplinary programs, thereby improving the quality of care, 
while reducing healthcare costs.

Magnetic resonance image-based morphological predictors of single photon 
emission computed tomography-positive facet arthropathy in patients with axial 
back pain.

Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA. keunyoun@usc.edu

OBJECTIVE: A major barrier to understanding facetogenic low back pain has been 
the lack of radiographic diagnostic criteria. This study investigates the 
correlation between radiographic findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scans and single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scans in patients 
clinically found to have facetogenic axial back pain.
METHODS: Thirty-one patients with severe axial back pain underwent lumbar MRI 
and SPECT scans. Two hundred thirty facets were identified and were graded from 
1 to 4 using synovial area, size, cartilaginous discontiguity, osteophytic 
overgrowth, and joint space obliteration. Twenty-nine "hot" joints were 
identified on SPECT scans. MRI features of 230 lumbar facets were correlated 
with SPECT results.
RESULTS: Four basic morphological patterns were identified on the basis of 
synovial appearance on MRI scans, light, mottled, narrowed, and obliterated, and 
formed the basis for the grading 1 to 4, respectively (sensitivity for "hot 
facet", 0.93). The mottled group had 0.90 specificity (P = 0.0001). Osteophytic 
overgrowth demonstrated 0.94 specificity (P = 0.0004). Facet hypertrophy was not 
associated with increased tracer uptake.
CONCLUSION: We identify four types of synovial architecture on T2-weighted MRI 
scans with overall high sensitivity for predicting SPECT positivity. These four 
grades likely represent a continuum of facet degeneration, from a normal to 
obliterated joint. One particular subtype, Grade 2, demonstrated a high 
specificity for SPECT and synovial fluid increase suggestive of inflammation. 
Facet hypertrophy was not predictive of bone scan positivity, perhaps suggesting 
the protective nature of a hypertrophied facet. Synovial abnormalities correlate 
with SPECT findings and a grading scale is proposed delineating the degeneration 
of a lumbar facet over time. A subtype of SPECT(+) inflamed joint is proposed. 
Further studies will be needed to improve our understanding of the natural 
history of the lumbar facet.

    AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2007 Feb;188(2):W210; author reply W211.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether identification 
of the iliolumbar ligaments is of practical use for numbering lumbosacral 
transitional vertebrae (LSTV).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred consecutive lumbar spine MRI studies were 
reviewed. A standard protocol of sagittal and axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted 
spin-echo sequences was used. The sagittal images were assessed for the presence 
of an LSTV, and axial images were assessed for the level of origin of the 
iliolumbar ligaments.
RESULTS: Of the 500 patients, 433 (86.6%) had normal lumbosacral segmentation 
and 67 (13.4%) had a transitional lumbosacral junction. The iliolumbar ligament 
was identified at L5 in all patients with normal lumbosacral segmentation (n = 
433), bilaterally in 432 and unilaterally in one. Using the identification of 
the iliolumbar ligaments as a marker of the L5 vertebral level, we numbered 46 
of the 67 LSTV as L5 transitions and 21 as S1 transitions.
CONCLUSION: The iliolumbar ligament is readily identifiable on axial lumbar 
spine MRI and always arises from L5. We suggest that its position can be used to 
confidently assign lumbar levels in patients with LSTV.

Metanephric adenoma is a rare benign tumor of the kidney. It is considered to be 
derived from embryonic renal tissue and to be the benign counterpart of the 
Wilms tumor. Although its imaging findings and immunohistochemistry are 
nonspecific, it has a typical microscopic morphology. We describe a case of a 
24-year-old primigravida who presented in the 28th week of pregnancy with lower 
back pain, fever, malaise, and anemia. At renal ultrasonography and magnetic 
resonance imaging, a hemorrhagic tumor of 10 cm in diameter originating from the 
right kidney was seen. Based on the imaging findings, the diagnosis of a cystic 
renal cell carcinoma with recent hemorrhage was suggested, and a radical 
nephrectomy was performed. Pathologic examination concluded to a metanephric 
adenoma. The further pregnancy went on well. The karyotype of the tumor was 
46,XX,t(1;22)(q22;q13),t(15;16)(q21;p13). To our knowledge, this is the first 
report on these chromosomal abnormalities in metanephric adenoma.

The association between psychopathology and placebo analgesia in patients with 
discogenic low back pain.

BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain patients have a high rate of psychopathology, 
comprised mainly of depression, anxiety, and high levels of neuroticism. We 
previously found that psychopathology is associated with increased placebo 
analgesia in this patient group.
OBJECTIVE: To better understand this finding in the context of other known 
predictors of placebo response (such as expectations for relief), we performed a 
detailed analysis of expectations and other possible covariates.
DESIGN: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 
crossover-designed trial of intravenous morphine vs. placebo in 60 subjects with 
chronic low back pain and discogenic abnormalities. Patients were stratified 
into three groups of psychiatric symptom severity (Low, Moderate, and High), 
based on composite scores on depression, anxiety for pain, and neuroticism 
scales. Subjects were given intravenous morphine and placebo in random order on 
separate visits, and completed serial pain ratings over 3 h at each session.
RESULTS: With 20 subjects per group, there were small, but significant 
differences between groups in baseline pain ratings. No differences were found 
between groups in age, gender, and radicular pain. Patients with low 
psychological symptomatology reported 7.7% total pain relief with placebo 
compared with 23.4% in the Moderate group and 23.5% in the High group (P < 
0.05). Expectations were not significantly different between groups, but in the 
High group expectation levels predicted placebo analgesia (P < 0.001). 
Neuropathic pain quality was also a predictor (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that high and moderate levels of 
psychopathology are associated with heightened placebo analgesia in chronic low 
back pain patients. Expectations were only an influence in the high 
psychopathology group, and neuropathic pain affects placebo responses. These 
findings have implications for future research characterizing placebo 
responders.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Performing nontraditional abdominal exercises with 
devices such as abdominal straps, the Power Wheel, and the Ab Revolutionizer has 
been suggested as a way to activate abdominal and extraneous (nonabdominal) 
musculature as effectively as more traditional abdominal exercises, such as the 
crunch and bent-knee sit-up. The purpose of this study was to test the 
effectiveness of traditional and nontraditional abdominal exercises in 
activating abdominal and extraneous musculature.
SUBJECTS: Twenty-one men and women who were healthy and between 23 and 43 years 
of age were recruited for this study.
METHODS: Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to assess muscle activity from 
the upper and lower rectus abdominis, external and internal oblique, rectus 
femoris, latissimus dorsi, and lumbar paraspinal muscles while each exercise was 
performed. The EMG data were normalized to maximum voluntary muscle 
contractions. Differences in muscle activity were assessed by a 1-way, 
repeated-measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Upper and lower rectus abdominis, internal oblique, and latissimus 
dorsi muscle EMG activity were highest for the Power Wheel (pike, knee-up, and 
roll-out), hanging knee-up with straps, and reverse crunch inclined 30 degrees. 
External oblique muscle EMG activity was highest for the Power Wheel (pike, 
knee-up, and roll-out) and hanging knee-up with straps. Rectus femoris muscle 
EMG activity was highest for the Power Wheel (pike and knee-up), reverse crunch 
inclined 30 degrees, and bent-knee sit-up. Lumbar paraspinal muscle EMG activity 
was low and similar among exercises.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The Power Wheel (pike, knee-up, and roll-out), 
hanging knee-up with straps, and reverse crunch inclined 30 degrees not only 
were the most effective exercises in activating abdominal musculature but also 
were the most effective in activating extraneous musculature. The relatively 
high rectus femoris muscle activity obtained with the Power Wheel (pike and 
knee-up), reverse crunch inclined 30 degrees, and bent-knee sit-up may be 
problematic for some people with low back problems.

Therapeutic efficacy of facet joint blocks.

Author information:

Balgrist, Zurich, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate outcome predictors of 
short- and medium-term therapeutic efficacy of facet joint blocks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with chronic lower back pain who were 
undergoing facet joint blocks at one (n = 29) or two (n = 13) levels were 
analyzed. All patients underwent MRI or CT of the lumbar spine within 5 months 
before the facet joint blocks. The facet joint blocks were performed under 
fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount (< 0.3 mL) of iodinated contrast agent, 
0.5 mL of local anesthetics and 0.5 mL of steroids, were injected. The initial 
pain response was prospectively assessed using a visual analogue scale. 
Additional data, including short-term effect (> 1 week) and medium-term effect 
(> 3 months), were collected by a structured telephone interview. CT and MRI 
were reviewed with regard to the extent of facet joint abnormalities. Multiple 
logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify outcome predictor for 
efficacy of facet joint blocks.
RESULTS: A positive immediate effect was seen in 31 patients (74%). A positive 
medium-term effect was found in 14 patients (33%). Pain alleviated by motion (p 
= 0.035) and the absence of joint-blocking sensation (p = 0.042) predicted pain 
relief. However, the extent of facet joint osteoarthritis on MRI and CT was not 
a significant predictor for outcome (p = 0.57-0.95).
CONCLUSION: Facet joint blocks appear to have a beneficial medium-term effect in 
one third of patients with chronic lower back pain and may therefore be a 
reasonable adjunct to nonoperative treatment. However, outcome appears to depend 
on clinical, not on morphologic, imaging findings.

STUDY DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and protein 
gene product (PGP) 9.5 in vertebral endplates of patients with discogenic low 
back pain and Modic Type 1 or Type 2 endplate changes on MRI.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether inflammatory cytokines and nerve in-growth into 
the vertebral endplate are associated with discogenic low back pain.
SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: Degenerated discs and endplate abnormalities can be 
a cause of discogenic low back pain. However, the presence of TNF-immunoreactive 
cells and PGP 9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibers has not been studied in patients 
with discogenic low back pain and endplate changes on MRI.
METHODS: Eighteen endplates showing either normal intensity signals on MRI 
(endplate change -), Modic Type 1 signals (low intensity on T1-weighted 
spin-echo images), or Modic Type 2 signals (high intensity) from patients with 
discogenic low back pain (n = 14) or controls requiring surgery for other back 
problems (n = 4; scoliosis and traumatic injury of vertebra) were harvested 
during surgery. Endplates were immunostained using antibodies to TNF and PGP 9.5 
and immunostained cells and nerve fibers in the endplates were counted.
RESULTS: Vertebral endplates from patients with Modic Type 1 or Type 2 endplate 
changes on MRI had significantly more PGP 9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibers and 
TNF-immunoreactive cells in comparison with patients with normal endplates on 
MRI (P < 0.01). The number of TNF-immunoreactive cells in endplates exhibiting 
Modic Type 1 changes was significantly higher than in endplates exhibiting Modic 
Type 2 changes (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that endplate abnormalities are related to 
inflammation and axon growth induced by TNF. TNF expression and PGP 9.5-positive 
nerve in-growth in abnormal endplates may be a cause of low back pain.

OBJECTIVES: We report a patient in whom paraplegia developed following 
transforaminal epidural injection of a corticosteroid and discuss the 
physiopathology of this complication, based on a literature survey.
CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old man presented with low-back pain and symptoms of L4 
radiculopathy due to degenerative disc herniation resistant to conventional 
medical treatment. Computed tomography revealed posterolateral L4-L5 disc 
protrusion. A dosage of 125 mg of hydrocortisone was given by epidural 
transforaminal L4-L5 left injection under radioscopy guidance. Within minutes 
following the injection, intense pain developed in both legs, with T12 complete 
paraplegia. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 2 hours later did not 
reveal spinal cord abnormalities. The patient underwent immediate surgery 
consisting of excising the protruding disc and extensive L3-L5 laminectomy. MRI 
performed 3 months later did not reveal medullar abnormalities. Six months 
later, the patient continued to show slow neurologic improvement, permitting him 
to walk with crutches and to stop intermittent self-catheterisation.
DISCUSSION: The occurrence of paraplegia following epidural transforaminal 
injection of corticosteroids is a rare complication. To our knowledge, only 5 
similar cases have been described. Most of the authors proposed that the 
mechanism of this complication is ischemia of the terminal cone due to 
accidental suppression of medullary blood supply. Direct lesion of a medullar 
artery, arterial spasm, or corticosteroid-induced occlusion due to undetected 
intra-arterial injection could lead to this medullar infarction. Anatomical 
variations of the path followed by the Adamkievicz artery strongly support this 
hypothesis.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown increased degenerative disk changes and 
spine injuries in the competitive female gymnast. However, it has also been 
shown that many of these findings are found in asymptomatic athletic people of 
the same age. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies evaluating the 
gymnastic spine have not made a distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic 
athletes. Our hypothesis is that MRI will demonstrate the same types of 
abnormalities in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic gymnasts.
DESIGN: Olympic-level female gymnasts received prospectively an MRI exam of the 
lumbar spine. Each of the gymnasts underwent a physical exam by a sports 
medicine physician just prior to the MRI for documentation of low back pain. 
Each MRI exam was evaluated for anterior apophyseal ring avulsion injury, 
compression deformity of the vertebral body, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, 
degenerative disease, focal disk protrusion/extrusion, muscle strain, epidural 
mass, and bone-marrow edema.
PATIENTS: Nineteen Olympic-level female gymnasts (age 12-20 years) were 
evaluated prospectively in this study. All of these gymnasts were evaluated 
while attending a specific training camp.
RESULTS: Anterior ring apophyseal injuries (9/19) and degenerative disk disease 
(12/19) were common. Spondylolysis (3/19) and spondylolisthesis (3/19) were 
found. Focal bone-marrow edema was found in both L3 pedicles in one gymnast. 
History and physical exam revealed four gymnasts with current low back pain at 
the time of imaging. There were findings confined to those athletes with current 
low back pain: spondylolisthesis, spondylolysis, bilateral pedicle bone-marrow 
edema, and muscle strain.
CONCLUSIONS: Our initial hypothesis was not confirmed, in that there were 
findings that were confined to the symptomatic group of elite-level female 
gymnasts.

nina.zaproudina@uku.fi

OBJECTIVE: To study the skin temperature disorders in low back pain (LBP) 
patients compared with reference persons without LBP and to evaluate the 
relationship between pain intensity and other clinical signs and temperature 
abnormalities.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients with unilateral chronic LBP with or without 
referred nonradicular leg pain (29 men and 36 women; age range, 30-51 years) and 
20 reference persons without LBP (7 men and 13 women; age range, 30-49 years) 
participated in this study. The pain level was recorded by the use of a visual 
analog scale (0-100). Questionnaires and a series of spinal mobility tests (the 
modified Schober, straight leg-raising test, finger-floor distance, side 
bending) were used. Thermographic images of the low back area and legs 
(anterior, lateral, and posterior surfaces and the plantar surfaces of feet) 
were taken with an infrared video camera.
RESULTS: The temperature changes in the plantar surface correlated with LBP 
intensity. The pain levels differed in the groups with the different types of 
temperature changes. There were significant lower extremity regional skin 
temperature alterations (at least 1 regional interside difference more than 0.3 
degrees C) in most cases both in LBP patients and in reference persons, but 
plantar interside temperature difference was significantly higher in LBP 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Temperature changes of the plantar surface seem to be connected with 
LBP intensity. Temperature measurements may be useful as an adjunctive 
physiological test in the evaluation and documentation of autonomic dysfunction 
in LBP patients.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) agenesis is a rare anomaly that is usually an 
incidental finding in radiologic work-up or it can rarely be symptomatic due to 
deep venous thrombosis of iliac veins. In this report, we present a case of IVC 
agenesis detected on lumbar spinal MR imaging scans by extensive 
epidural-paravertebral collateral vessels compressing the thecal sac and causing 
low back pain in a child.

and Technology University, Wuhan 430030, China.

Lumbar sacralization and lumbarization are congenital spine malformation. 16 
cases with lumbar sacralization or lumbarization were reviewed. Through studying 
the etiopathogenisis and clinical manifestation we analyze the relationship 
between injury and disease. 6 cases of 16 have lumbar sacralization. 10 cases 
are attributed to lumbarization. Most of this cases have backleg pain more or 
less. As a forensic doctor we suggest that pay more attention to this problem in 
our identify practice and locate the sequence of vertebral body more exactly.

Effects of pelvic skeletal asymmetry on trunk movement: three-dimensional 
analysis in healthy individuals versus patients with mechanical low back pain.

Scotia, Canada. ealeisa@dal.ca

STUDY DESIGN: Comparative analysis and correlational research design were used 
to investigate the association between anthropometry and biomechanical 
performance among asymptomatic subjects and patients with low back pain (LBP).
OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between pelvic asymmetry and patterns of 
trunk motion in asymptomatic and LBP subjects. Secondary objective was to 
investigate the association between restricted trunk motion, laterality of 
referred pain, and pelvic asymmetry.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Subtle pelvic asymmetry (exhibited as either lateral 
pelvic tilt or iliac rotational asymmetry), which is common among normal 
individuals, has not been convincingly linked to abnormalities in back 
movements. Given the difficulty in diagnosing most LBP, a classification using 
pelvic asymmetry and patterns of movement could be helpful in establishing a 
rational treatment plan.
METHODS: Fifty-nine subjects with no history of LBP and 54 patients with 
mechanical unilateral LBP were tested. An anthropometric frame was used to 
measure pelvic asymmetry in standing. Dynamic motion data, comprised of the 
principal and coupled movements, were collected using the Qualysis Motion 
Capture System.
RESULTS: While the groups did not differ in the total range of lumbar movement, 
the LBP group exhibited significantly higher asymmetry in the principal motion. 
The groups differed significantly in the pattern of coupled rotation during 
lateral flexion. Asymmetry in lumbar lateral flexion was highly related to two 
types of pelvic asymmetry: lateral pelvic tilt (LPT) and iliac rotation 
asymmetry (IRA). Asymmetry in lumbar axial rotation was highly related to IRA 
but weakly related to LPT.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates objective differences in patterns of lumbar 
movement between asymptomatic subjects and patients with LBP. The study also 
demonstrates that subtle anatomic abnormality in the pelvis is associated with 
altered mechanics in the lumbar spine. We suggest that asymmetry of lumbar 
movement may be a better indicator of functional deficit than the absolute range 
of movement in LBP.

Low back pain: prediction of short-term outcome of facet joint injection with 
bone scintigraphy.

Radiology, Baylor College of Medicine; 6550 Fannin, Suite 2525, Houston, TX

PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate use of bone scintigraphy with single photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT) for identification of patients with low 
back pain who would benefit from facet joint injections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protocol was reviewed and approved by the 
institutional review board. All patients provided informed consent. Forty-seven 
patients (23 men and 24 women) with low back pain, who were scheduled for facet 
joint injections, were prospectively enrolled and randomized into groups A and B 
(mean ages, 43.3 and 44.2 years, respectively) with a group A-group B ratio of 
2:1. Group A patients underwent bone scintigraphy with SPECT prior to injection. 
Group A patients with bone scans positive for facet joint abnormalities received 
injections at the levels where abnormalities were identified on the scan (group 
A1). Group A patients with negative scans (group A2) received injections at the 
levels that were decided as in group B. Group B patients received injections at 
the levels indicated by the referring physician and did not undergo bone 
scintigraphy. All patients completed a pain and function questionnaire before 
injection and at 1, 3, and 6 months afterward. The change in the American 
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons pain scores after 1, 3, and 6 months compared 
with baseline scores was analyzed with analysis of variance and post hoc 
Bonferroni multiple-comparison tests between groups. Cost analysis was 
performed.
RESULTS: The change in the pain score at 1 month was significantly higher (P < 
.004) in group A1 than it was in the other two groups. In group A1, 13 of 15 
patients had improvement in pain score of greater than 1 standard deviation at 1 
month, whereas improvement occurred in only two of 16 patients in group A2 and 
five of 16 patients in group B. In patients with positive scans, the number of 
facets treated with injection was decreased from 60, which was the number 
originally indicated by the referring physician, to 27. The Medicare cost was 
reduced from $2191 per patient to $1865 with the use of SPECT.
CONCLUSION: Bone scintigraphy with SPECT can help identify patients with low 
back pain who would benefit from facet joint injections.

Interobserver reliability in the interpretation of diagnostic lumbar MRI and 
nuclear imaging.

Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, 68198-1080, USA. Dmulco1@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Assessment of patients with complaints of low back or leg 
pain varies with the subspecialty of the treating physician. The evaluation of 
the spine patient may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, or 
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. The interpretation 
of these tests and the examiner's biases will impact the outcome of patient 
treatment and the cost to the health-care system.
PURPOSE: To evaluate interobserver reliability of MRI and nuclear imaging 
studies and determine the predictability of nuclear medicine results based upon 
MRI findings.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective radiographic review for patients with low 
back pain. MRI, planar bone scan imaging, and SPECT imaging techniques were 
evaluated.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Seventeen patients (80 lumbar levels) who presented to an 
orthopedic spine specialist with a complaint of mechanical low back or leg pain 
were randomly selected. Inclusion criteria were age greater than 21 years and a 
workup that included MRI, bone scan, and SPECT scan images.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Interobserver reliability was determined using kappa values 
(0.6 to <0.8=substantial; 0.8-1=perfect). Interobserver reliability was 
evaluated for all studies and compared with a "group consensus."
METHODS: A team of orthopedists and radiologists of varying experience levels 
were assembled to interpret the imaging studies. All readings were performed 
independently followed by group interpretation and discussion. The reviewers 
were asked to assess each lumbar level (L1-L2 through L5-S1). Phase one: Is the 
level degenerative? Is there a spondylolisthesis present? Does the level have 
Modic changes on MRI? Phase two: Based on the MRI, will the planar bone scan be 
positive? After this prediction, was the planar scan positive? Identify the 
lesion location (anterior column vs. posterior column). Phase three: Based on 
their assessment and predicted results on planar bone scan, was the SPECT scan 
able to improve this assessment?
RESULTS: High kappa values were demonstrated in the identification of a 
degenerative disc, spondylolisthesis, and Modic change (0.773, 0.728, and 0.669, 
respectively). Bone scan and SPECT scan yielded poorer kappa results (0.539 and 
0.460, respectively). Reviewer-predicted bone scan results demonstrated a 
positive predictive value of 68% and a negative predictive value of 84%. 
Predicated SPECT results were similar (positive predictive value 66% and 
negative predictive value 84%). SPECT identified 24% more lesions in the lumbar 
spine when compared with bone scan.
CONCLUSIONS: MRI interpretation of the lumbar spine is comparable between 
specialties. Nuclear imaging studies (bone scan/SPECT) demonstrated a poorer 
correlation between examiners. The presence of MRI changes enables an accurate 
prediction of bone scan or SPECT scan findings. SPECT scan demonstrates an 
increased sensitivity in the detection of spinal abnormalities and the ability 
to localize a lesion when compared with planar bone scan.

The role of electrodiagnosis in the evaluation of low back pain.

Mulford GJ(1), Cohen SJ.

Author information:
(1)Atlantic Health, 95 Mount Kemble Avenue, Morristown, NJ 07960, USA. 
Gregory.Mulford@Atlantichealth.org

Establishing a specific diagnosis is important in the effective management of 
individuals who present with a complaint of low back pain. Electrodiagnostic 
studies are an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation when the history or 
physical examination suggests that neural structures may contribute as symptom 
generators. Lumbo-sacral radiculopathies, plexopathies, and peripheral nerve 
injuries are of primary concern when evaluating individuals with low back pain, 
and electrodiagnostic studies assist in identifying and quantifying 
neurophysiologic injuries and abnormalities using techniques. A thorough, 
thoughtful, and individualized electrodiagnostic study performed by qualified 
physicians as an extension of a detailed history and physical examination can be 
an important and useful component in the proper evaluation of individuals with 
low back pain.

Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae: incidence in a consecutive patient series.

Delport EG(1), Cucuzzella TR, Kim N, Marley J, Pruitt C, Delport AG.

Author information:
(1)Christiana Spine Center, Newark, Delaware, USA.

BACKGROUND: Great variability exists in the reported frequency of transitional 
vertebra in the general population as well as in symptomatic lumbar spine 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence rate of transitional vertebra in 
consecutive lumbar spine patients in our practice.
DESIGN: A prospective, observational study
METHODS: Plain films were viewed and the presence or absence of a lumbar 
transitional vertebra was documented. Transitional vertebrae were classified as 
incomplete or complete.
RESULTS: Of the 300 consecutive patients, 30% had a transitional vertebra.
CONCLUSION: Our percentage of patients with a transitional vertebra was higher 
than the percentages reported for the general population. This supports our 
belief that the alteration in mechanics caused by a transitional vertebra may at 
times contribute to pain generation. Additionally, as a transitional segment may 
not always be visualized on MRI, obtaining plain films prior to an injection or 
surgery will help prevent confusion over the appropriate level for the 
procedure.

Comment in
    Arthritis Res Ther. 2008;10(6):408; author reply 409.

Fibromyalgia (FM) pain is frequent in the general population but its 
pathogenesis is only poorly understood. Many recent studies have emphasized the 
role of central nervous system pain processing abnormalities in FM, including 
central sensitization and inadequate pain inhibition. However, increasing 
evidence points towards peripheral tissues as relevant contributors of painful 
impulse input that might either initiate or maintain central sensitization, or 
both. It is well known that persistent or intense nociception can lead to 
neuroplastic changes in the spinal cord and brain, resulting in central 
sensitization and pain. This mechanism represents a hallmark of FM and many 
other chronic pain syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, 
temporomandibular disorder, migraine, and low back pain. Importantly, after 
central sensitization has been established only minimal nociceptive input is 
required for the maintenance of the chronic pain state. Additional factors, 
including pain related negative affect and poor sleep have been shown to 
significantly contribute to clinical FM pain. Better understanding of these 
mechanisms and their relationship to central sensitization and clinical pain 
will provide new approaches for the prevention and treatment of FM and other 
chronic pain syndromes.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a structured physical examination protocol that 
identifies common biomechanical and soft-tissue abnormalities for older adults 
with chronic low back pain (CLBP) that can be used as a triage tool for 
healthcare providers and to test the interobserver reliability and discriminant 
validity of this protocol.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey and examination.
SETTING: Older adult pain clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eleven community-dwelling adults aged 60 and older 
with CLBP and 20 who were pain-free.
MEASUREMENTS: Clinical history for demographics, pain duration, previous lumbar 
surgery or advanced imaging, neurogenic claudication, and imaging clinically 
serious symptoms. Physical examination for scoliosis, functional leg length 
discrepancy, pain with lumbar movement, myofascial pain (paralumbar, piriformis, 
tensor fasciae latae (TFL)), regional bone pain (sacroiliac joint (SIJ), hip, 
vertebral body), and fibromyalgia.
RESULTS: Scoliosis was prevalent in those with (77.5%) and without pain (60.0%), 
but prevalence of SIJ pain (84% vs 5%), fibromyalgia tender points (19% vs 0%), 
myofascial pain (96% vs 10%), and hip pain (48% vs 0%) was significantly 
different between groups (P < .001). Interrater reliability was excellent for 
SIJ pain (0.81), number of fibromyalgia tender points (0.84), and TFL pain 
(0.81); good for scoliosis (0.43), kyphosis (0.66), lumbar movement pain (0.75), 
piriformis pain (0.71), and hip disease by internal rotation (0.56); and 
marginal for leg length (0.00) and paravertebral pain (0.39).
CONCLUSION: Biomechanical and soft tissue pathologies are common in older adults 
with CLBP, and many can be assessed reliably using a brief physical examination. 
Their recognition may save unnecessary healthcare expenditure and patient 
suffering.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical impact of coronal 
oblique imaging of the lumbrosacral junction and the sacrum at initial 
presentation for MR imaging of the lumbar spine in patients presenting with low 
back pain or sciatic pain. Two hundred and sixty consecutive patients attending 
for MRI of the lumbar spine underwent simultaneous coronal oblique turbo short 
tau inversion recovery (STIR; TR 2500, TE 40, TI 150, echo train length 7, 
number of scan acquisitions 2) imaging of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints 
with a field of view of 30-cm and 3-mm slices (acquisition time 3 min and 20 s). 
Images were reviewed by two experienced radiologists to determine the cause of 
back pain, with and without images of the sacrum and sacroiliac joints. The 
added value of the additional sequence was assessed. Correlation was made with 
surgery, response to nerve root injection or clinical follow-up at 3 months. 
Subgroup analysis was performed to determine if patient stratification according 
to sex or symptoms would be useful. In total, in 19 of 260 patients (7.3%), 
abnormalities were identified at coronal STIR imaging. In 7 of 260 patients 
(2.7%), pathology was identified in the sacrum thought to account for back pain, 
altering the diagnosis made on the standard sequences. These diagnoses were 
sacroiliitis (n=2), sacral stress fracture (n=1), degenerative sacroiliac joints 
(n=1), degenerative accessory articulation between the lumbar spine and the 
sacrum (n=1), Tarlov cyst of nerve root (n=1) and retroverted uterus causing 
sciatic pain (n=1). Patient stratification according to sex or the presence or 
absence of sciatic symptoms was not useful in predicting the added benefit of 
the additional sequence. Routine coronal STIR imaging of the sacrum as part of 
lumbar spine MRI improves assessment of patients presenting with low back pain 
or sciatica in only a small number of patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic herniated 
discs and root compression in patients with lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS) 
and to correlate clinical localization with MRI findings.
METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with unilateral LRS were included in the study. 
Using the visual analogue scale, two physicians independently localized the most 
likely lumbar level of complaints. These clinical predictions of localizations 
were correlated with the MRI findings.
RESULTS: MRI showed abnormalities on the symptomatic side in 42 of 57 patients 
(74%). In 30% of the patients, MRI confirmed an abnormality at the exact same 
level as determined after clinical examination. On the asymptomatic side, MRI 
showed abnormalities in 19 of 57 patients (33%), 13 (23%) of these patients had 
asymptomatic root compression.
CONCLUSIONS: In more than two-thirds of the patients with unilateral LRS there 
was no exact match between the level predicted by clinical examination and MRI 
findings. These discrepancies complicate the decision whether or not to operate.

A cross-sectional study comparing pain and disability levels in patients with 
low back pain with and without transitional lumbosacral vertebrae.

Ontario, Canada. cpeterson@cmcc.ca

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients with transitional lumbosacral vertebrae 
report more pain and disability compared with patients with normal lumbar 
vertebrae.
METHODS: Radiographic and questionnaire data were collected from 353 patients 
with low back pain. Back pain severity was measured using 2 scales: one for pain 
over the entire episode and the other for pain during the previous week. All 
patients completed the Revised Oswestry Disability Questionnaire before 
radiography was performed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with and 
those without a transitional lumbosacral vertebra. Differences between patient 
groups were investigated using the unpaired t test. Multiple linear regression 
analysis was applied to investigate the effect of the transitional lumbosacral 
vertebrae on pain and disability controlling for the effects of age and sex.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients (12.2%) had a transitional lumbosacral vertebra. 
There were no differences in pain or disability levels between the 2 groups on 
any of the pain scales or Revised Oswestry subscales. Older patients reported 
significantly more pain (P = .039) and disability (P = .002) than younger 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a transitional lumbosacral vertebra in this group 
of patients was not related to an increased level of reported low back pain or 
disability.

Chemotherapy dosing with elevated liver function test results in acute leukemia.

Comeau TB(1), Phillips DL.

Author information:

Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, The University of North Carolina, Chapel 
Hill, NC, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of massive blast infiltration of the liver by acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) manifested by worsening liver function test (LFT) 
results and concern over how to dose chemotherapy in this patient.
CASE SUMMARY: A 36-year-old male presenting with productive cough, abdominal 
pain, and lower back pain was diagnosed with pre-B cell ALL. Of note, the 
patient developed worsening LFT results within the first few days of diagnosis. 
Because of concern over increasing liver dysfunction and the need to administer 
vincristine and daunorubicin with induction therapy, a transvenous liver biopsy 
was performed, revealing massive lymphoblast infiltration.
DISCUSSION: A short course of prednisone was given to determine whether the LFT 
abnormalities would reverse with treatment. Once a downward trend in the 
abnormalities was noted, full-dose induction chemotherapy was administered.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to discern the cause of elevated LFT values in 
patients with acute leukemia who require induction chemotherapy, as this may 
affect treatment decisions and patient outcomes.

Decline in physical activity, disability and pain-related fear in sub-acute low 
back pain.

Knottnerus JA.

Netherlands. j.verbunt@srl.nl

AIM OF INVESTIGATION: To evaluate whether a perceived decline in the level of 
physical activity after the onset of pain (PAD) is more appropriate in the 
explanation of disability as compared to the actual level of physical activity 
(PAL) in patients with sub-acute back pain.
METHODS: Patients with 4-7 weeks of non-specific low back pain (LBP) 
participated in this study. Their habitual physical activity level before the 
back pain started (H-PAL), their actual level of physical activity (PAL) and 
their perceived decline in the level of physical activity after the onset of 
pain (PAD) were assessed. The association between these physical activity 
related variables and perceived disability (QBPDS), fear of movement/(re)injury 
(TSK), pain catastrophizing (PCS) and pain intensity (VAS) was examined. The 
role of PAD as a mediator in the association between fear of movement/(re)injury 
and disability was examined by three linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: 123 patients (66 male and 57 female) with a mean age of 44.1 years 
(SD=10.3) participated in this study. PAD was significantly correlated with 
disability, fear of movement/(re)injury, pain catastrophizing and pain 
intensity. PAD and PAL appeared more important in the explanation of disability 
in the subgroup of patients who were physically active before their back pain 
started. Generally, PAD indeed mediated the association between fear of 
movement/(re)injury and disability.
CONCLUSIONS: The perceived decline in physical activity, rather than the current 
physical activity itself is important in the evaluation of the impact of 
activity related changes on disability in low back pain.

To describe the characteristics of pain experienced by patients with 
interstitial cystitis (IC) in terms of pain site, severity, and character, we 
performed a secondary analysis of data from the IC database (ICDB), which was a 
prospective, longitudinal, cohort study of IC patients. We analyzed the 
cross-sectional baseline data from 629 patients who had a completed baseline 
symptom questionnaire. Patients answered questions about whether they had pain 
or discomfort associated with urinary symptoms over the past 4 weeks and if so, 
about the location, characteristics, intensity, and frequency of their pain. 
Logistic regression examined associations between pain location and the presence 
of urinary symptoms. Analyses were performed using SAS version 8.2 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and considered significant at the 5% level. Five 
hundred and eighty-nine (94%) patients with a mean age of 45 years (SD 14 years) 
reported baseline pain or discomfort associated with their urinary symptoms. The 
most common baseline pain site was lower abdominal (80%), with urethral (74%) 
and low back pain (65%) also commonly reported. The majority of patients 
described their pain as intermittent, regardless of the pain site. Most patients 
reported moderate pain intensity, across all pain sites. There was a 
statistically significant link between pain in the urethra, lower back, and 
lower abdomen, and urinary symptoms. Patients with IC report pain at several 
sites other than the bladder, possibly arising from the previously 
well-described myofascial abnormalities of pelvic floor and abdominal wall 
present in patients with IC and other chronic pelvic pain syndromes.

Pathophysiology of disk-related low back pain and sciatica. II. Evidence 
supporting treatment with TNF-alpha antagonists.

Therapeutic Antibodies (IPGA), France.

Strong evidence suggests that TNF-alpha may be among the chemical factors 
involved in disk-related sciatica. TNF-alpha is involved in the genesis of nerve 
pain in animal models and may promote pain-signal production from nerve roots 
previously subjected to mechanical deformation. In animal experiments, TNF-alpha 
has been identified in nucleus pulposus and Schwann cells. Local production of 
endogenous TNF-alpha may occur early in the pathogenic process. Exposure to 
exogenous TNF-alpha induces electrophysiological, histological, and behavioral 
changes similar to those seen after exposure to nucleus pulposus, and these 
changes are more severe when mechanical compression is applied concomitantly. 
TNF-alpha antagonists diminish or abolish abnormalities in animal models. Other 
cytokines may be involved also, as suggested by the potent inhibitory effects of 
compounds such as doxycycline. Two open-label studies in humans suggest dramatic 
efficacy of TNF-alpha antagonists in alleviating disk-related sciatica. In 
contrast, the results of the only controlled study available to date do not 
support a therapeutic effect of TNF-alpha antagonists. Thus, whether TNF-alpha 
antagonist therapy is warranted in patients with disk-related sciatica remains 
an open question, and further randomized controlled studies are needed.

Use of lumbosacral region manipulation and therapeutic exercises for a patient 
with a lumbosacral transitional vertebra and low back pain.

Brenner AK(1).

Alexander.Brenner@us.army.mil

STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
BACKGROUND: A lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LTV) is a congenital anomaly 
that occurs in 3% to 21% of people with and without low back pain (LBP). There 
is lack of agreement in the literature as to whether or not the presence of a 
LTV may cause LBP. The objective of this case report is to present the use of 
lumbosacral region manipulation and therapeutic exercises on a patient with a 
known LTV and LBP.
CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case report, an active-duty US Army soldier was 
referred to physical therapy with right-sided LBP and a lumbar radiograph 
showing a hemisacralized transitional L5 vertebra on the same side as his pain. 
The patient was treated with lumbosacral region manipulation and flexion 
exercises aimed at regaining total spinal motion and reducing pain. The patient 
responded favorably to spinal manipulation and exercise and was discharged from 
physical therapy after 4 visits. A modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability 
Questionnaire and inclinometer were used to measure outcome after physical 
therapy intervention.
OUTCOMES: After a 2-week period of treatment in physical therapy, the patient 
improved from an initial Oswestry score of 32% to a score of 4%. Forward bending 
and left side bending improved from 74 degrees to 140 degrees and from 21 
degrees to 45 degrees, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Lumbosacral region manipulation along with therapeutic exercises 
appears to have been an effective treatment approach for this patient with LBP 
associated with a type IIA LTV.

Improvement in automatic postural coordination following alexander technique 
lessons in a person with low back pain.

Cacciatore TW(1), Horak FB, Henry SM.

Author information:
(1)Neurological Sciences Institute, Oregon Health and Sciences University, 
Portland, OR, USA. cacciato@ohsu.edu

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The relationship between abnormal postural coordination 
and back pain is unclear. The Alexander Technique (AT) aims to improve postural 
coordination by using conscious processes to alter automatic postural 
coordination and ongoing muscular activity, and it has been reported to reduce 
low back pain. This case report describes the use of the AT with a client with 
low back pain and the observed changes in automatic postural responses and back 
pain.
CASE DESCRIPTION: The client was a 49-year-old woman with a 25-year history of 
left-sided, idiopathic, lumbrosacral back pain. Automatic postural coordination 
was measured using a force plate during horizontal platform translations and 
one-legged standing.
OUTCOMES: The client was tested monthly for 4 months before AT lessons and for 3 
months after lessons. Before lessons, she consistently had laterally asymmetric 
automatic postural responses to translations. After AT lessons, the magnitude 
and asymmetry of her responses and balance improved and her low back pain 
decreased.
DISCUSSION: Further research is warranted to study whether AT lessons improve 
low back pain-associated abnormalities in automatic postural coordination and 
whether improving automatic postural coordination helps to reduce low back pain.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, Kangnam St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University 
of Korea, 505 Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, 137-701 Seoul, Korea.

OBJECTIVE: To correlate MR and CT discography findings with pain response at 
provocative discography in patients with discogenic back pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients aged 25-54 years who underwent MR 
imaging and subsequent CT discography (97 discs) were included in this study. MR 
images were retrospectively evaluated regarding disc degeneration, endplate 
abnormalities, facet joint osteoarthritis, and high intensity zone. During 
discography concordant pain was regarded as positive, whereas discordant pain 
and no pain were regarded as negative. MR and CT discographic findings were 
analyzed on the base of concordant pain using the Chi-square test.
RESULTS: : Concordant pain was significantly common in the following (P < 0.05): 
grade 4 or 5 disc degeneration [88% (30/34) in concordant pain versus 48% 
(30/63) in discordant pain and no pain], high intensity zone [56% (19/34) versus 
30% (19/63)], combination of above two findings [53% (18/34) versus 25% 
(16/63)], fissured and ruptured disc at discogram [94% (32/34) versus 57% 
(36/63)], and contrast beyond inner annulus at CT discogram [97% (33/34) versus 
57% (36/63)].
CONCLUSION: Typical MR findings with concordant pain at discography include 
grade 4 or 5 disc degeneration and presence of a high intensity zone. Typical CT 
discography findings with concordant pain were fissured/ruptured discs and 
contrast extending into/beyond the outer annulus on CT.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between prevalent 
radiographic abnormalities of the lumbar spine and the incidence of low back 
pain in high school rugby players. Three hundred and twenty-seven incoming high 
school rugby players (15-16 years of age) were recruited between 1986 and 1994. 
All of them underwent athletic physical examination before participation in high 
school athletics. The relationship between prevalent radiographic abnormalities 
of the lumbar spine in the pre-participation athletic physical examination and 
the incidence of low back pain during a 1-year period after the start of 
participation in athletics was analyzed. Radiographic abnormalities assessed 
were spondylolysis, disc space narrowing, spinal instability, Schmorl's node, 
balloon disc, and spina bifida occulta. The frequency of respective radiographic 
abnormalities was 15.6%, 13.1%, 32.7%, 14.1%, 11.6%, and 30.6%. Two hundred and 
forty-three players (74.3%) had at least one of these radiographic 
abnormalities. The incidence of low back pain was 44.0% in players with no such 
radiographic abnormalities and 41.2% in those with at least one radiographic 
abnormality. The incidence of low back pain in players with the respective 
radiographic abnormalities was 72.5%, 46.5%, 46.7%, 39.1%, 34.2%, and 41.0%, and 
only players with spondylolysis had a significantly higher incidence of low back 
pain than those with no radiographic abnormalities. This study shows that a 
radiographic abnormality, specifically spondylolysis, is a significant 
radiological risk factor for low back pain in high school rugby players.

Author information:
(1)Neurosurgery, Department of Neuroscience, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 
81-00133 Rome, Italy.

STUDY DESIGN: Cystic dilatation of the fifth ventricle on its own is an 
extremely rare pathological event in adults whose pathogenesis is uncertain. The 
authors describe a personal case of 'fifth ventricle' and review the pertinent 
literature.
OBJECTIVE: To emphasize the importance of including the fifth ventricle in 
differential diagnosis of lesions of the conus medullaris to ensure proper 
treatment.
SETTING: Italy.
METHODS: A 30-year-old woman was referred to us for recurrent low back pain. The 
patient was assessed by clinical, electrophysiological (motor evoked potential, 
somatosensorial evoked potential and electromyography of the perineal and lower 
limb muscles) and urodynamic investigations as well as a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the lumbar-sacral segment with and without gadolinium 
enhancement, subsequently extended to the entire vertebral column and brain. 
Follow-up consisted of periodic clinical evaluation and lumbar-sacral MRI after 
1 and 2 years.
RESULTS: General physical examination, electrophysiological and urodynamic 
investigations were all negative, confirming the subjective nature of the 
patient's symptoms. Lumbar-sacral MRI demonstrated the presence of a cyst lesion 
containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which did not enhance after gadolinium, 
compatible with the diagnosis of the terminal ventricle. By extending the MRI 
investigation to the entire vertebral column and brain, it was possible to 
exclude an association with other malformations of the central nervous system. 
Clinical and radiological follow-up confirmed the nonevolutive nature of the 
lesion 1 and 2 years later.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of clinical symptoms and the stability of the radiological 
situation at 1 and 2 years follow-up motivated our choice of conservative 
treatment.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study of a general population.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate "abnormal" lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) findings, and their prevalence and associations with low back pain (LBP).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The clinical relevance of various "abnormal" 
findings in the lumbar spine is unclear. Distinguishing between inevitable 
age-related findings and degenerative findings with deleterious consequences is 
a challenge.
METHODS: Lumbar spine MRI was obtained in 412, 40-year-old individuals. 
Predefined "abnormal" MRI findings were interpreted without any knowledge of 
patient symptoms. Associations between MRI abnormalities and LBP were calculated 
using odds ratios. The "overall picture" of each MRI finding was established on 
the basis of the frequencies, diagnostic values, and the strength and 
consistency of associations.
RESULTS: Most "abnormal" MRI findings were found at the lowest lumbar levels. 
Irregular nucleus shape and reduced disc height were common (>50% of 
individuals). Relatively common (25% to 50%) were hypointense disc signal, 
anular tears, high intensity zones, disc protrusions, endplate changes, 
zygapophyseal joint degeneration, asymmetry, and foraminal stenosis. Nerve root 
compromise, Modic changes, central spinal stenosis, and 
anterolisthesis/retrolisthesis were rare (<25%). Most strongly associated with 
LBP were Modic changes and anterolisthesis (odds ratios >4). Significantly 
positive associations with all LBP variables were seen for hypointense disc 
signals, reduced disc height, and Modic changes. All disc "abnormalities" except 
protrusion were moderately associated with LBP during the past year.
CONCLUSION: Most degenerative disc "abnormalities" were moderately associated 
with LBP. The strongest associations were noted for Modic changes and 
anterolisthesis. Further studies are needed to define clinical relevance.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty (IDET) is a 
minimally invasive procedure for managing chronic discogenic low back pain 
(LBP). Although there have been numerous reports of IDET outcome rates, few have 
dissected the detailed factors affecting those outcomes.
PURPOSE: To evaluate how heating variables and the number of catheters used 
affect the outcomes and pain flare-up in LBP patients treated with IDET.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective analysis.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Data were gathered on the basis of chart records from January 6, 
1999 to January 6, 2000. Twenty-five cases treated at a single level with disc 
protrusion < or = 2 mm, nonfocal neurological abnormalities, and positive 
discogram with annular tear were studied. Six patients were unavailable for 
follow-up at 16 months.
OUTCOME MEASURES: All assessments were incorporated into our own evaluation 
sheet, completed before the procedure and at follow-up. Assessments included the 
following: 1) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and 2) Back Pain Improvement Scales 
(BPI) preoperatively and at 8 and 16 months post-procedure. Post-procedure 
flare-up of the pain was defined as the pain aggravation after the IDET 
procedure from the pre-procedure baseline pain. It was evaluated by a 10-point 
numeric rating scale, ranging from no aggravated pain "0" to the worst 
aggravated pain "10".
METHODS: Patients were partitioned into a single-catheter group and a 
double-catheter group. In these two groups, statistical analyses were done to 
compare the outcomes and flare-up duration and intensity. In each catheter 
group, the correlation coefficients were analyzed between heating variables such 
as heating duration/temperature and two outcome scales. Then, two outcome scales 
relative to intensity and duration of post-IDET flare-up were analyzed with 
Pearson's correlation. Also the combined effect of the heating duration and 
temperature was evaluated as a thermal dosage, which is the total amount of heat 
developed during the procedure. It was calculated by multiplying the temperature 
and its heating duration above a starting temperature of 65 degrees C.
RESULTS: Comparing the single- and double-catheter groups, patients placed in 
the single-catheter group showed significantly shorter flare-up duration 
(11.00+/-19.17 vs. 24.89+/-20.84 days, p < .05). In the single-catheter group, 
the flare-up duration manifested moderate linear correlation with heating 
variables (0.580 with temperature, 0.519 with thermal dosage, p < .05). Also, 
the improvements of pain with VAS displayed moderate reverse correlation with 
heating variables at 8 months (-.436 with temperature, -0.439 with thermal 
dosage, p < .1). In the double-catheter group, the Back Pain Improvement% had 
strong reverse correlations with temperature and thermal dosage at 8 months 
(-.735 and -.729, p < .05). The correlation between the improvement of VAS and 
temperature yielded a moderate reverse relationship (-.619, p < 0.1). These 
correlations were not, however, observed at 16 months in either the single- or 
double-catheter groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher temperatures and larger total heating doses during IDET 
procedures with catheters placed in the outer annulus may increase the duration 
of post-procedure pain flare-ups and lead to less favorable outcomes at 8 months 
follow-up. The long-term outcomes at 16 months may, however, not be affected by 
these heating variables.

Solid-pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas is a rare benign or low-grade 
malignant epithelial tumour; its association with pancreatic dorsal agenesis has 
been reported only once before. We present the radiological and histological 
findings of a case of pancreatic solid-pseudopapillary tumour associated with 
total pancreatic dorsal agenesis. A 49-year-old woman presented with abdominal 
pain radiating to the back for several months. Radiological findings showed 
absence of the dorsal pancreas and an 8 cm x 6 cm diameter tumour arising from 
the head of the pancreas. She underwent successful complete resection of the 
tumour. Histopathology revealed a diagnosis of solid-pseudopapillary tumour.

Academy, Etlik-Ankara, Turkey. matask@gata.edu.tr

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of congenital lumbosacral 
malformations in young male patients with subacute or chronic low back pain and 
to investigate a possible worsening of the clinical picture with the concurrence 
of transitional vertebra (TV) or spina bifida occulta (SBO).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although the causative roles of congenital 
malformations in low back pain and lumbar disc herniation have been 
investigated, there is no study that compares the incidence of congenital 
malformations in prolonged low back pain between radicular and nonradicular 
groups; nor is there a study that compares the pain intensity between the groups 
with and without congenital malformations.
METHODS: Lumbosacral plain radiographs of 881 young male patients with low back 
pain lasting for >4 weeks were evaluated. For all patients, we recorded the 
clinical signs and their pain intensities based on a 10-cm visual analog scale 
(VAS).
RESULTS: Congenital lumbosacral malformations were determined in 88 of 881 
patients. Of these, 48 were TV, 38 were SBO, and 2 were a combined lesion of TV 
and SBO. The difference in positive clinical sign and VAS was statistically 
significant (P < 0.05) between the groups with and without congenital 
lumbosacral malformations. In contrast to SBO, there was a statistically 
significant difference of TV incidence between the sign positive and the sign 
negative groups (P < 0.05). The difference in VAS values was statistically 
significant for both TV and SBO (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that SBO and TV increase the 
severity of the clinical picture whether or not they have a causal relationship. 
Additionally, transitional vertebrae seem to increase nerve-root symptoms 
whereas spina bifida occulta does not.

    J Neurotrauma. 2006 Jun;23(6):1048.

The aim of this study was to explore whether reported pain and functional 
disability in whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) patients is associated with 
lesions to specific soft tissue structures in the upper cervical spine, as 
assessed by MRI. Pre-selected structures for MRI assessment included the alar 
ligaments, the transverse ligament, the tectorial and the posterior 
atlanto-occipital membranes. The questionnaire employed was a modification of 
the Oswestry Low Back Pain Index. It was comprised of ten single items related 
to pain and activity of daily living. Ninety-two whiplash patients and 30 
control persons, randomly drawn, were included. WAD patients reported 
significantly more pain and functional disability than the controls, both for 
total score and each of the ten single items. In the WAD patients, MRI lesions 
to the alar ligaments showed the most consistent association to the reported 
pain and disability. Lesions to other structures often occurred in combination 
with lesions to the alar ligaments. Lesions to the transverse ligament and to 
the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane also appeared to be related to the NDI 
score, although the association was weaker than for the alar ligament. The 
disability score increased with increasing number of abnormal (grade 2-3) 
structures. These results indicate that symptoms and complaints among WAD 
patients can be linked with structural abnormalities in ligaments and membranes 
in the upper cervical spine, in particular the alar ligaments.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study of a general population.
OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between "abnormal" lumbar magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) findings and low back pain (LBP) in 13-year old children.
SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: Very little is known about the distribution of 
lumbar MRI findings and how they are associated with LBP in youngsters.
METHODS: Disc abnormalities, as well as nerve root compromise, endplate changes, 
and anterolisthesis were identified from MRI studies of 439 children. LBP was 
identified from structured interviews. Associations are presented as odds ratios 
(OR).
RESULTS: Signs of disc degeneration were noted in approximately 1/3 of the 
subjects. Reduced signal intensity and irregular nucleus shape in the upper 3 
lumbar discs were significantly associated with LBP within the last month (OR, 
2.5-3.6), whereas reduced signal intensity and disc protrusion at L5-NS1 were 
associated with seeking care (OR, 2.8 and 7.7, respectively). Endplate changes 
in relation to the L3 discs were associated with LBP month and seeking care (OR, 
between 9.7 and 22.2). Anterolisthesis at L5 was associated with seeking care 
(OR, 4.3). There were obvious differences between genders: degenerative disc 
changes in the upper lumbar spine were more strongly associated with LBP in 
boys, while disc abnormalities in the lower lumbar spine were more strongly 
associated with seeking care in girls.
CONCLUSIONS: In children, degenerative disc findings are relatively common, and 
some are associated with LBP. There appears to be a gender difference. Disc 
protrusions, endplate changes, and anterolisthesis in the lumbar spine were 
strongly associated with seeking care for LBP.

The authors describe a rare case of a congenital absence of the right L5 pedicle 
in a 54-year-old man presenting with low back pain and radicular pain of his 
left leg. Plain x-ray films, computed tomography scan (CT) after myelography, 
and three-dimensional CT revealed the absence of the L5 pedicle and anomaly of 
the L4-L5 facet joint on his right side. On the left side, there were severe 
degenerative changes that were thought to be the result of an overload and 
instability. The degenerative changes led to late-onset neurologic impairment of 
the contralateral side, which was treated with spinal fusion. To our knowledge, 
this is the first report of contralateral symptoms due to unilateral defect of 
the facet joint accompanied by aplasia of a pedicle.

BACKGROUND: Athletes with low back pain may have sustained a bone stress injury 
in the lumbar neural arch, including spondylolysis. Single photon emission 
computerized tomography (SPECT) and reverse gantry computerized tomography 
(rg-CT) help localize bone stress response and spondylolyses.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the SPECT and rg-CT findings in those patients suspected 
of suffering from a spondylolysis.
STUDY DESIGN: Large retrospective case series.
SETTING: Secondary and tertiary care center in England.
PATIENTS: A total of 213 patients presenting to the Spinal Unit and Sports 
Medicine Clinics between 1995 and 2000 with low back pain and subsequently 
investigated for spondylolysis by SPECT and rg-CT.
METHODS: An experienced consultant musculoskeletal radiologist reported the 
SPECT and rg-CT, and these results along with data from the patient's medical 
records were analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sites and sides of increased scintigraphic activity in 
the lumbar neural arch seen on SPECT and complete and incomplete spondylolyses 
were recorded.
RESULTS: Single photon emission computerized tomography scan showed increased 
scintigraphic uptake in 145 patients, mostly (42.3%) at L5. Marked increase in 
scintigraphic uptake was noted on the left side of the neural arch in 31 
patients and on the right in 17 (chi; P < 0.05). Spondylolysis was identified on 
rg-CT in 81 patients. Spondylolyses were bilateral on 44 occasions, but 
unilateral lesions occurred in the left pars 36 times and on the right 16 times 
(chi; P < 0.01)
CONCLUSIONS: Spondylolyses were a frequent finding on rg-CT in young athletes 
with low back pain. The sports most commonly associated with this stress 
response in the pars interarticularis were cricket and soccer. The lower lumbar 
levels are more likely to show abnormalities on SPECT and computerized 
tomography. Among those investigated for spondylolysis, left-sided lower lumbar 
pain was more common than right, and a marked increase in scintigraphic uptake 
was noted on the left more often than the right. Although bilateral 
spondylolyses were common, left-sided spondylolyses were more common than right. 
The asymmetric repetitive movements of certain sports may be responsible. In 
particular, fast bowlers developed spondylolysis on the opposite side of the 
body to their bowling arm.

Hamburg, Germany.

The lumbar spine was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 14 children 
(mean age 12.4 years) with unspecific activity-related low back pain for more 
than 3 weeks presenting with normal plain radiographs. Impending spondylolysis 
was diagnosed when typical signal abnormalities were confined to the pars 
interarticularis without signs of thinning or fragmentation. After brace 
treatment for 3 months, follow-up MRI was performed 3 and 6 months after 
treatment. MRI signals returned to normal after 3 months in six patients and 
after 6 months in one patient. MRI showed promising results in detecting and 
monitoring the early onset of spondylolysis. Bracing and avoiding strenuous 
activities prevented the formation of pars defects in all our patients.

Two patients with spinal Langerhans cell granulomatosis were followed by 
magnetic resonance imaging, and the observed signal changes were detailed. Both 
patients had no neurologic abnormalities but back pain. They were treated by 
immobilization with a brace and bed rest. Their back pain disappeared after 
about a month. At the first visit, the tumorous lesions involving vertebrae 
showed mainly low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and high 
intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). They were clearly enhanced by 
gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Their original 
intensities changed to iso-intensities on both T1WI and T2WI without enhancement 
by Gd-DTPA after a year. These signal changes might indicate the healing stage 
of the involved vertebrae and recommend the removal of the spinal brace.

BACKGROUND: Problems of low back and neck pain are were important for persons, 
who decided to participate in sport or to educate and work in jobs requiring 
high accelerations and loads. The aim of the study was evaluate a structure the 
whole spine on magnetic resonansce imaging among airforce candidates.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: MRI of 98 young, healthy persons, with no abnormalities in 
structure and function of musclosceletal system, were analysed.
RESULTS: Analysed material revealed dehydratation of intervertebral discs L4-L5 
and L5-S1 among 23 persons (23.5%). In this group 21 persons (22%) had 
protrusions, while Schmorl nodules were present among 14 (14.7%) persons. Only 
one persons had protrusion in cervical spine. Candidates who had changes in MRI 
were excluded from futher qualifying selection. An exeption was Schmorl nodules 
in thoracal spine due to good stabilisation of this part of spine gained by 
rips.
CONCLUSION: (1) Intervertebral disc degeneration without clinical symptoms were 
found among 23% examined persons and starts in second decade of life. (2) Aboved 
mentioned changes are a serius problem for airforce candidates. (3) Airforce 
candidates, who have degenerative changes in lumbar and cervical spine on MRI 
findings should not be exepted to futher qualifying selection.

Texas passes first law for safe patient handling in America: landmark 
legislation protects health-care workers and patients from injury related to 
manual patient lifting.

Hudson MA(1).

anne@wingusa.org

On June 17,2005, Texas Governor Rick Perry (R) signed into law Senate Bill 1525, 
making Texas the first state in the nation to require hospitals and nursing 
homes to implement safe patient handling and movement programs. Governor Perry 
is to be commended for this heroic first stand for safe patient handling in 
America. The landmark legislation will take effect January 1, 2006, requiring 
the establishment of policy to identify, assess, and develop methods of 
controlling the risk of injury to patients and nurses associated with lifting, 
transferring, repositioning, and movement of patients; evaluation of alternative 
methods from manual lifting to reduce the risk of injury from patient lifting, 
including equipment and patient care environment; restricting, to the extent 
feasible with existing equipment, manual handling of all or most of a patient's 
weight to emergency, life-threatening, or exceptional circumstances; and 
provision for refusal to perform patient handling tasks believed to involve 
unacceptable risks of injury to a patient or nurse. Manually lifting patients 
has been called deplorable, inefficient, dangerous to nurses, and painful and 
brutal to patients; manual lifting can cause needless suffering and injury to 
patients, with dangers including pain, bruising, skin tears, abrasions, tube 
dislodgement, dislocations, fractures, and being dropped by nursing staff during 
attempts to manually lift. Use of safe, secure, mechanical lift equipment and 
gentle friction-reducing devices for patient maneuvering tasks could eliminate 
such needless brutality. Research has proven that manual patient lifting is 
extremely hazardous to health-care workers, creating substantial risk of 
low-back injury, whether with one or two patient handlers. Studies on the use of 
mechanical patient lift equipment, by either nursing staff or lift teams, have 
proven repeatedly that most nursing staff back injury is preventable, leading to 
substantial savings to employers on medical and compensation costs. Because the 
health-care industry has relied on people to do the work of machines, nursing 
work remains the most dangerous occupation for disabling back injury. Back 
injury from patient lifting may be the single largest contributor to the nursing 
shortage, with perhaps 12% of nurses leaving or being terminated because of back 
injury. The US health-care industry has not kept pace with other industries, 
which provide mechanical lift equipment for lifting loads equivalent to the 
weight of patients, or with other countries, such as Australia and England, 
which are more advanced in their use of modern technology for patient lifting 
and with no-lifting practices in compliance with government regulations and 
nursing policies banning manual lifting. With Texas being the first state to 
succeed in passing legislation for safe patient handling, other states are 
working toward legislative protection against injury with manual patient 
lifting. California re-introduced safe patient handling legislation on February 
17, 2005, with CA SB 363, Hospitals: Lift Teams, following the September 22, 
2004, veto of CA AB 2532 by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who said he believes 
existing statutory protection and workplace safety standards are sufficient to 
protect health care workers from injury. Massachusetts HB 2662, Relating to Safe 
Patient Handling in Certain Health Facilities, was introduced December 1, 2004. 
Ohio HB 67, signed March 21, 2005 by Governor Bob Taft (R), creates a program 
for interest-free loans to nursing homes for implementation of a no-manual-lift 
program. New York companion bills AB 7641 and SB 4029 were introduced in April, 
2005, calling for creation of a 2-year study to establish safe patient handling 
programs and collect data on nursing staff and patient injury with manual 
patient handling versus lift equipment, to determine best practices for 
improving health and safety of health-care workers and patients during patient 
handling. Washington State is planning re-introduction of safe patient handling 
legislation, after WA HB 1672, Relating to reducing injuries among patients and 
health care workers, was stalled in committee in February, 2005. Language from 
these state initiatives may be used as models to assist other states with 
drafting safe patient handling legislation. Rapid enactment of a federal mandate 
for Safe Patient Handling No Manual Lift is essential and anticipated.

University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153, USA. mfitz8@lumc.edu

AIMS: Our aim was to describe the location of urinary urgency or bladder 
discomfort in patients with painful bladder syndrome (PBS) and controls.
METHODS: Patients with symptomatic diagnoses of PBS, overactive bladder (OAB) 
syndrome, stress urinary incontinence (SUI), and asymptomatic controls were 
asked to indicate the location of their urinary urge/urgency/discomfort on a 
body map.
RESULTS: We present results for 30 PBS patients, 25 OAB patients, 15 SUI 
patients, and 15 asymptomatic controls. In asymptomatic subjects and those with 
SUI, the urge to void was localized to the suprapubic region only. More than 
half (53%) of patients with PBS and a minority (20%) of those with OAB localized 
their urinary urgency/discomfort to both suprapubic and vulvar/urethral 
locations. Some patients with PBS also localized their urinary discomfort to 
other body sites including low back, upper and lateral buttocks, lower abdomen, 
and upper thighs.
CONCLUSIONS: In most patients with PBS and some with OAB, complaints of bladder 
discomfort or urgency may refer to sensations that are localized at sites other 
than suprapubic. The etiology of widespread sensation may include an expansion 
of dermatomes of referral of bladder sensation, and/or the presence of 
associated somatic abnormalities.

Myofascial pain mimicking radicular syndromes.

Facco E(1), Ceccherelli F.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pharmacology and Anesthesiology, University of Padua, Padua, 
Italy. enrico.facco@unipd.it

Myofascial pain is very often underscored and misunderstood in clinical 
practice. In many cases the localization of myofascial pain may resemble other 
diseases, such as radicular syndromes (e.g., low back pain from herniated disc) 
and even diseases of internal organs (e.g., angina pectoris, bowel diseases or 
gynaecological disturbances). In pain clinics one can routinely see patients 
with myofascial painful disorders showing a radicular topography and normal CT 
and MRI: as a consequence, when vertebral abnormalities are present on CT or 
MRI, it should be checked whether the cause of pain is radicular, myofascial, or 
both. On the other hand, the conventional approach to painful disorders may lead 
to errors and wrong diagnosis, depending on several factors: a) pain is often 
considered a symptom of an organic disease; b) the diagnosis is usually directed 
towards the structural cause of pain only; c) the functional components of the 
suffering patient are underscored; d) the site of pain may introduce some bias. 
When the latter is concerned, it is usually admitted that a neck pain may depend 
on muscle contraction (e.g. torticollis), while such a cause is less commonly 
admitted for leg, where the attention is first directed towards the sciatic 
nerve; myofascial origin of pain is even less considered in abdominal or pelvic 
painful disorders, where patients with no structural detectable diseases are 
often considered as neurotic and referred to the psychiatrist. The reason for 
this topographical dependence of diagnosis lies in the conventional attitude to 
focus on the most relevant and frequent organic diseases, thus introducing a 
bias with relevant epistemological implications.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective trial of preoperative MRI study in patients with 
"idiopathic" scoliosis.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of neural axis malformations and the 
clinical relevance of MRI in the evaluation of patients with idiopathic 
scoliosis undergoing surgical intervention.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: With the development of MRI, neural axis 
abnormalities such as syringomyelia or Chiari malformations are increasingly 
being found in patients with "idiopathic" scoliosis. The risk of neurologic 
complications during correction of scoliosis without prior decompression surgery 
for syringomyelia has been documented; however, there have been no prospective 
studies for identifying the risk of neurologic complications as a result of 
scoliosis surgery in patients with asymptomatic neural axis malformations.
METHODS: A total of 250 patients who were classified as having "idiopathic" 
scoliosis at first presentation and admitted for spinal surgery were evaluated. 
All patients were examined for neural axis abnormalities using MRI. The presence 
of neurologic symptoms and abnormal neurologic signs was also examined before 
and after surgical intervention. Neurologic complications during scoliosis 
surgery were reviewed in patients with neural axis abnormalities.
RESULTS: There were 44 (18%) patients (13 males and 31 females) who had neural 
axis abnormalities on MRI, including syringomyelia with Chiari malformations in 
22 patients, syringomyelia with tonsillar ectopia in 2, Chiari malformations in 
13, tonsillar ectopia in 6, and low conus medullaris in 1. On clinical 
examination, 44 (18%) patients had abnormal neurologic signs and 26 (7%) 
patients complained of headache or back pain. There were significant differences 
between patients with and without neural axis abnormalities regarding the age at 
first visit, gender, curve pattern, sagittal profile of thoracic spine, presence 
of neurologic deficit, and complaint of pain. Only 12 of 44 patients needed 
neurosurgical treatment for foramen magnum decompression before correction of 
scoliosis. Neurologic status temporarily worsened in 3 patients, including 2 
patients with neurosurgical treatment and 1 patient without neurosurgical 
treatment; however, there were no permanent neurologic complications as a result 
of scoliosis surgery. All patients without neurologic deficits or complaints of 
pain did not receive neurosurgical treatment, while they had no permanent 
neurologic complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Foramen magnum decompression for neural axis malformations could 
prevent permanent neurologic complications during scoliosis surgery. There is 
little risk of neurologic complications in patients with "idiopathic" scoliosis 
whose neurologic status is normal, even if these patients have a neural axis 
malformation on MRI.

Fractures of the lumbar and sacral superior articular processes: report of two 
cases.

Numoto RT(1), Takeda M, Tani S, Abe T.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurosurgery, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, 
Japan.

OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Injury to the posterior vertebral elements of the 
lumbar spine represents a common cause of lower back pain in athletes. However, 
associations between nontraumatic fracture, nonathletic populations, and 
treatment remain poorly described. Diagnosis and treatment of two extremely rare 
symptomatic fractures of the superior articular process are discussed.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two male nonathletes presented with sudden lower back and 
leg pain after usual daily activities. No obvious abnormalities were revealed by 
radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or myelography.
INTERVENTION: In both patients, small fractures of the superior articular facet 
compressing the root shoulder were recognized after further examination, 
including detailed neurological evaluation of symptoms and targeted thin-slice 
computed tomography. After failure of conservative treatment, surgical 
debridement and removal of nonunion fracture were accomplished.
CONCLUSION: Symptoms were resolved surgically without further complications or 
rehabilitation. Fractures of the superior articular facet causing intolerable 
lower back and sciatic leg pain are rare. We present the first reported cases of 
these fractures.

A case of systemic mastocytosis associated with severe osteoporosis and 
pathologic fractures.

We describe the case of a 56-year-old man with rapidly progressive osteoporosis 
culminating in pathologic fractures of multiple lumbar vertebrae. With the 
exception of discrete brown-reddish cutaneous lesions, low back pain was the 
only prominent symptom. Laboratory evaluations excluded metabolic or 
endocrinological abnormalities. Serum tryptase was highly increased, as was 
urinary excretion of histamine. Iliac crest biopsy demonstrated mastocytosis, 
which was confirmed by skin biopsy and which was consistent with teleangiectasia 
macularis eruptiva perstans, a rare form of cutaneous mastocytosis. In cases of 
unusually marked osteoporosis, especially in men, mastocytosis should be 
considered in the differential diagnosis.

[The natural history of congenital defects and deformities of the spine (I)].

[Article in German]

Münster.

The functional assessment of individuals with congenital defects of the spine 
requires a differentiated judgement. A lumbalisation or sacralisation of the 
lumbosacral junction does not seem to be associated with increased lower back 
pain. However, it remains unclear whether this is the case in individuals with a 
spina bifida occulta. Defects of segmentation or formation alter the 
biomechanical loading of the spine, especially in cases of a secondary spinal 
deformity the functional status can be substantially impaired. Spinal 
deformities include idiopathic scoliosis, Scheuermanns kyphosis and 
spondylolisthesis. Depending on the severity of the deformity, they can affect 
the functional status and may be associated with increased lower back pain.

Epidural abscess and discitis complicating instrumented posterior lumbar 
interbody fusion: a case report.

STUDY DESIGN: A case of epidural abscess and discitis following instrumented 
PLIF using a single carbon fiber interbody cage is presented.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a previously unreported complication of epidural abscess 
and discitis following posterior lumbar interbody fusion using a single carbon 
fiber cage.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Various complications have been reported with PLIF. 
These include graft migration, pseudarthrosis, implant subsidence, epidural 
hemorrhage, incidental durotomy, arachnoiditis, transient or permanent 
neurologic deficits, persistence of pain, and wound infections. There are no 
reported cases of epidural abscess or refractory discitis associated with PLIF.
METHODS: A 35-year-old infantryman on active duty with chronic low back pain and 
single-level lumbar disc degeneration underwent instrumented PLIF after 
reporting no improvement with 3 years of extension-based physical therapy and 
nonsteroidal pain medications. His back pain was reported improved at 6 weeks 
after surgery. At 12 weeks after surgery, he presented to the emergency 
department with intense back pain and fevers. Laboratory data were remarkable 
for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (118) and C-reactive protein (38). 
Initial imaging studies, including a lumbar MRI, did not demonstrate any 
abnormalities. The patient continued to spike fevers, and a repeat lumbar MRI 1 
week later clearly demonstrated the presence of an epidural abscess at the level 
of the PLIF surgery. The patient was treated with surgical debridement and 
epidural abscess drainage. The interbody cage was left in place. Surgical 
cultures identified Staphylococcus aureus as the pathogen, and the patient was 
placed on intravenous vancomycin. During the ensuing 3 weeks, his clinical 
symptoms worsened and his radiographs demonstrated lucency in the region of his 
interbody cage. Repeat debridement was performed, and his interbody cage and 
pedicle screw instrumentation were removed 4 months after initial surgery.
RESULTS: The disc space infection resolved following removal of the implants. 
Radiographs at 6 months after instrumentation removal demonstrated solid 
bilateral posterolateral arthrodesis. The patient returned to active duty 1 year 
after his initial surgery, reporting that his back pain was reduced compared 
with his preoperative level.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of literature on epidural abscess and discitis 
as complications associated with PLIF. In this case, the infection persisted 
despite surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics. The patient ultimately 
required removal of the interbody implant and posterior instrumentation. The 
patient developed solid posterolateral arthrodesis despite the presence of deep 
infection, which led to early implant removal 4 months after the initial 
surgery. This case underscores the potential importance of concomitant 
posterolateral fusion, particularly following wide laminectomy and facetectomy 
required for PLIF.

Does osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine cause chronic low back pain?

The lumbar spine is a common location for osteoarthritis. The axial skeleton 
demonstrates the same classic alterations of cartilage loss, joint instability, 
and osteophytosis characteristic of symptomatic disease in the appendages. 
Despite these similarities, questions remain regarding the lumbar spine facet 
joints as a source of chronic back pain. The facet joints undergo a progression 
of degeneration that may result in pain. The facet joints have sensory input 
from two spinal levels that makes localization of pain difficult. Radiographic 
studies describe intervertebral disc abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals 
that are associated with, but not synonymous for, osteoarthritis. Patients who 
do not have osteoarthritis of the facet joints on magnetic resonance scan do not 
have back pain. Single photon emission computed tomography scans of the axial 
skeleton are able to identify painful facet joints with increased activity that 
may be helped by local anesthetic injections. Low back pain is responsive to 
therapies that are effective for osteoarthritis in other locations. 
Osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine does cause low back pain.

A history of unexplained low back pain associated with chronic constipation in 
an adolescent girl of menarchal age or in an obviously postmenarchal girl should 
make one consider an imperforate hymen with hematocolpos. This is a particular 
important differential diagnosis in the work-up of an adolescent who denies ever 
having had menses or sexual activity. The case of a girl with an imperforate 
hymen presenting with a six-month history of chronic constipation and 
intermittent low back pain is described.

Supernumerary ribs in developmental toxicity bioassays and in human populations: 
incidence and biological significance.

Supernumerary or accessory ribs (SNR), either lumbar (LR) or cervical (CR), are 
a common finding in standard developmental toxicology bioassays. The biological 
significance of these anomalies within the regulatory arena has been problematic 
and the subject of some debate. In rodents, the spontaneous incidence of SNR is 
species and strain related and ranges from <1% to >30%. Compound-induced LR are 
induced by a wide variety of chemical and physical agents when pregnant animals 
are exposed during specific gestational periods. A significant portion of the 
agent-induced LR may be due to maternal factors, as it has been shown that 
stress alone will induce LR in rodents. SNR are not isolated phenomena and 
signify basic alterations in the architecture of the axial skeleton. LR are 
associated with longer ribs, increased numbers of vertebrosternal ribs, and the 
presence of extra presacral vertebrae ("anteriorization"). CR are associated 
with reduced numbers of vertebrosternal ribs (posteriorization). It is evident 
that SNR are not a single anomaly, but consist of two unrelated structures: an 
extra rib that has a cartilaginous segment at the distal end, and an 
ossification site that lacks cartilage. These have a bimodal size distribution, 
with the population of extra ribs being significantly longer than the 
ossification sites, and 0.6 mm can be used as an approximate length for 
distinguishing the two populations in mice. Extra ribs are permanent structures 
in contrast to ossification sites that disappear postnatally, probably becoming 
part of the lateral transverse vertebral processes. SNR are also found in humans 
although, in contrast to laboratory species, CR are more commonly noted. SNR are 
associated with adverse heath effects, and CR with inducing thoracic outlet 
disease characterized by diminished blood flow and altered position of the 
ganglia and nerve roots in the area of the C7-T1 vertebrae. LR are associated 
with lower back pain and L4-5 degeneration. The incidence of CR is greatly 
reduced in adult humans as compared to fetuses, and it has been hypothesized 
that fetal "SNR" may be largely composed of ossification sites that disappear 
postnatally. The mechanisms involved in the formation of extra ribs are not 
understood at this time, although the fact that the early sensitive periods for 
their initiation during embryogenesis is coupled with the associated changes in 
the axial skeleton argues for their induction being due to fundamental changes 
in gene expression. The sum of the experimental evidence supports the idea of 
SNR being composed of two different structures: extra ribs that are permanent 
dysmorphological structures that may be induced by xenobiotics and/or maternal 
stress, and ossification sites that may be transient variations in the formation 
of the lateral processes of the vertebrae.

Evaluation and treatment of low back pain in family practice.

Comment in
    J Am Board Fam Pract. 2005 Mar-Apr;18(2):151-2; author reply 152.

Almost all working adults, more than half in any given year, experience low back 
pain. Although the differential diagnosis is extensive, most symptoms have 
biomechanical causes and resolve promptly with little intervention, although 
recurrence is common. History and physical examination are important in 
distinguishing potential causes and identifying "red flags" for more serious 
conditions. Diagnostic imaging should be ordered only when necessary because of 
the high incidence of radiologic abnormalities in asymptomatic persons. Once 
serious illness is ruled unlikely, first-line drug therapy with acetaminophen, a 
cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is 
recommended. Short-term use of muscle relaxants may be considered, but they can 
be sedating. Patients should stay as active as possible. Comorbid conditions 
such as sleep disorders, anxiety, or depression should be treated, and 
psychosocial issues should be addressed. Opioids should be prescribed if other 
treatments have been insufficiently effective and if there is evidence of 
improved function with opioid treatment that outweighs adverse effects. Adjuvant 
antidepressants and anticonvulsants should be considered, especially in chronic 
or neuropathic pain. If a structural defect is identified and a diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure is available, consider referral. If symptoms have not 
improved within 4 to 6 weeks, re-evaluation and additional diagnostic workup 
should be considered.

Epidural venous plexus enlargements presenting with radiculopathy and back pain 
in patients with inferior vena cava obstruction or occlusion.

Paksoy Y(1), Gormus N.

Author information:
(1)Ultra Görüntüleme Merkezi, Konya, Turkey. yahyapaksoy@yahoo.com

STUDY DESIGN: In the last 2 years, we have examined 9640 patients experiencing 
back pain or sciatica, using MRI. There were 13 (0.13%) patients who had 
radicular symptoms that clinically mimicked lumbar disc herniation or spinal 
stenosis. All of these patients had inferior vena caval obstruction or occlusion 
that caused engorgement in the epidural and paravertebral venous system, causing 
nerve root compression.
OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the imaging characteristics of 13 patients with 
epidural engorged veins due to inferior vena cava obstruction or occlusion 
causing sciatica and low back pain.
SUMMARY OF THE BACKGROUND DATA: Abnormalities or pathological changes of 
epidural venous network may give rise to symptoms similar to or mimicking lumbar 
disc herniation or spinal stenosis. Multiple lumbar epidural varices can cause 
nerve root and thecal sac compression. Lumbar epidural varices have been 
infrequently described in the literature. To date, the cause of anterior 
epidural venous enlargement has been poorly understood, and both congenital and 
acquired causes have been proposed. This report describes enlarged epidural 
veins in patients with inferior vena caval thrombosis or obstruction presenting 
with radicular syndromes.
METHODS: The authors have seen 13 patients with radicular symptoms. All of the 
patients had inferior vena caval obstruction or occlusion that caused 
engorgement in the epidural veins, causing nerve root compression. The ages of 
these patients ranged from 20 to 53 (mean, 30) years. All of the patients were 
examined with color Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance scanner.
RESULTS: Ten of 13 patients had inferior vena cava thrombosis located just under 
the renal vein orifices. In two patients, there was compression to inferior vena 
cava due to parity. In the remaining patient, a huge intra-abdominal mass was 
observed, and this mass was causing inferior vena cava obstruction and invasion. 
Enlargements of epidural venous plexus were demonstrated in all of these cases. 
All of the patients presented with the acute onset of low back pain followed 
shortly thereafter by acute radicular symptoms. The compression to inferior vena 
cava could not be treated in one patient because of intra-abdominal malignancy. 
The remaining 12 patients with inferior vena cava obstruction or occlusion 
experienced complete resolution of symptoms after treatment or delivery.
CONCLUSION: The authors believe that epidural venous engorgement should be 
considered when the symptoms of patients with deep venous and inferior vena cava 
thrombosis are accompanied by radicular and/or back pain, because pathologic 
processes compressing a nerve root can cause pain.

Young athletes with low back pain: skeletal scintigraphy of conditions other 
than pars interarticularis stress.

PURPOSE: Skeletal scintigraphy is an important method for showing evidence of 
stress injuries affecting the partes interarticulares of young athletes with low 
back pain. Other etiologies of low back pain may also cause uptake abnormalities 
in these patients. How often do the results of skeletal scintigraphy support 
diagnoses other than stress injuries to the partes interarticulares and what are 
these diagnoses?
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 209 young 
patients (149 females, 60 males; age range: 8-21 years, mean: 15.7 years) with 
low back pain and no previously treated vertebral condition who were 
consecutively referred from a sports medicine clinic to skeletal scintigraphy.
RESULTS: Sites of high uptake supportive of diagnoses other than pars 
interarticularis stress were shown in 36 (17%) of the 209 patients. Other 
diagnoses supported by skeletal scintigraphy included stress at the articulation 
between a transitional vertebra and the sacrum, injuries to the vertebral body 
ring apophysis, sacral fracture, spinous process injury, and sacroiliac joint 
stress.
CONCLUSION: Skeletal scintigraphy shows uptake abnormalities supportive of 
diagnoses other than pars interarticularis stress in a significant number of 
young patients with low back pain. The uptake abnormalities shown are usually 
stress-related in this select population.

The effect of previous low back surgery on general health status: results from 
the National Spine Network initial visit survey of patients with low back pain.

Hee HT(1), Whitecloud TS 3rd, Myers L.

Author information:
(1)Tulane University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA. hwantak@hotmail.com

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study on 18,325 patients with back pain enrolled 
at first visit in the National Spine Network (NSN) database from January 1998 to 
April 2000.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether patients who had previous low back surgeries had 
poorer general health status than patients with no surgery.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several studies have described the role of 
psychological abnormalities in patients with chronic low back pain. Some of 
these patients have had previous spinal surgeries performed. No study has 
examined the effects of previous low back surgery on the general health status.
METHODS: The Short Form Health Survey 36 was administered to the initial visit 
NSN patients. Of the 18,325 patients enrolled, 3,632 had previous low back 
surgeries.
RESULTS: Patients who had previous lumbar surgeries fared significantly poorly 
in all 10 scores of the SF-36 health survey, even after adjustment for 
confounding factors. Among these patients, decompression achieved significantly 
higher scores for General Health, Role-Physical, and Mental Component Summary 
scales. Patients who had decompression as their most recent surgery had higher 
scores for General Health, Role-Physical, Role-Emotional, and Mental Component 
Summary scales, when compared to those who had other surgeries. Patients who had 
instrumentation as their most recent surgery had higher scores for Bodily Pain 
and Physical Component Summary scores. There is a positive correlation between 
time since last surgery and the SF-36 outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous back surgery is associated with significantly worse 
general health status than those without surgery. Among patients who had 
previous surgeries, decompression seems to exert better effects on SF-36 health 
status. There is a positive correlation between time since last surgery and the 
SF-36 outcomes, although the SF-36 scores are significantly lower than those 
without previous surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are often incidental findings in 
patients undergoing US, CT or MRI studies. The recommended field of view (FOV) 
for standard CT examinations of the spine is 14 cm. This FOV does not allow full 
visualization of the abdominal aorta.
PURPOSE: To justify a larger FOV for male smokers older than 55 years and women 
older than 65 years, with a higher incidence of AAA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lumbar CT examinations of 100 consecutive patients 
(age: mean 68 years, range 55-85 years) presented with low-back pain were 
retrospectively reviewed. Measurements of the abdominal aorta and lumbar 
abnormalities were analysed. A control study in 850 patients who underwent 
abdominal CT scans for other causes was available for comparison.
RESULTS: There were three men with AAAs measuring 4.5, 5.5 and 5.6 cm (mean 5.2 
cm). Findings related to the clinical problem were disk prolapse or herniation, 
spondylosis, spinal stenosis and grade I spondylolesthesis. In the control 
group, 17 patients were found with AAAs with diameter greater than 4 cm (2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low-back pain, older than 55 years of age, examined 
with lumbar spine CT, should also be screened for aortic disease, since the 
prevalence of AAA is similar with that of an age-matched control group. 
Appropriate modification in the applied FOV is recommended.

Expanding occult intrasacral meningocele associated with diastematomyelia and 
multiple vertebral anomalies. Case report.

Comment in
    J Neurosurg. 2005 Aug;103(2 Suppl):204-5; author reply 205.

The authors report the case of a 7-year-old girl who presented with persistent 
low-back and left leg pain and was diagnosed with expanding occult intrasacral 
meningocele (OIM), diastematomyelia, tethered cord, and multiple vertebral 
anomalies. She was followed for 27 months. Removal of a bone spur and sectioning 
of the tight terminal filum did not relieve her left leg and back pain. Serial 
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after initial detection of the OIM revealed 
gradual but significant enlargement of the lesion. Fifteen months after terminal 
filum release and bone spur resection, the OIM was excised. After this surgery, 
the back and leg pain resolved. No case of OIM reported to date contains 
documented serial MR imaging confirmation of enlargement of OIM. Furthermore, 
this is the first report of OIM associated with diastematomyelia. Because most 
OIMs expand, the authors recommend that, in addition to surgery for associated 
congenital anomalies, the OIM be totally excised to resolve symptoms completely.

The imaging findings in some cases of low back pain are difficult to describe 
and the pathophysiology is not clear because subjective findings are usually 
difficult to document. This report concerns a rare case about the lumbosacral 
joint causing persistent severe back pain which in itself does not usually have 
any pathological meaning. We describe the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of a 
patient suffering from low back pain with lumbosacral transitional vertebra. The 
radiological examination showed the congenitally malformed transverse processes 
of the 5th lumbar vertebra to create a facet joint-like shape at the sacral ala 
region on both sides. Surgery resulted in immediate disappearance of the low 
back pain. When the lumbosacral junction shows some instability without fusion, 
the joint-like region could be the cause of low back pain. The lumbosacral 
transitional vertebra may be associated with low back pain. Electric denervation 
of the space between the transverse process of 5th lumbar vertebra and sacral 
ala is minimally invasive and effective for pain eradication.

INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: Low back pain (LBP) is a frequent injury in athletes. This 
study examined the relationship between isokinetic trunk muscle strength and the 
functional disability level of chronic LBP. We particularly focused on the 
existence of radiological abnormalities (RA) in the lumbar region.
METHODS: Subjects were 53 collegiate wrestlers. Trunk extensor and flexor muscle 
strength was measured at three angular velocities (60, 90, and 120degrees x 
s(-1)). The examined parameters for trunk muscle strength were peak torque, 
work, average torque, and average power. The disability level of LBP was 
estimated by using two questionnaires. Based on the RA evaluation with x-ray and 
MRI, all 53 wrestlers were assigned to two groups as the RA group (N = 35, 66%) 
and the non-RA group (N = 18, 34%). Correlations between trunk muscle strength 
and the disability level of LBP in each group were analyzed with Spearman's rank 
test.
RESULTS: Without considering the disability level, there were 14 subjects with 
LBP (40%) in the RA group and 8 (44%) in the non-RA. Significantly correlated 
parameters with the disability level of LBP could be observed only when the 
subjects were restricted to the non-RA group. The correlated parameters with the 
two questionnaires were peak torque at 120degrees x s(-1), work at 60degrees x 
s(-1) and 90degrees x s(-1), and average torque at 90degrees x s(-1) and 
120degrees x s(-1). There were no significantly correlated parameters in the RA 
group. None of the trunk flexor parameters were significantly correlated with 
the disability level of LBP.
CONCLUSION: The relatively low strength of trunk extensors may be one of the 
factors related to nonspecific chronic low back pain in collegiate wrestlers.

IgD myeloma, which is particularly severe, accounts for only 1-3% of all myeloma 
cases, and the kappa subtype contributes only 10-30% of IgD myelomas. We report 
a new case.
CASE-REPORT: A 59-year-old man was admitted for inflammatory low back pain with 
L5 sciatica and diffuse bone pain. The symptoms had been present for 3 months, 
during which he had experienced a severe decline in general health. Laboratory 
test abnormalities included an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 70 mm/h, 
normochromic normocytic aplastic anemia, hypercalcemia (3.5 mmol/l), and serum 
creatinine elevation to 583 micromol/l. Tests were negative for 
cryoglobulinemia. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypergammaglobulinemia 
but no monoclonal peak. Immunoelectrophoresis, however, detected a faint IgD 
kappa band in the blood and a homogeneous kappa band in the urine. Bone marrow 
aspirated from the sternum was found to contain 30% of malignant plasma cells. 
Biopsies for amyloidosis were negative. Radiographs disclosed multiple 
punched-out lesions with no evidence of spinal cord compression. Symptomatic 
treatment was given to correct the hypercalcemia, and combination chemotherapy 
was started.
DISCUSSION: IgD kappa myeloma is a severe variant of myeloma often associated 
with extraosseous lesions, renal failure, and amyloidosis. The monoclonal 
component is absent or faint by serum protein electrophoresis, making the 
diagnosis difficult. The pathogenesis is unclear and the prognosis grim.

    Cephalalgia. 2005 Jul;25(7):558; author reply 558.

PURPOSE: To investigate clinical, MRI, and radioisotope findings and therapeutic 
outcome of the syndrome of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH).
BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is characterized by orthostatic 
headache, low CSF pressure, and MRI findings of diffuse pachymeningeal 
gadolinium enhancement without previous history of head trauma or lumbar 
puncture. Spontaneous CSF leakage from a spinal dural tear has been suggested as 
the underlying pathogenic mechanism of SIH. Most patients recover without 
sequelae, but subdural collections have been described in a few.
METHODS: Twelve consecutive patients (10 females, 2 males, mean age 39 years) 
with headache related to the syndrome of spontaneous intracranial hypotension 
were investigated.
RESULTS: Eleven patients presented orthostatic headache, one patient had 
continuous nonpostural headache. Additional clinical symptoms included nausea, 
vomiting, tinnitus, diplopia, and back pain. All the patients had low CSF 
opening pressure, seven had increased CSF albumin, and four had pleocytosis. 
Brain MRI showed diffuse pachymeningeal gadolinium enhancement. Other features 
included subdural fluid collections (hematoma/hygroma) in four patients, 
downward displacement of the brain in four patients, and enlargement of the 
pituitary gland in one patient. Radioisotope cisternography results indicated, 
in two patients, a CSF leakage site in the cervico-thoracic region, and in one 
patient showed limited ascent of the tracer to the cerebral convexity and early 
appearance of radioisotope in the bladder. All the patients had complete 
resolution of headache with conservative treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SIH have distinct MRI and sometimes radioisotope 
cisternographic abnormalities and generally respond favorably to conservative 
management.

Spine duplication, which is at the severe end of the split cord malformation, is 
rarely seen. Radiographic, CT, and MR images of a 15-year-old girl who had lower 
back pain showed asymmetric lumbar spine duplication with spinal cord tethering 
secondary to a filum lipoma in the sacrum. Despite gross spinal abnormalities, 
the patient was neurologically intact and has been followed up with conservative 
treatment.

    Ann Rheum Dis. 2006 Sep;65(9):1251-2.

BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (LBP), the leading symptom of ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) and undifferentiated axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), precedes 
the development of radiographic sacroiliitis, sometimes by many years.
OBJECTIVE: To assign disease probabilities and to develop an algorithm to help 
in the early diagnosis of axial SpA.
METHODS: Axial SpA comprises AS and undifferentiated SpA with predominant axial 
involvement. Clinical features include inflammatory back pain (IBP), alternating 
buttock pain, enthesitis, arthritis, dactylitis, acute anterior uveitis, a 
positive family history, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and good 
response to NSAIDs. Associated laboratory findings include raised acute phase 
reactions, HLA-B27 association, and abnormalities on skeletal imaging. 
Sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of these parameters 
were determined from published studies. A 5% prevalence of axial SpA among 
patients with chronic LBP was used. The probability of the presence of axial 
SpA, depending on the presence or absence of the above clinical features of SpA, 
was determined. A probability of > or = 90% was used to make a diagnosis of 
axial SpA.
RESULTS: The presence of inflammatory back pain features increased the 
probability of axial SpA from the background 5% prevalence to 14%. The presence 
of 2-3 SpA features was necessary to increase the probability of axial SpA to 
90%. The highest LRs were obtained for HLA-B27 and MRI. Diagnostic algorithms to 
be used in daily practice were suggested.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach can help clinicians to diagnose with a high degree of 
confidence axial SpA at an early stage in patients with IBP who lack 
radiographic sacroiliitis.

[Henoch-Schonlein purpura and renal tuberculosis].

INTRODUCTION: Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel leucocytoclastic 
vasculitis with IGA deposit. Its little known underlying pathogenic mechanism 
probably involves an auto-immune reaction triggered-off by various antigens and 
notably bacterial or viral infectious agents.
OBSERVATION: An HSP associated with renal tuberculosis was observed in a 12 
year-old girl. Renal tuberculosis, suspected because of lumbago with aseptic 
leukocyturia, was confirmed by the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the 
urine and the abnormalities found in intravenous urography. One month after 
initiation of the antituberculosis treatment, an HSP was confirmed by cutaneous 
biopsy. Evolution was rapidly favourable. Eight years later, the patient had not 
presented any other episodes of HSP or renal involvement.
DISCUSSION: The association of a tuberculosis with HSP is very rarely reported 
in children. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms are not yet clear. It can be 
triggered-off by tuberculosis or antituberculosis treatment. In our patient, the 
rapid regression of the symptomatology and pursuit of the treatment without 
incidents argue against the hypothesis of HSP induced by antituberculosis 
agents.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the temporal evolution of type-1 
end-plate changes on MRI in patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar 
spine and to evaluate whether any correlation exists between such evolution and 
the change in patients' symptoms. Forty-four patients with 48 Modic type-1 
end-plate changes (low TI signal and high T2 signal) were studied. All patients 
had an initial and a follow-up non-contrast lumbar MRI with variable intervals 
between the studies (12-72 months). Severity of the end-plate changes was 
assessed by eyeball estimation. Correlation with patients' symptoms was studied 
with the help of the Visual Analogue Score (VAS), Oswestry Questionnaire Score 
(OQS) and patients' subjective assessment. Of the 48 disc levels with type-1 
changes, 18 (37.5%) converted fully to type 2 (high T1 signal and intermediate 
to high T2 signal), 7 (14.6%) partially converted to type 2, 19 (39.6%) became 
worse (i.e. type 1 changes became more extensive) and 4 (8.3%) showed no change. 
Higher average VAS (5.7) and OQS (42.3) scores were noted in patients where 
there was worsening type-1 change and lower scores (3.8 and 27, respectively) 
were seen in those where there was conversion to type-2 change. These trends, 
however, did not reach statistical significance (P values 0.16 and 0.09 for VAS 
and OQS, respectively). The statistical relationship was stronger after 
exclusion of patients with confounding factors (i.e. changes in lumbar MRI other 
than end-plate changes that could independently explain the evolution of 
patients' symptoms) with P-values of 0.08 and 0.07 for VAS and OQS, 
respectively. Type-1 end-plate change represents a dynamic process and in a 
large majority of cases either converts to type-2 change or becomes more 
extensive. The evolution of type-1 change relates to change in patient's 
symptoms, but not to a statistically significant level.

Relationship between radiographic abnormalities of lumbar spine and incidence of 
low back pain in high school and college football players: a prospective study.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common presenting symptom among players of 
American football. In Japan, however, skeletal disorders in football players, 
including low back problems, have been rarely studied, and management to prevent 
skeletal disorders has not been established.
STUDY DESIGN: An epidemiological study with prospective observation.
METHODS: The authors analyzed the relationship between lumbar spine 
abnormalities viewed through radiographs taken during the preparticipation 
physical examination, and the incidence of low back pain during a 1-year period 
in 171 high school and 742 college football players. Abnormalities assessed were 
spondylolysis, disc space narrowing, spinal instability, Schmorl's node, balloon 
disc, and spina bifida occulta.
RESULTS: High school players with spondylolysis had a higher incidence of low 
back pain (79.8%) than those with no abnormal radiographic results (37.1%). 
College players with spondylolysis, disc space narrowing, and spinal instability 
had a higher incidence of low back pain (80.5%, 59.8%, and 53.5%, respectively) 
than those with no abnormal radiographs (32.1%), and college players with 
spondylolysis had a higher incidence of low back pain than those with disc space 
narrowing and spinal instability.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that an abnormality such 
as spondylolysis is the most significant risk factor for low back pain in high 
school and college football players, and that disc space narrowing and spinal 
instability are also significant risk factors for low back pain in athletes with 
greater athletic activity such as college football players.

A 78-year-old woman presented for evaluation of back pain, urinary dysfunction, 
leg weakness and progressive equinovarus foot deformity. She reported that 
shortly after her birth in 1924, she underwent resection of a subcutaneous 
'cyst' in the lower lumbar area. Seven years prior to evaluation at our 
institution, she had undergone bilateral total knee arthroplasty for 
osteoarthritis. After the procedure, she began to experience severe low back 
pain that radiated into her legs. Weakness of the foot inverters, urinary 
dysfunction and worsening bilateral equinovarus foot deformity developed in the 
years following the surgery. MRI revealed a split cord malformation with a 
tethered spinal cord. Because of the patient's age and poor medical condition, 
her symptoms were managed conservatively. This case demonstrates symptomatic 
deterioration in an elderly patient with a tethered spinal cord after many years 
of clinical stability.

Pain-related fear, lumbar flexion, and dynamic EMG among persons with chronic 
musculoskeletal low back pain.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between 
pain-related fear, lumbar flexion, and dynamic EMG activity among persons with 
chronic musculoskeletal low back pain. It was hypothesized that pain-related 
fear would be significantly related to decreased lumbar flexion and specific 
patterns of EMG activity during flexion and extension.
STUDY DESIGN: Data was obtained from subjects who, on a single day, completed 
self-report measures of pain and pain-related fear, and were interviewed to 
determine demographic and pain information. Subjects then underwent a dynamic 
EMG evaluation for which they were asked to stand, then bend forward as far as 
possible, stay fully flexed, and return to standing. Lumbar EMG and angle of 
flexion were recorded during this time. A flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR) was 
computed by comparing maximal EMG while flexing to the average EMG in full 
flexion.
SUBJECTS: Seventy-six persons with chronic musculoskeletal low back pain.
RESULTS: Zero-order correlations indicated that pain-related fear was 
significantly related to reduced lumber flexion (r = -0.55), maximum EMG during 
flexion (r = -0.38) and extension (r = -0.51), and the FRR (r = -0.40). When 
controlling for pain and demographic factors, pain-related fear continued to be 
related to reduced lumbar flexion. Using a path-analytic model to examine 
whether angle of flexion mediated the relationship between fear and EMG 
activity, the models examining maximal EMG during flexion and extension 
supported the notion that pain-related fear influences these measures indirectly 
through its association with decreased range of motion. Conversely, pain-related 
fear was independently related to higher average EMG in full flexion, while 
angle of flexion was not significantly related. Pain-related fear was directly 
related to a smaller FRR, as well as indirectly through angle of flexion.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain-related fear is significantly associated with reduced lumbar 
flexion, greater EMG in full flexion, and a smaller FRR. The relationship 
between pain-related fear and EMG during flexion and extension appears to be 
mediated by reduced lumbar flexion. These results suggest that pain-related fear 
is directly associated with musculoskeletal abnormalities observed among persons 
with chronic low back pain, as well as indirectly through limited lumbar 
flexion. These musculoskeletal abnormalities as well as limited movement may be 
involved in the development and maintenance of chronic low back pain. In 
addition, changes in musculoskeletal functioning and flexion associated with 
pain-related fear may warrant greater attention as part of treatment.

komagatam@mail.goo.ne.jp

OBJECTIVE: Tight filum terminale (TFT) is not an uncommon condition, but due to 
insufficient diagnostic options this syndrome is often overlooked and left 
untreated. The present study was designed to investigate surgical results 
concerning neurological perspectives and diagnostic methods for TFT.
METHODS: Subjects for this study consisted of 37 patients with TFT who were 
surgically treated by transecting the filum terminale. We examined the surgical 
outcomes with regard to low back pain, leg pain, and bladder and bowel 
dysfunctions, and analyzed neurological and imaging findings.
RESULTS: TFT diagnosis was based on the following five criteria; 1) low back 
pain, 2) non-dermatomal leg pain, 3) bladder-bowel dysfunction, 4) spinal 
stiffness, and 5) a newly developed positive provocation test for spinal cord 
extension.
CONCLUSION: The survey of surgical outcomes indicated that satisfactory results 
could be obtained by surgical release of the filum terminale, while neural 
function was still reversible. In particular, our newly devised provocation test 
was shown to be highly effective for the early diagnosis of this disorder.

The authors report a case of fibro-epithelial polyp in a young woman with Turner 
syndrome with features of a right ureteropelvic junction syndrome in a horseshoe 
kidney. The patient presented a history of chronic low back pain associated with 
macroscopic haematuria leading to various complementary investigations including 
ureteroscopy. The endoscopic appearance of the tumour suggested the diagnosis 
despite the presence of atypical renal pelvis cytology. Pyeloplasty and proximal 
ureterectomy allowed confirmation and treatment of this rare lesion.

The clinical and radiological incidence of lumbosacral (LS) disease was studied 
on 57 German Shepherd dogs (GSDs) used in active service. The study included a 
clinical history, a neurological examination, and plain radiographs of the 
caudal lumbar vertebrae. The neurological examinations revealed lower back pain 
and/or neural deficits in 21 dogs, of which 14 had a history of pain or pelvic 
gait abnormalities. Radiographic findings were spondylosis at L7-S1, 
degeneration of L7-S1 disc, LS malalignment, transitional LS vertebrae and/or 
primary spinal canal stenosis in 15 dogs with neurological abnormalities and/or 
back pain and in 18 dogs with no clinical signs. No correlation between the 
neurological and the radiographic findings were found. This study demonstrates 
that even prominent radiographic LS abnormalities are of minimal value in the 
evaluation of LS disease in the GSD.

The value of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of fatty filum 
terminale.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, 
NC 27710, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
characteristics of fatty fila that are correlated with neurological deficits, 
especially in the presence of a normal-level conus medullaris.
METHODS: Lumbosacral MRI scans were reviewed for patients with fatty fila who 
were treated at Duke University Medical Center during a 5-year period. The 
patients were divided into three groups. Group I patients (n = 5) had fatty fila 
that were incidentally detected during evaluations for metastases or infections. 
Group II patients (n = 16) exhibited isolated low back pain but were in 
neurologically intact condition. Group III patients (n = 15) exhibited 
neurological impairments consistent with distal spinal cord dysfunction. Several 
characteristics were measured on the MRI scans, including the location of the 
conus medullaris, the filum thickness, and the distance of fat from the conus. 
These results were assessed for statistically significant correlation with the 
presence of clinical symptoms.
RESULTS: The majority of patients in all three groups demonstrated the normal 
conus position (L2 or above) and thickened fila. The distance of fat from the 
conus was the only parameter that demonstrated a statistically significant 
difference among the groups.
CONCLUSION: The following findings were noted: 1) patients were likely to 
exhibit neurological deficits at a younger age (<22 yr in Group III versus 47 yr 
in Groups I and II); 2) a conus level below L2 was associated with neurological 
deficits (Group III); 3) filum thickness was not correlated with clinical 
presentation; 4) fat in the filum within 13 mm of the conus medullaris was most 
predictive of neurological deficits (Group III).

Surgical outcomes for tethered spinal cord syndrome (TCS) associated with 
low-lying conus medullaris were evaluated. We investigated the long-term results 
of untethering the spinal cord and dural plasty in surgical patients with a wide 
age range. Improvement of bladder dysfunction and suppression of leg deformity 
progression were noted in two pediatric patients. However, severe urinary 
dysfunction generally remained postoperatively. Adult patients commonly showed 
low back or leg pain as clinical manifestations. In seven adult patients, 
urinary dysfunction also improved. Neurologic findings and urinary deficits 
showed a favorable improvement mostly in adult TCS in comparison with natal or 
juvenile onset of TCS. A short duration from onset to surgery and cranial 
movement of the conus medullaris as assessed by postoperative magnetic resonance 
imaging were factors indicating a favorable prognosis.

The lumbar spine is a common location for osteoarthritis. The axial skeleton 
demonstrates the same classic alterations of cartilage loss, joint instability, 
and osteophytosis characteristic of symptomatic disease in the appendages. 
Despite these similarities, questions remain regarding the lumbar spine facet 
joints as a source of chronic back pain. The facet joints undergo a progression 
of degeneration that may result in pain. The facet joints have sensory input 
from two spinal levels that makes localization of pain difficult. Radiographic 
studies describe intervertebral disc abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals 
that are associated with, but not synonymous for, osteoarthritis. Patients who 
do not have osteoarthritis of the facet joints on magnetic resonance scan do not 
have back pain. Single photon emission computed tomography scans of the axial 
skeleton are able to identify painful facet joints with increased activity that 
may be helped by local anesthetic injections. Low back pain is responsive to 
therapies that are effective for osteoarthritis in other locations. 
Osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine does cause low back pain.

OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in chronic and acute magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) abnormalities of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) in early spondylarthropathy 
(SpA), and to associate these findings with computed tomography (CT), X-ray, and 
clinical findings during a 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients, 20 males and 14 females, median age 27 years, 
with inflammatory low back pain (median 23 months) were included. MRI, CT, and 
X-ray, as well as clinical and laboratory tests were performed. After a 
follow-up period of 1 year (median 377 days) the examinations were repeated, and 
the findings were correlated.
RESULTS: MRI and CT changes resulting from SIJ destruction increased 
significantly during follow-up, and the two modalities were significantly 
correlated. For the MRI findings of inflammatory activity, only bone marrow 
oedema decreased significantly. An increase in the Schober test was the only 
clinical examination that changed significantly.
CONCLUSION: In early SpA, MRI can detect significant inflammatory and 
destructive changes of the SIJs over a 1-year follow-up period, in spite of 
minimal changes in the clinical parameters. The MRI changes in inflammatory 
activity are not detectable by CT and X-ray examinations. Thus, MRI may be a 
sensitive method, without known risks, for early diagnosis and for following 
disease progression in SpA.

Lumbosacral transitional vertebral articulation: evaluation by planar and SPECT 
bone scintigraphy.

It has been suggested that low back pain (LBP) may arise from lumbosacral 
transitional vertebral articulation (LSTVA) itself. It is known that bone 
scintigraphy is a valuable tool for the recognition of pain arising from bone 
and articular diseases. Therefore we aimed to show planar and SPECT bone 
scintigraphic findings of LSTVA and compare them with the LBP and X-ray 
findings. Twenty-eight patients (aged 20-63 years) in whom LSTVA had been 
identified radiographically were evaluated with planar bone scintigraphy, 
utilizing 99mTc methylene diphosphonate; and single photon emission computed 
tomography (SPECT) bone scintigraphy. Eighteen patients had LBP whereas 10 had 
not. There were 25 type IIA, one type IIB and two type IIIA LSTV articulation. 
On planar images, normal or non-focal minimally increased uptake superimposed on 
the upper sacroiliac joint was seen in patients without degenerative changes 
regardless of LBP whereas SPECT showed non-focal mild increased uptake on the 
area medial to the upper sacroiliac joint. Planar scans showed normal to 
non-focal mild, and mild-to-moderately increased uptake whereas SPECT 
demonstrated focal mild-to-moderately and markedly increased uptake in patients 
with degenerative changes without LBP and with LBP, respectively. The X-ray 
results showed an association of LBP degenerative changes, and the SPECT results 
showed a focal, markedly increased, uptake. We conclude that this focal, 
markedly increased, uptake may show the metabolically active degenerative 
changes of LSTV articulation and may help to reveal the pain arising from LSTVA. 
Therefore we propose that bone scintigraphy may be considered for the evaluation 
of patients with LBP thought to arise from LSTV articulation.

A 68-year-old patient suffered for 8 years from radicular S1 pain on the left 
side, which was aggravated by walking. After an increased effort, he experienced 
a violent dorsal pain and sensitive troubles in the left T1 and T2 territories. 
Low back pain and painful paresthesiae of right leg came on next. Physical 
examination revealed proprioceptive symptoms on the left, a left pyramidal 
syndrome and a sacral pilonidal sinus. MRI showed on level of L2 vertebra, a 
spinal cord duplication in a unique dural tube, corresponding to diplomyelia or 
split cord malformation (SCM) type II. The patient had low conus medullaris 
anchored on L3-L4 level. A syringomyelia surmounted this medullar dysraphia. 
Split cord malformations, SCM type I (diplomyelia) or SCM type II 
(diastematomyelia), are usually revealed in infancy or early childhood. They are 
very rarely discovered late in the life. With progress in noninvasive spinal 
cord imaging, such diagnoses will undoubtedly be made more often in adults.

Lumbar discography: an update.

Anderson MW(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, University of Virginia, PO Box 800170, 
Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.

Discogenic pain most commonly affects the low back, buttocks, and hips and is 
thought to be a byproduct of internal disk degeneration. It is postulated that 
progressive annular breakdown and tearing results in biomechanical and/or 
biochemical stimulation of the pain fibers that reside in the outer one third of 
the annulus. Although multiple imaging modalities, most notably MRI, can show 
morphologic abnormalities of the spine, discography remains the only test that 
provides physiologic information regarding what role a given intervertebral disk 
plays in a patient's symptom complex. The controversy surrounding discography is 
here to stay until more definitive, well-designed studies are performed. In the 
meantime, there are certain things that can help the discographer maximize the 
accuracy of the test: 1. Always try to inject one "normal" disk as a "control 
level." 2. Be alert for factors that are associated with an increased 
false-positive rate (abnormal non-anatomic pain maps, a history of chronic pain 
of spinal or nonspinal origin, abnormal psychometric testing, and prior surgery 
at the injected disk level). In these cases, special attention should be 
directed to both the patient's verbal and nonverbal cues during disk injection. 
3. Do not give any audible clues as to what level is being injected or when the 
injection is starting or finishing. In this regard, we find it very helpful to 
have one of our personnel talk with the patient during this portion of the 
procedure while closely observing the patient for any nonverbal cues regarding 
their pain response. This distraction is preferable to a silent room where the 
patient is intensely focused on what is going on with the injections. We also 
find that music playing during the procedure helps to relax and often distract 
the patient as well. 4. If the results are equivocal at a level (i.e., you are 
unable to determine whether or not the patient's pain response was truly 
concordant), go on to inject another disk level and then come back to reinject 
more contrast into the disk in question. As radiologists, we tend to focus on 
the technical aspects of a procedure and the anatomic/morphologic information it 
provides. However, it cannot be emphasized enough that when performing lumbar 
discography, the assessment of the patient's pain response during the injection 
is the most important component of the procedure, and requires not only 
technical skills, but an understanding of how best to avoid some of the pitfalls 
that can lead to inaccurate results.

Aortic injuries can easily be missed in polytraumatized patients due to either 
associated injuries or vagueness of physical examination findings. Especially in 
young adults without associated injuries, relatively low atherosclerotic changes 
may limit the dissection of traumatic descending aortic injuries. We present a 
34-year-old male patient who only had a complaint of back pain following a 
traffic accident. Upon detection of no abnormalities on plain X-ray films, he 
was discharged home with analgesics. One week later, he presented with dypsnea 
and dysphagia. Aortography showed rupture of the aorta and a pseudoaneurysm near 
the isthmus. Following surgical excision of the pseudoaneurysm and aortic repair 
with a Dacron graft interposition he was discharged with complete relief of 
symptoms. This case emphasizes the need for a high index of clinical suspicion 
in timely diagnosis and prompt treatment of traumatic aortic ruptures.

Evaluation of Chapman's neurolymphatic reflexes via applied kinesiology: a case 
report of low back pain and congenital intestinal abnormality.

Caso ML.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the applied kinesiologic evaluation of Chapman's 
neurolymphatic (NL) reflexes in the management of a person with an unusual 
congenital bowel abnormality and its role in the manifestation of low back pain. 
The theoretical foundations of these reflexes will be elaborated on and 
practical applications discussed.
CLINICAL FEATURES: A 29-year-old man had chronic low back pain. Radiographs of 
the patient's lumbar spine and pelvis were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) demonstrated a mild protrusion of the fifth lumbar disk. Oral 
anti-inflammatory agents, cortisone injections, and chiropractic manipulative 
therapy provided little relief. Though generally in robust health, the patient 
was aware of a congenital intestinal abnormality diagnosed when he was a child; 
it was thought to be of no consequence with regard to his current back 
condition.
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient's history, combined with applied 
kinesiology examination, indicated a need to direct treatment to the large 
bowel. The essential diagnostic indicators were the analysis of the Chapman's 
neurolymphatic reflexes themselves, coupled with an evaluation of the 
traditional acupuncture meridians. The primary prescribed therapy was the 
stimulation of these reflexes by the patient at home. This intervention resulted 
in the resolution of the patient's musculoskeletal symptomatology, as well as 
improved bowel function.
CONCLUSION: The rather remarkable outcome from the application of this 
relatively simple, yet valuable, diagnostic and therapeutic procedure represents 
a thought-provoking impetus for future study and clinical application.

Routine screening for abuse: opening Pandora's box?

Author information:
(1)r.te.kolster@hccnet.nl

OBJECTIVE: To review the case of a patient who had been physically abused by a 
previous partner and to discuss the importance of routine screening for abuse.
CLINICAL FEATURES: A 33-year-old female had neck pain, right shoulder pain, and 
low back pain. During the history taking, she disclosed that she had been in an 
abusive relationship, and her current complaints were thought to be a direct 
result of one of the violent episodes she suffered. Radiographs of her neck and 
shoulder were obtained to rule out a traumatic etiology. In the absence of any 
gross abnormalities, her symptoms were found to be biomechanical in origin.
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Therapy included spinal manipulation and soft tissue 
techniques to the symptomatic areas. During the treatments, much consideration 
was given to the fact that she had been a victim of domestic violence and the 
emotional and physical impact this had on her current situation. Manipulative 
techniques were adapted so that the patient would not perceive them as 
threatening, and a considerable amount of time was spent on counseling. After a 
number of treatments, she reported significant improvement in her overall 
condition.
CONCLUSIONS: For practitioners of spinal manipulative therapy, routine screening 
for abuse is an essential part of history taking. Awareness of a patient's 
experiences with domestic violence is required to make appropriate adjustments 
in the management plan.

Thrombosis of a spinal arteriovenous malformation after hemorrhage: case report.

Chun JY(1), Gulati M, Halbach V, Lawton MT.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California at San 
Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143-0112, USA.

BACKGROUND: Thrombosis of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and spinal 
dural arteriovenous fistulas following hemorrhage rarely have been reported. 
Rarer still is thrombosis of spinal AVMs following hemorrhage.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 6-year-old boy presented with sudden low back and sciatic 
pain, bilateral leg weakness, and an intramedullary spinal cord hematoma. Spinal 
angiography demonstrated dilated feeding arteries without shunting, and no 
intervention was performed. Over time, these enlarged arteries reduced in 
caliber, and the patient recovered fully.
CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of spinal AVMs and AVM thrombosis make their coincidence 
in this case unique. Although surgical intervention would have enabled 
definitive diagnosis of the spinal AVM, it is not mandatory in the absence of 
arteriovenous shunting. What is mandatory, however, is continued angiographic 
surveillance, particularly in pediatric patients.

A prognostic model for the presence of neurogenic lesions in atypical idiopathic 
scoliosis.

Morcuende JA(1), Dolan LA, Vazquez JD, Jirasirakul A, Weinstein SL.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.

STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive series of patients with idiopathic scoliosis with 
atypical features.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to define a specific yet sensitive set 
of signs and symptoms to indicate the use of MRI in patients with atypical 
idiopathic scoliosis. Specifically, this study empirically defines a new 
diagnostic test for the presence of neurogenic lesions based on clinical and 
radiologic data and then reports the properties of this test in relation to MRI 
as the gold standard.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The reported prevalence of brain stem and spinal 
cord abnormalities in patients with idiopathic scoliosis associated with 
atypical features varies from 0% to 60%. This wide range most likely results 
from the fact that the samples studied are either not well defined or are 
heterogeneous across studies. Because of these issues, the likelihood of 
neurogenic lesions in atypical idiopathic scoliosis is not known; consequently, 
the decision to order an MRI is controversial.METHODS A total of 1,206 patients 
coded as having idiopathic scoliosis were identified from our institutional 
database. Of these, 72 patients had one or more atypical features: early-onset 
scoliosis, atypical curve, severe curve despite immaturity (>45 degrees ), 
rapidly progressive curve (>1 degrees per month), back pain, headache, or 
neurologic abnormalities on clinical examination. All 72 patients underwent 
brain and spinal cord MRI. Logistic regression was used to determine significant 
predictors of positive MRI and to define the prognostic model.
RESULTS: Eleven patients (15%) had abnormal findings on MRI. Eight had an 
Arnold-Chiari type I malformation associated with a syrinx; 1 had an 
Arnold-Chiari type I malformation; 1 a syrinx; and 1 a cervical syrinx with a 
conus lipoma. MRI was positive in 5 of 9 patients (55%) with severe curves 
despite immaturity. Twenty patients had one or more abnormal neurologic signs. 
Of these, 8 (40%) had a positive MRI, while only 3 of the 52 patients (6%) with 
a normal neurologic examination (but other atypical features) had a positive 
MRI. The most predictive model included the variables neurologic abnormalities 
(yes or no) and severe curve despite immaturity (yes or no). Using this model, 
patients with atypical characteristics other than severe curvatures or abnormal 
neurologic abnormalities(s) had a 3% probability (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1-12%) of having a positive MRI; patients with abnormal neurologic change(s), 
but a nonsevere curve, had a 29% probability of a positive MRI (95% CI, 12-53%) 
and patients with severe curves and no neurologic change(s) had a 32% 
probability of positive MRI (95% CI, 8-71%). Patients with both a severe curve 
and abnormal neurologic change(s) had an 86% probability of positive MRI (95% 
CI, 46-98%). Agreement between this test and the MRI was 75%, with a sensitivity 
of 82% (95% CI, 48-97%) and a specificity of 74% (95% CI, 61-83%).
CONCLUSIONS: The model derived in this study indicates that the probability of 
neurogenic lesions is extremely low in most patients with idiopathic scoliosis 
with atypical features. However, patients with severe curves despite skeletal 
immaturity and an abnormal neurologic examination have a significant probability 
of neurogenic lesions. Therefore, clinical efficiency will be enhanced by 
narrowing the indications for MRI to those patients with these risk factors.

Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. m.a.vandenbosch@azu.nl

AIM: To review abnormalities reported on plain radiographic examination of the 
lumbar spine in patients referred with low back pain by general practitioners. 
Additionally, we evaluated and stratified the prevalence of these abnormalities 
by age. Finally, the diagnostic impact of lumbar spine radiography for the 
diagnosis of degenerative change, fracture, infection and possible tumour, was 
modelled.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 2007 radiographic reports of 
patients referred with low back pain for lumbar spine radiography to a large 
radiology department was performed. The reports were classified into different 
diagnostic groups and subsequently stratified according to age. The potential 
diagnostic impact of lumbar spine radiography was modelled by using the 
prevalence of conditions studied as pre-test probabilities of disease.
RESULTS: The prevalence of reported lumbar spine degeneration increased with age 
to 71% in patients aged 65-74 years. The overall prevalence of fracture, 
possible infection, possible tumour was low in our study population: 4, 0.8 and 
0.7%, respectively. Fracture and possible infection showed no association with 
age. Possible tumour was only reported in patients older than 55 years of age.
CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of degenerative changes was high in older 
patients, the therapeutic consequences of diagnosing this abnormality are minor. 
The prevalence of possible serious conditions was very low in all age 
categories, which implies radiation exposure in many patients with no 
significant lesions.

Conjoined lumbosacral nerve roots: current aspects of diagnosis.

Conjoined lumbosacral nerve roots (CLNR) are the most common anomalies involving 
the lumbar nerve structures which can be one of the origins of failed back 
syndromes. They can cause sciatica even without the presence of a additional 
compressive impingement (such as disc herniation, spondylolisthesis or lateral 
recess stenosis), and often congenital lumbosacral spine anomalies (such as bony 
defects) are present at the "conjoined sheaths". This congenital anomaly has 
been reported in 14% of cadaver studies, but myelographic or computed 
tomographic studies have revealed an incidence of approximately 4% only. 
Diagnostic methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are helpful for 
determination of the exact anatomical relations in this context. We present five 
typical cases of conjoined nerve roots observed during a 1 year period, 
equivalent to 6% of our out-patients without a history of surgical treatment on 
the lumbar spine. In all cases with suspicious radiological findings MRI or 
lumbar myelography combined with CT and multiplanar reconstructions is 
recommended.

kmakay45@hotmail.com

Although split cord malformations have been well documented in children, there 
is no consensus about their surgical indications and clinical course in adults 
because of their rarity. Medical records of nine young adult patients with split 
cord malformations were reviewed retrospectively. The most common complaint was 
radicular low back pain persisting more than 1 year, and the most common finding 
was hypertrichosis. Adult split cord malformation patients in our series had 
neither scoliosis nor foot deformities. Radiologically, all had low-situated 
conus medullaris. Eight of them underwent surgery. The radicular low back pain 
decreased in all the surgically treated patients at short-term follow-up but had 
not disappeared. Although pain originating from split cord malformations seems 
to be the most common surgical indication in adult patients and shows good 
short-term results, in our opinion long-term pain improvement is necessary for 
confirmation. According to our results, it seems that symptomatic young adults 
with split cord malformations are good candidates for complaint and deficit 
stabilization surgery.

The effect of opioid analgesia on exercise test performance in chronic low back 
pain.

The effect of opioid analgesia on tests of muscular function in chronic low back 
pain (CLBP) is unknown. Twenty-eight subjects with CLBP of at least moderate 
intensity performed the Sorensen isokinetic exercise test once after receiving 1 
microg/kg fentanyl intravenously and once after placebo in a randomized-order 
double-blind crossover design. Naloxone 3 microg/kg was administered after the 
fentanyl phase. Fentanyl reduced mean+/-SD pain from 4.0+/-2.1 to 3.1+/-2.2 on a 
0-10 verbal rating scale (P<0.05). Mean+/-SD Sorensen test performance was 
77+/-49 s in the fentanyl arm and 60+/-42 s in the placebo arm. This represents 
an increased performance with fentanyl of 28% (P<0.001). We conclude that in 
addition to relieving pain in CLBP, the administration of 1 microg/kg fentanyl 
is associated with an improvement in lumbar exercise test performance. We 
presume that the pain relief resulted in increased test performance. Our result 
is at odds with those of randomized trials which have failed to demonstrate 
increased function following the treatment of pain with opioid analgesics. This 
highlights the complexity of the interaction between pain, analgesia and changes 
in function.

This study compared overuse injuries, small abnormalities, and pain alone in 
different types of skiing and activity levels. Subjects were 45 ski high school 
athletes aged 15-19 years. We found the back and knees significantly more prone 
to activity-related injuries and pain than other body regions. Thirty subjects 
(67%) had low back pain on the first examination, and 17 had pain caused by 
overuse of the back. This was more frequent among active, young competitive boys 
in the cross-country skiing group, with mature height less than 99%, than among 
noncompetitive boys in the same group or among the alpine skiers. Neck pain was 
reported only by girls. Eight subjects had low back pain related to small 
abnormalities. The subjects were given counseling about training and 
physiotherapy. The 1-year follow-up found a significant reduction in back pain 
due to overuse injuries (from 17 to 3 subjects) and indistinct neck pain (from 
10 to 2) but no reduction in pain in those with small abnormalities in the low 
back. Low back pain was common in young athletes, particularly in cross-country 
skiers. Excessively rapid progression of training and faulty technique increased 
back pain complaints from 36% when entering the school to 67% at the first 
examination. A proper evaluation and treatment of overuse injuries and accurate 
counseling of training types, volume, and progression reduced the low back pain 
problems to 29% of subjects 1 year later in spite of a maintained high activity 
level. A minimum entrance requirement to conditioning seems mandatory for 
students attending a ski high school.

OBJECTIVE: To compare a new MRI scoring system of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) 
in early spondylarthropathy (SpA) with clinical and laboratory parameters.
METHODS: Forty-one patients (24 males, 17 females) with a median age of 26 yr 
and a median duration of inflammatory low back pain of 19 months were included. 
They all fulfilled the ESSG-criteria for SpA. The patients were examined by MRI 
of the SIJs using a new scoring system. Clinical examinations, biochemical 
tests, functional score (BASFI), and pain score (BASDAI) were also performed.
RESULTS: 95% of the patients had inflammation and/or destructive bone changes of 
the SIJs at MRI. No correlation was found between MRI pathology and clinical 
findings. MRI demonstrated significantly greater severity of both inflammation 
and destruction of the SIJs in HLA B27 positive patients than in the HLA B27 
negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early SpA, MRI was able to detect inflammatory and 
destructive changes of the SIJs, but the changes were not associated to clinical 
findings. Our results suggest a role of MRI in the detection of early-stage 
sacroiliitis.

CONTEXT: The societal costs of low back pain and associated disability are 
immense. However, very little is known about the etiology of low back pain. 
Lumbar disc disease was discovered in the last century and became the 
predominant etiology for back pain. Today we know that for the majority of low 
back pain cases, a specific etiology cannot be determined.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the evolution of the "disc paradigm" and to compare our 
contemporary understanding to the scientific discussion in the beginning of the 
last century.
DESIGN: Survey of the highest ranked German medical journal from 1900 to 1999.
DATA EXTRACTION: The indexes of 5185 journal issues of the Deutsche Medizinische 
Wochenschrift were reviewed for articles about low back pain.
DATA SYNTHESIS: For each article, the etiologies were identified, categorized, 
and counted per decade. In addition, each important etiology was described.
CONCLUSIONS: In the beginning of the last century, many heterogeneous etiologies 
coexisted. In the second half of the century, the theory of disc degeneration 
took over almost the entire literature about low back pain. Pre-existing 
theories disappeared, but re-entered the discussion in the last decade. Two 
factors seemed to influence this development: 1) a tendency to prefer organic, 
visible abnormalities as etiologies; and 2) an inclination to trust technical 
diagnostic results more than clinical judgment.

Lumbosacral interspinous ligament rupture associated with acute intrinsic spinal 
muscle degeneration.

Jinkins JR(1).

Author information:
(1)Medical College of Pennsylvania-Hahnemann, Drexel University, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate lumbosacral interspinous ligament rupture, with or 
without related paraspinal muscle degeneration.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study consisted of a prospective imaging analysis of 
100 consecutive MRI studies in adult patients (mean age: 56 years) presenting 
with low back pain. Alterations from the normal in the inter- and perispinal 
structures of the spine and perispinal soft tissues (e.g. spinal ligaments, 
perispinal muscles) were sought based upon studies on young volunteers without 
low back pain (n = 10; mean age: 23 years).
RESULTS: Compared to the group without low back pain, many index cases (n = 71: 
71%) demonstrated hyperintensity (i.e., sprain or frank ligamentous rupture) of 
the interspinous ligament(s) on T2-weighted, fat suppressed MRI studies at one 
(n = 20/71:28%) or multiple (n = 51/71:72%) levels. Associated paraspinal muscle 
(e.g., interspinalis, multifidus muscles) degeneration was observed in a 
minority of cases overall (n = 7: 7%), but was only seen in association with 
cases also demonstrating interspinous ligament degeneration/rupture (n = 
7/71:10%).
CONCLUSION: Lumbosacral interspinous ligament sprain or frank rupture, as well 
as related acute-subacute autotraumatic paraspinal muscle rupture/degeneration, 
may be overlooked by many observers if fat suppressed, T2-weighted MRI is not 
acquired. These musculoligamentous alterations are on occasion the only 
abnormalities recognized on MRI of the lumbosacral spine and may theoretically 
be sources of low back morbidity that potentially may respond to specific 
therapy. Because this study was an observational one, based solely upon medical 
imaging, future research must focus upon the correlation of the relevance of 
these findings with an age-matched asymptomatic control group and longitudinal 
clinicoradiologic therapeutic trials.

The functional relationship between the craniomandibular system, cervical spine, 
and the sacroiliac joint: a preliminary investigation.

The hypothesis of a functional coupling between the muscles of the 
craniomandibular system and the muscles of other body areas is still 
controversial. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine whether there is a 
relationship between the craniomandibular system, the craniocervical system and 
the sacropelvic region. To test this hypothesis, the prevalence and localization 
of dysfunction of the cervical spine and the sacroiliac joint were examined in a 
prospective, experimental trial. Twenty healthy students underwent an artificial 
occlusal interference, which caused an occlusal interference. The upper cervical 
spine (CO-C3) and the sacroiliac joint were examined before, during and after 
this experimental test. The primary outcome with these experimental conditions 
was the occurrence of hypomobile functional abnormalities. In the presence of 
occlusal interference, functional abnormalities were detected in both regions 
examined and these changes were statistically significant. The clinical 
implications of these findings may be that a complementary examination of these 
areas in CMD patients could be useful.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of all CT scans of pelvis and abdomen 
performed at our institution in October and November 2000.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and extent of radiographic pelvic 
asymmetry in a population of patients not preselected for having low back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pelvic asymmetry refers to asymmetric positioning of 
landmarks on the two sides of the pelvis and may have a structural or functional 
etiology. Pelvic asymmetry can be associated with the presence of true leg 
length discrepancy, lead to false diagnosis or inaccurate measurement of leg 
length discrepancy, or itself be independently associated with back pain. 
Although the prevalence of pelvic asymmetry has been reported in patients with 
back pain to be 24-91%, its prevalence in the general population is not known.
METHODS: A total of 323 consecutive CT scans of the pelvis/abdomen were assessed 
for pelvic asymmetry by one of three examiners. Pelvic asymmetry was defined as 
an unequal distance from the iliac crests to the acetabuli bilaterally, measured 
on the anteroposterior scout view of the CT scan. Measurements made on 30 
randomly selected scans by the three examiners were used to assess interrater 
reliability of the measurement method.
RESULTS: Pelvic asymmetry ranged in magnitude from -11 mm to 7 mm [right pelvis 
(mm) - left pelvis (mm)]. Pelvic asymmetry was >5 mm in 17 of 323 (5.3%) and >10 
mm in 2 of 323 (0.6%) of the subjects; 172 of 323 (53.3%) had a smaller right 
hemipelvis (mean asymmetry = -3.0 mm). A total of 95 of 323 (29.4%) had a 
smaller left hemipelvis (mean asymmetry = 2.1 mm). The intraclass correlation 
coefficient [ICC(2,1)] between the three observers was high (0.91).
CONCLUSION: Pelvic asymmetry of >5 mm was uncommon, with a prevalence of 
approximately 5% in the population studied. CT scanography was found to be a 
practical and reliable method for the assessment of suspected pelvic asymmetry.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively document the satisfaction of a random sample of 
patients attending a specialized multidisciplinary spinal pain unit in the 
Australian public health care system and to collect associated data on patient 
characteristics, radiological findings, treatment modalities used, and any 
significant complications. Design and setting Spinal pain syndrome patients 
attended the specialized Multidisciplinary Spinal Pain Unit at Townsville 
General Hospital and the Kirwan Community Health Centre (Queensland, Australia) 
for diagnosis and management (ie, chiropractic spinal manipulation, medication, 
or needle acupuncture). A patient satisfaction questionnaire was sent to a 
random sample of patients in this Queensland Government funded service that was 
approved by the health authority's Ethics Committee.
RESULTS: A total of 1775 new patients (949 men, 826 women; aged 10 to 91 years; 
average age = 43 years) visited the unit. Medical referral accounted for 40% of 
patients, chiropractic for 2%, osteopathy for 1%, and other referrals for 0.7%; 
40.3% were self-referred and 16% were specifically referred for a medicolegal 
consultation and examination following work-related or motor vehicle accident 
injuries. Thirty-nine patients (2.2%) were found to have acute pain (< 28 days). 
Of 941 patients who could accurately recall when symptoms first began, 69 (7.3%) 
presented with subacute pain (4 to 12 weeks duration), and 872 (92.7%) presented 
with chronic spinal pain syndrome (>12 weeks duration). Following extensive 
investigations, 1474 patients (83%) had radiologically identifiable 
abnormalities, including osseous or soft tissue anomalies. There was only 1 
significant complication (pneumothorax) out of 7831 acupuncture treatment 
sessions, representing 0.01% of patients and 0.006% of a total of 16,936 
examinations and treatments administered at the unit. The patient satisfaction 
questionnaire resulted in an extremely high satisfaction score.
CONCLUSION: A public hospital or community health center based specialized 
spinal pain syndrome unit is useful for referring clinicians who wish to obtain 
a further opinion for challenging spinal pain syndrome patients in the lower 
socioeconomic group that cannot afford private health care.

transitional vertebra.

Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae can alter the biomechanics of weight transfer 
at the affected spinal segment. Low-back pain may result. This study assessed 
what skeletal scintigraphy reveals about stress associated with a lumbosacral 
transitional vertebra in young patients with low-back pain.
METHODS: The study population included 48 patients (30 male, 18 female; age 
range, 6-19 y; mean age, 15.7 y) with low-back pain and a lumbosacral 
transitional vertebra. Skeletal scintigraphy was correlated with plain 
radiographs in all, CT in 12, and MRI in 11.
RESULTS: High uptake was shown at the articulation between the transverse 
process of a lumbosacral transitional vertebra and the sacrum in 39 (81%) of the 
patients. In 23 (59%) of the 39 patients with high uptake, this finding was 
shown only by SPECT. In 13 (81%) of the 16 for which the high uptake was shown 
by planar imaging, the anterior projection was more valuable than the posterior 
projection. In 9 (23%) of the 39 patients with high uptake at the 
transverse-sacral articulation, the lumbosacral transitional vertebra had not 
been noted in a radiographic report before skeletal scintigraphy but was 
identified through reevaluation or repetition of radiographs after skeletal 
scintigraphy. Radiographs showed sclerosis along the transverse-sacral 
articulation in only 8 (21%) of the 39 patients with high uptake. Findings 
indicating stress or motion at the joint were shown by CT in 6 (55%) of 11 and 
by MRI in 5 (63%) of 8 patients with high uptake at the transverse-sacral 
articulation who underwent these examinations.
CONCLUSION: Skeletal scintigraphy often indicates stress at the 
transverse-sacral articulation of young patients with low-back pain and a 
lumbosacral transitional vertebra. Showing evidence of stress is best 
accomplished using SPECT. Changes are usually not radiographically evident, but 
there is a trend for MRI and CT to show findings that imply stress or motion at 
the articulation. The unique ability of skeletal scintigraphy to provide this 
physiologic information supports its use in these patients.

H.

Western Australia, Australia.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational design study was conducted to 
determine lumbar repositioning error in 15 subjects who had chronic low back 
pain with a clinical diagnosis of lumbar segmental instability and 15 
asymptomatic participants.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether individuals with lumbar segmental instability 
have a decreased ability to reposition their lumbar spine into a neutral spinal 
position.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Proprioception of the lumbar spine has been 
investigated in individuals who have low back pain with variable results. The 
testing procedure's lack of sensitivity and the nonhomogeneity of groups may be 
responsible for the conflicting findings.
METHODS: Repositioning accuracy of the lumbar spine was assessed using the 
3Space Fastrak to determine error in 15 participants with lumbar segmental 
instability and 15 asymptomatic subjects. The participants were assisted into a 
neutral spinal sitting posture and then asked to reproduce this position 
independently over five trials separated by periods of relaxed full lumbar 
flexion.
RESULTS: Lumbosacral repositioning error was significantly greater in 
participants with lumbar segmental instability than in the asymptomatic group 
(t[28] = 2.48; P = 0.02. There also was a significant difference between the 
groups at each individual sensor.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that individuals with a clinical 
diagnosis of lumbar segmental instability demonstrate an inability to reposition 
the lumbar spine accurately into a neutral spinal posture while seated. This 
finding provides evidence of a deficiency in lumbar proprioceptive awareness 
among this population.

The evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of the four main imaging modalities 
used in low back pain (plain radiographs, CT, MR imaging, radionuclide bone 
scans) is variable in quality and limits the ultimate conclusions regarding the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. In addition, the 
frequent finding of abnormalities in normal adults limits the specificity of all 
of these tests. Nevertheless, MR imaging is likely in most cases to offer the 
greatest sensitivity and specificity for systemic diseases, and its performance 
is superior to that of radiographs and comparable with CT and radionuclide bone 
scans for most conditions causing neurologic compromise.

    Minim Invasive Neurosurg. 2004 Aug;47(4):258.

PURPOSE: We have already dealt with the technical and anatomical basics for 
thecaloscopy. The first results of clinical application are presented and the 
indications for its diagnostic and therapeutic use are described. The aetiology 
of aseptic arachnitis and the term "Wide spinal canal syndrome" are discussed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients who fulfilled the criteria for entry to 
the study were selected and the criteria were chosen according to German medical 
and legal rules. All patients underwent an endoscopic inspection and, if 
necessary, therapeutic manipulation under general anaesthesia.
RESULTS: In all cases the procedure was safely and successfully performed. The 
pathomorphology of the arachnoid was detected and endoscopically treated in 
almost all cases. Arachnoid cysts were successfully fenestrated and an 
intraspinal meningocoele treated with endoscopic assistance.
CONCLUSION: Thecaloscopy is a safe procedure if skilfully performed. It provides 
an opening for a wide range of new diagnostic and therapeutic options.

Aires, Argentina. osteologia@ciudad.com.ar

A 30-yr-old Caucasian man with a history of dorsal and lumbar back pain, which 
responded partially to antiinflammatory agents, was seen at our Unit. The 
biochemical bone markers showed an increment in bone alkaline phosphatase and 
urinary CTX. Serum phosphate tended to be low. Radiographic abnormalities were 
marked osteosclerosis in the pelvis and vertebral bodies without changes in 
size. Bone scintigraphy results were normal. The increase in bone mineral 
density (BMD) was greater in L2-L4 (+ 3.9 SDs) than in total skeleton (+ 1.4 
SDs). Analysis of skeletal subareas showed a marked increase in axial skeleton 
BMD: trunk, +4.0 SDs; spine, +2.5 SDs and pelvis, +4.5 SDs. BMD of the remaining 
subareas was found to be normal: skull, +0.04 SDs; arms, -0.3 SDs and legs, 
-0.05 SDs. The patient refused to have a bone biopsy. The radiologic, 
densitometric, and biochemical findings in the patient presented herein are 
compatible with axial osteomalacia. Evaluation of total skeleton BMD, and 
especially skeletal subareas, clearly indicated that the abnormal BMD was 
restricted to the spine and pelvis whereas the rest of the skeleton was not 
affected.

PURPOSE: To analyze the type and frequency of abnormalities of the sacroiliac 
joint (SIJ) in early seronegative spondylarthropathy (SpA) by MR in comparison 
with CT and radiography, assess the most appropriate MR sequences to be used, 
and introduce a new way of grading MR abnormalities of the SIJ.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The SIJs of 41 patients with early SpA (median duration of 
inflammatory low back pain of 19 months) were evaluated by MR imaging using 
STIR, T1, T2, and T1 fat saturated (FS) sequences before and after i.v. Gd 
contrast medium followed by staging of abnormalities. The findings were compared 
with those obtained by CT and radiography.
RESULTS: MR and CT had equal efficacy superior to radiography in staging of 
erosions and osseous sclerosis. Only MR allowed visualization and grading of 
active inflammatory changes in the subchondral bone and surrounding ligaments in 
addition to bone marrow fatty accumulations. T2-weighted sequences did not 
contribute to assessment of sacroiliitis.
CONCLUSION: MR of the SIJs is reliable in its visualization of joint erosions in 
early SpA and allows differentiation between active and chronic sacroiliitis. We 
recommend the following sequences: semicoronal T1 and both semicoronal and 
semiaxial STIR. If these images are normal, the examination can be finished; 
otherwise additional semicoronal T1 FS before and after i.v. contrast has to be 
performed as well as semiaxial post-contrast T1 FS.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of Koryo 
Hand-Acupuncture on health status(pain, trunk flexion, IADL, depression) of 
patients with chronic low back pain.
METHOD: This study used a quasi experimental pre-test and post-test design. Data 
were collected from December 1st, 2000 to December 20th, 2001. 63 chronic low 
back pain patients(35 experimental group, 28 control group) admitted to the 
Back-School and consented to this study. The experimental group participated in 
treatment : Koryo Hand-Acupuncture and AB-Bong. Two groups was homogeneity. 
After 4 weeks the effects of treatment on the health status was measured between 
experimental and control group. Data were analyzed using SPSSWIN 10.0 with 
crosstab, t-test, and paired t-test.
RESULT: In the experimental group, pain(t=4.85, p=.000) and IADL 
difficulty(t=2.05, p=.045) was significantly lower than those in the control 
group. It makes no difference trunk flexion(t=-1.60, p=.114) and 
depression(t=1.50, p=.138) between experimental and control group.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that Koryo-Hand Acupuncture is an effective 
method for reducing pain and IADL difficulty in patients with chronic low back 
pain, and is considered as a independent nursing intervention for chronic low

INTRODUCTION: Lower back pain (LBP) is one of the most frequent reasons for 
visits to basic and specialised health care centres and one of the commonest 
causes of referral for electromyographic (EMG) explorations. AIMS. The aim of 
this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical 
examination in patients with LBP and abnormal EMG findings.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out on 364 patients 
with LBP who had been referred to both basic and specialised clinics, and who 
were attended in the Electromyography Service of a hospital belonging to the 
Instituto de Seguros Sociales, throughout the years 2001 and 2002. The same 
clinical evaluation protocol (interview and physical examination) was applied to 
all the patients. They were also evaluated using the same electrophysiological 
protocol, which in all cases included a study of the H waves and the adductor 
longus, tensor fasciae latae, medial vastus, anterior tibial, extensor digitorum 
longus, the medial and lateral heads of gastrocnemius, gluteus maximus and 
paraspinal muscles. The abnormal EMG examination was taken as the reference 
criterion and we determined the sensitivity, specificity, probability ratio, pre 
test probability and post test probability of the following clinical categories: 
referred pain (RP), pain less than three months, muscular strength of 
dorsiflexors, plantarflexors and knee extensor mechanisms, hypaesthesia in the 
L4, L5, S1 dermatomes, patellar areflexia and Achilles areflexia.
RESULTS: From the clinical history and physical examination, the pain referred 
to the extremity showed the highest sensitivity (80.89%), but its specificity 
was the lowest. This contrasted with the other clinical findings which, in 
general, showed high specificity (between 82.6% for hypaesthesia in the L5 
dermatome and 97.5% for the weakness of the plantarflexors), but low sensitivity 
(from 6.37% for the weakness of the quadriceps to 35.67% for hypaesthesia in the 
L5 dermatome). Achilles areflexia showed the highest positive predictive value 
(85%) and the highest probability ratio (7.47), while the highest negative 
predictive value was found in pain referred to the extremity (68.75%).
CONCLUSION: Although the clinical history and findings from the physical 
examination do not allow the prediction of a normal or abnormal 
electrophysiological result in patients with LBP, the interview and some of the 
clinical tests do make it easier to select which patients should be referred for 
an EMG exploration, the purpose of which is to aid the diagnosis of a lumbar 
radiculopathy.

Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: In combination with other traditional Chinese medicines, Breynia 
officinalis, a species of Euphorbiaceae, has long been used to treat contusions, 
heart failure, venereal diseases, growth retardation, and conjunctivitis. B. 
officinalis, regarded as a poison, was mistaken for a similar plant, Securinega 
suffruticosa, and cooked in a soup used for the treatment of muscle soreness, 
lumbago, and as a tonic in this outbreak.
CASE SERIES: Nineteen patients, 11 males and 8 females (average age 49.2 +/- 9.1 
years) consumed an average of 130 mL (30-900 mL) of soup containing B. 
officinalis stems. Fourteen patients developed diarrhea, 10 experienced nausea 
and chilly sensations, 9 had sensations of abdominal fullness, and 7 suffered 
from vomiting. The results of liver function tests (LFTs) indicated that the 
observed maximum median level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 647U/L 
(range 89-9440 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 314 U/L (range 47-7756 
U/L), alkaline phosphatase 251 U/L (range 224-278 U/L), and gamma glutamyl 
transpeptidase 106 U/L (range 84-313 U/L). The median time to the observed 
median peak levels was 3 days for ALT, 2 days for AST, 5 days for alkaline 
phosphatase, and 12 days for gamma glutamyl transpeptidase. With supportive 
treatment, the majority of abnormalities in 14 of the cases resolved within 6 
months of exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of a soup containing B. officinalis Hemsley 
resulted in dose-related toxic effects. Clinical toxicity consisted primarily of 
gastrointestinal symptoms and signs and hepatotoxicity. Hepatocellular liver 
injury rather than cholestatic liver injury was observed. Marked jaundice did 
not develop.

    Equine Vet J. 2003 May;35(3):328; author reply 328.

REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: The pelvis is covered with extensive musculature 
and often presents a challenge in diagnostic imaging. Ultrasonography provides 
diagnostic information about soft tissue, articular cartilage and bone surfaces, 
although little information exists about the normal ultrasonographic appearance 
of the equine sacroiliac region.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical applicability of ultrasonographic 
examination in horses with sacroiliac pain.
METHODS: Horses presented to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Teaching 
Hospital for hindlimb lameness were evaluated and lower limb lameness was ruled 
out with examination and local anaesthesia. Twenty cases were diagnosed with 
sacroiliac pain, characterised by response to palpation over the tuber sacrale. 
Seven of the 20 had visible asymmetry of the tuber sacrale. Ultrasonography was 
performed percutaneously and per rectum. Structures imaged were measured and 
compared to normal reference measurements. Other methods used to confirm 
diagnoses included thermography, scintigraphy and radiology.
RESULTS: All 20 cases with sacroiliac pain showed ultrasonographic abnormalities 
of the sacroiliac area. Abnormalities were detected in the dorsal sacroiliac 
ligaments. Ligament size was significantly different from the normal ranges (P < 
0.01). Malalignment of the sacroiliac area and sacral fractures were also 
imaged.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography of the sacroiliac region aided diagnosis of 
ligament damage and displacement of bone surfaces; and may aid in monitoring the 
progression of healing.
POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Diagnostic ultrasound is readily available to most 
practitioners. Therefore the findings of this study show that diagnosis of 
sacroiliac injuries is possible in the field.

Disuse and deconditioning in chronic low back pain: concepts and hypotheses on 
contributing mechanisms.

Netherlands. j.verbunt@irv.nl

For years enhancement of a patient's level of physical fitness has been an 
important goal in rehabilitation treatment in chronic low back pain (CLBP), 
based on the hypothesis that physical deconditioning contributes to the 
chronicity of low back pain. However, whether this hypothesis in CLBP holds is 
not clear. In this paper, possible mechanisms that contribute to the development 
of physical deconditioning in CLBP, such as avoidance behaviour and suppressive 
behaviour, are discussed. The presence of both deconditioning-related 
physiological changes, such as muscle atrophy, changes in metabolism, 
osteoporosis and obesity as well as deconditioning related functional changes, 
such as a decrease in cardiovascular capacity, a decrease in muscle strength and 
impaired motor control in patients with CLBP are discussed. Results of studies 
on the level of physical activities in daily life (PAL) and the level of 
physical fitness in patients with CLBP compared to healthy controls were 
reviewed. In studies on PAL results that were either lower or comparable to 
healthy subjects were found. The presence of disuse (i.e., a decrease in the 
level of physical activities in daily life) in patients with CLBP was not 
confirmed. The inconclusive findings in the papers reviewed may partly be 
explained by different measurement methods used in research on PAL in chronic 
pain. The level of physical fitness of CLBP patients also appeared to be lower 
or comparable to the fitness level of healthy persons. A discriminating factor 
between fit and unfit patients with back pain may be the fact that fit persons 
more frequently are still employed, and as such may be involved more in physical 
activity. Lastly some suggestions are made for further research in the field of 
disuse and deconditioning in CLBP.

Detection of lumbosacral nerve root compression with a novel composite nerve 
conduction measurement.

Wells MD(1), Meyer AP, Emley M, Kong X, Sanchez R, Gozani SN.

Author information:

STUDY DESIGN: Multivariate logistic regression techniques were used to develop a 
composite nerve conduction measurement that detects lumbosacral (L5, S1, or 
both) nerve root compression.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a composite nerve conduction 
measurement for detection of lumbosacral nerve root compression.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Nerve root involvement is characterized by clinical 
abnormalities and confirmed by radiologic and electrodiagnostic studies. Imaging 
studies visualize structural abnormalities; however, they are associated with 
high false-positive rates. Electrodiagnostic methods assess the physiologic 
integrity of the nerve roots. One form of electrodiagnostic testing, nerve 
conduction studies, is widely used for evaluation of musculoskeletal and 
neuromuscular complaints. Although similar clinical value is expected for the 
evaluation of nerve root compromise, prior applications of nerve conduction 
studies have yielded widely varying results.
METHODS: Two groups of subjects were compared. The L5-S1 compression group was 
composed of 25 patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed lumbosacral 
(L5, S1, or both) nerve root compression and symptoms in the appropriate 
segmental distribution. The majority of subjects (22) had at least one of the 
following findings on physical examination: positive straight-leg raise test, 
diminished ankle reflexes, sensory loss, or weakness. The control group 
consisted of 35 asymptomatic individuals with no history of radiculopathy or 
potentially confounding neuropathology. The posterior tibial and deep peroneal 
nerves were evaluated bilaterally in all study subjects using standard nerve 
conduction procedures, which consisted of the measurement of distal motor 
latencies and F-wave latencies that assess nerve root pathophysiology. A 
composite nerve conduction measurement was determined using multivariate 
logistic regression analysis. The efficacy of the composite measurement was 
assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and by the 
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: Five F-wave latency parameters (peroneal mean F-wave latency, odds 
ratio = 0.42; peroneal seventh F-wave latency decile, odds ratio = 2.71; tibial 
mean F-wave latency, odds ratio = 8.90; tibial first F-wave latency decile, odds 
ratio = 0.47; tibial maximum F-wave latency, odds ratio = 0.44) were found to be 
predictive of nerve root compression. A composite nerve conduction measurement, 
NC composite, constructed from these five parameters (NC composite = exp(phi)/(1 
+ exp(phi)), phi = -31.2 + 1.0 * Per7 Decile - 0.88 * PerMean + 2.2 * TibMean - 
0.88 * Tib1 Decile - 0.83 * TibMax) yielded an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve of 0.91. At a threshold of 0.20, NC composite had a 
diagnostic specificity of 84.3% and a sensitivity of 83.3%.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that a novel composite nerve 
conduction measurement, based on F-wave latency parameters, may be highly 
effective at detecting magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed lumbosacral nerve 
root compression. Because these measurements provide objective evidence of 
functional nerve root compromise and are noninvasive, they may be of diagnostic 
value to clinicians evaluating patients presenting with low back and leg pain.

Classical Scheuermann disease in male monozygotic twins: further support for the 
genetic etiology hypothesis.

Graat HC(1), van Rhijn LW, Schrander-Stumpel CT, van Ooij A.

Author information:

The Netherlands.

STUDY DESIGN: Classic cases of Scheuermann disease in male monozygotic twins are 
reported.
OBJECTIVES: To report classic cases of Scheuermann disease or Scheuermann 
kyphosis in male monozygotic twins, and to discuss the previous two cases of 
classic Scheuermann disease in monozygotic twins and the genetic etiology theory 
of Scheuermann kyphosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The etiology of Scheuermann disease remains unclear. 
Both genetic and mechanical factors or a combination of the two have been 
postulated to explain Scheuermann disease. The genetic etiology hypothesis has 
been explained by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. In support of this 
genetic etiology hypothesis, two cases of Scheuermann disease in monozygotic 
twins have been reported in the English literature.
METHODS: The criteria of Sørensen and Sachs et al were used to diagnose 
Scheuermann kyphosis. Clinical examination and lateral spinal radiographs were 
performed on a male monozygotic twin. Both parents were clinically investigated 
for signs of a kyphotic deformity. RESULTS Scheuermann disease was noted in both 
patients at the same vertebral levels. The Cobb angle of the kyphosis was 74 
degrees and 48 degrees, respectively. Clinical examination of both parents did 
not show any kyphotic abnormality.
CONCLUSIONS: These cases of classic Scheuermann disease in monozygotic male 
twins support the theory that there is a genetic contribution in classic 
Scheuermann disease.

Elliott B(1), Khangure M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Human Movement and Exercise Science, The University of Western 
Australia, Crawley, Australia. Bruce.Elliott@uwa.edu.au

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between the 
incidence of lumber disk degeneration and bowling technique after 3 yr of 
educational intervention.
METHODS: Two groups of cricketers from the Western Australian fast-bowling 
development squads acted as subjects in this longitudinal study. Group 1 
comprised 24 fast bowlers, of mean age 13.4 yr at the commencement of the study. 
They attended at least three of the four yearly testing sessions between 1997 
and 2000. A further 17 of mean age (in 1998) of 13.2 yr attended a minimum of 
two of three yearly testing sessions between 1998 and 2000, and comprised group 
2. Players were filmed laterally and from above by two video cameras during each 
testing session. Specific technique variables that previously had been linked 
with an increased incidence of lumbar disk abnormalities were measured from the 
videos. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the lumbar disks of each 
player were also recorded at approximately the same time. A yearly half-day 
clinic and six small group coaching sessions spread over the season were held to 
assist the bowlers develop techniques that had been linked with a reduction in 
back injuries.
RESULTS: Data showed that small group coaching significantly reduced the level 
of shoulder alignment counter-rotation in young fast bowlers. The incidence and 
progression of lumbar disk degeneration were also significantly reduced in 
parallel with this decreased shoulder counter-rotation.
CONCLUSION: Technique assessment and modifications through an educational 
process aimed at reducing mechanical features that have been linked to back 
injury decreased the incidence and/or progression of lumbar spine disk 
degeneration.

Microsurgical anterior approaches to the lumbar spine for interbody fusion and 
total disc replacement.

Mayer HM(1), Wiechert K.

Author information:
(1)Orthopädische Klinik München-Harlaching Spine Center, Munich, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: Anterior approaches to the lumbar spine for the treatment of various 
degenerative or postoperative abnormalities associated with low back pain have 
always been a matter of debate. They are known to be associated with 
considerable surgical trauma, high postoperative morbidity, and, occasionally, 
unacceptably high complication rates. In 1997, we inaugurated two new 
microsurgical modifications of conventional anterior approach techniques, which 
have been applied in anterior lumbar interbody fusion and more recently in total 
disc replacement. This article describes the results of microsurgical anterior 
interbody fusion in a consecutive series of 171 patients as well as preliminary 
results of these techniques for total disc replacement in 26 patients.
METHODS: The approaches are performed with the use of a surgical microscope. 
Lumbar segments L2-L5 are exposed through a lateral retroperitoneal approach. 
L5-S1 can be reached through a midline retroperitoneal or transperitoneal 
approach. Both approaches can be performed through a limited skin incision of 4 
cm.
RESULTS: An independent observer evaluated results of anterior lumbar interbody 
fusion in 171 patients during a 2-year follow-up period. The clinical follow-up 
demonstrated low perioperative and postoperative morbidity with an average blood 
loss of less than 100 ml at the fusion site. Pseudoarthrosis rates were less 
than 5%, and clinical results, as evaluated in accordance with the scoring 
system developed by Prolo et al., did not differ significantly from conventional 
open techniques. Total disc replacement through a microsurgical anterior 
approach seems to be a promising alternative to fusion procedures with even less 
intraoperative and perioperative morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Microsurgical anterior approaches to the lumbar spine provide a 
reasonable surgical alternative to conventional approaches for anterior 
interbody fusion and total disc replacement.

giovanni.amato@unina2.it

Here we describe the uncommon case of a Caucasian male with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism due to 8 parathyroid glands discovered in the course of a 
surgical exploration. The patient (age 49 yr) with a 21-yr history of chronic 
renal failure came to our observation in June 1999 complaining of depression, 
muscle weakness, bone and joint pain, movement hindrance. The biochemical 
evaluation evidenced low-normal serum calcium, high phosphorus and PTH levels. 
The symptoms and the biochemical findings were suggestive for secondary 
hyperparathyroidism. The neck US revealed an increase of thyroid gland volume 
with diffuse hyperechogenity; two nodules of 20 and 25 mm as maximum diameter 
were found in the thyroid parenchyma, while 4 hypoechogenous nodules (maximum 
diameter ranging from 13.0 to 30.0 mm) with clean borders and anechogenous areas 
inside were evidenced in the rear side of the thyroid lobes. The parathyroid 
scan with 99mTc and 201 Tl demonstrated increased uptake bilaterally in the 
inferior side of the neck. The patient underwent a total parathyroidectomy with 
near total thyroidectomy in November 1999. Histological examination of surgical 
specimen evidenced 6 hyperplastic parathyroid glands in back side of the 2 lobes 
(3 on the right and 3 on the left), and the examination of the thyroid gland 
showed 2 hyperplastic parathyroids (5 mm and 15 mm maximum diameter) into the 2 
nodules previously evidenced by US. The physiopathological and clinical and 
therapeutic implications of this observation are discussed.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to describe the most prevalent 
physically disabling conditions for insured workers belonging to the Mexican 
Social Security Institute (IMSS) in the Valley of Mexico and to identify risk 
factors for disabling spondyloarthrosis.
METHODS: Retrospective cases and prevalent controls from IMSS clinics in the 
Mexico City metropolitan area were studied. Eighty cases were IMSS workers 
reporting disability due to spondyloarthrosis; 80 controls were active workers 
at the same workplace and shared the economic activity of the cases. The 1995 
IMSS Disability Report was reviewed. From this report congenital conditions of 
the musculoskeletal system, obesity, history of trauma, and sociodemographic 
patient characteristics were assessed.
RESULTS: The most important risk factors were a history of spina bifida (odds 
ratio [OR] = 29.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 5.3-161; p = 0.0009), 
supernumerary vertebrae (OR = 21.3, 95% CI = 5.3-95; p = 0.0001), history of low 
back (lumbar) trauma (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.9-8.3; p = 0.0004), flatfoot (OR = 
11.7, 95% CI = 1.9-69, p = 0.02), and obesity (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.06-4.03; p = 
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: A history of congenital deformity of the musculoskeletal system, 
spinal column trauma, and obesity were risk factors most associated with work 
disability due to spondyloarthrosis.

Slitlike syrinx cavities: a persistent central canal.

Holly LT(1), Batzdorf U.

Author information:
(1)Division of Neurosurgery, University of California at Los Angeles Medical 
Center, 90095-6901, USA.

OBJECT: The authors review their experience in the diagnosis and management of 
32 patients with slitlike syrinx cavities.
METHODS: There were 18 men and 14 women with a mean age of 40 years. Presenting 
symptoms that prompted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation were 
mechanical spinal pain (13 patients), radicular pain (seven patients), 
paresthesia (six patients), numbness (five patients), and muscle spasm (one 
patient). In 12 patients neurological examination demonstrated normal status, 
and in the remainder only minimal sensory or motor abnormalities were found. The 
mean diameter of the syrinx cavity was 2 mm (range 1-5 mm), and on average it 
covered three vertebral levels. The cavities were limited to the cervical region 
in 16 patients, the thoracic in 12, and both regions in four patients. The mean 
follow-up time for changes in clinical condition and repeated MR imaging 
features were 38 and 32 months, respectively. Thirty-one patients were treated 
nonoperatively, and one was treated surgically. During the follow-up period 
clinical improvement was documented in six patients, worsened status in seven, 
and no change was demonstrated in the clinical status of 19 patients. None of 
the syrinx cavities changed in size. In 16 patients medical workup revealed 
alternative diagnoses that were determined to be the true causes of each 
patient's symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Slitlike cavities likely do not represent true syringomyelia but 
rather remnants of the central canal detected in a small percentage of adults. 
Review of the authors' experience indicates that these cavities are asymptomatic 
and are unlikely to change in size. They can be considered an incidental 
finding, and in many of these patients another condition explaining the 
patient's symptoms may be found.

Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

A 46-year-old patient with left-side low back pain developed symptoms of 
dysphonia and throat irritation 24 hours after receiving a fluoroscopically 
guided steroid injection into the epidural space. A direct laryngoscopy 
performed before a second injection detected no abnormalities. When dysphonia 
reappeared 48 hours after that injection, laryngoscopy revealed edema in the 
anterior vocal cord with thick surrounding mucous. Full clinical resolution of 
the dysphonia was apparent by laryngoscopy 15 days after the second injection. 
The mechanism of dysphonia after epidural steroid injection is unknown, but it 
may result from a systemic steroid effect.

The relation among spinal geometry on MRI, paraspinal electromyographic 
abnormalities, and age in persons referred for electrodiagnostic testing of low 
back symptoms.

Haig AJ(1), Weiner JB, Tew J, Quint D, Yamakawa K.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Michigan, 
Ann Arbor, Michigan 48108, USA.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective EMG study with blinded radiologic measurement was 
conducted.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation among spinal measurements on MRI, 
paraspinal denervation, and age in patients referred for electrodiagnostic and 
radiologic evaluation of low back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal pathology, including disc herniation and 
spinal stenosis, can cause denervation of the paraspinal muscles. Various 
mechanisms including direct compression, inflammation, vascular compromise, and 
mechanical stretch of the posterior primary ramus may play a role in 
denervation. The relation between the amount of denervation and the size of the 
spinal canal can assist in understanding the pathophysiology of back pain. Since 
paraspinal denervation may increase with age in asymptomatic persons, age is an 
important covariable.
METHODS: At a university hospital, 44 patients referred to undergo both 
electrodiagnostic evaluation and MRI for low back pain were studied. The study 
investigated the relation among the following: 1) axial MRI spinal measurements 
(canal transverse diameter, anteroposterior diameter, and area; thecal sac 
anteroposterior diameter and area; and the radiologist's overall impression at 
each level) and denervation measurements in terms of scores on the MiniPM, a 
quantified needle electromyographic measure of paraspinal denervation; 2) 
various models of multilevel spinal compression (smallest, smallest two, and 
average spinal levels for each measurement) and MiniPM scores; and 3) MRI spinal 
canal measurements and age.
RESULTS: Although individual MRI measurements and combinations of measurements 
did not relate to MiniPM scores, the radiologist's impression was significantly 
related. The "smallest two" levels measurement had the strongest relation (r = 
0.400; P < 0.007). Age related to the MiniPM scores (P = 0.004) and radiologic 
impression (P = 0.031). A regression suggested that MiniPM was an independent 
predictor of age.
CONCLUSIONS: The radiologist's overall impression is more accurate than axial 
image measurements in predicting paraspinal denervation. A combination score of 
the smallest two levels is the most accurate, perhaps relating to the vascular 
pathophysiology of stenosis. There is more denervation with increasing age in 
this symptomatic population.

Chennai.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the clinical profile of various subtypes of juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in adulthood and analyse the outcome of the disease 
in terms of functional status, educational achievement, growth abnormalities, 
radiological progression and activity of the disease.
METHODS: From a group of 150 JRA cases, 26 adult patients were included in the 
study. All of them were under follow up since the onset of disease in childhood. 
Clinical data at the onset were obtained from old medical documents. Detailed 
clinical and laboratory assessment of all cases were done.
RESULTS: There were 10 oligoarticular, 13 polyarticular and three systemic onset 
cases. Mean age of onset of disease was 11.7 +/- 3.39 years (range 2-15). Mean 
duration of follow up was 11.4 +/- 4.46 years range (6-22). Twenty-one patients 
had active disease. Ninety percent of oligoarthritis group were in class 1 
status whereas none of the systemic onset JRA cases were in class I. 
Micrognathia, short stiff neck and short stature were noticed among 
polyarticular and systemic onset JRA. Seventy percent of oligoarthritis group 
developed inflammatory low back ache. Bony ankylosis of tarsal and carpal bones 
were seen in eight cases.
CONCLUSION: In our study there is a male predominance in JRA. Pauciarticular 
(oligoarthritis) JRA occurring in older boys had the best functional outcome. 
Growth abnormalities and radiological changes were more common in polyarticular 
and systemic onset JRA.

OBJECTIVE: This study measured functional capacity and subjective pain in 
patients with chronic neck pain before and after manipulation of the cervical 
spine.
DESIGN: Outcomes study on 16 patients with chronic neck pain.
BACKGROUND: Muscle inhibition, i.e., the inability to fully activate a muscle, 
has been observed following joint pathologies and in low back pain conditions. 
Although chronic neck pain has been associated with changes in muscle 
recruitment and coordination in the shoulder and arms, the possibility of muscle 
inhibition has not been explored.
METHODS: Biceps activation during a maximal voluntary elbow flexor contraction 
was assessed using the interpolated twitch technique and electromyography. 
Cervical range of motion and pressure pain thresholds were measured using a 
goniometer and an algometer. Manipulation of the cervical spine was applied at 
the level of C5/6/7, and functional assessments were repeated.
RESULTS: Patients showed significant inhibition in their biceps muscles. 
Cervical range of motion was restricted laterally, and increased pressure pain 
sensitivity was evident. After cervical spine manipulation, a significant 
reduction in biceps inhibition and an increase in biceps force occurred. 
Cervical range of motion and pressure pain thresholds increased significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant dysfunction in biceps activation was evident in 
patients with chronic neck pain, indicating that this muscle group cannot be 
used to the full extent. Spinal manipulation decreased muscle inhibition and 
increased elbow flexor strength at least in the short term.
RELEVANCE: Muscle inhibition in the biceps has not been previously documented in 
patients with chronic neck pain. Further research is needed to establish whether 
muscle inhibition is related to clinical symptoms and functional outcome. Spinal 
manipulation improved muscle function, cervical range of motion and pain 
sensitivity, and might therefore be beneficial for treating patients with 
chronic neck pain.

Effectiveness of transforaminal epidural steroid injections in low back pain: a 
one year experience.

of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.

Transforaminal epidural steroid injections under fluoroscopy are an alternative 
treatment for lower back pain with radiculopathy. We followed 82 patients with a 
standardized telephone questionnaire at 2, 6, and 12 months after the first 
injection, in order to assess their effectiveness. Ninety-two patients with 
radiculopathic back pain due to spinal stenosis, herniated discs, 
spondylolisthesis, and degenerated discs, underwent transforaminal epidural 
steroid injections under fluoroscopy. Eighty-two patients were followed with a 
standardized telephone questionnaire. The population was divided into four 
groups: Group I, previous back surgery (16%); Group II, discogenic 
abnormalities: herniations, bulges, or degeneration, (42%); Group III, spinal 
stenosis (32%); Group IV, those without MRI (11%). Age ranged between 24 to 99 
years, mean 64.5. Forty-seven were female, 35 male. Thirteen patients (16%) 
underwent one procedure, 27 patients (33%) two, 37 patients (45%) three, and 
five patients (6%) four, an average 2.4 procedures per patient. The pain scores 
for all patients improved significantly at all three time points (2, 6 and 12 
months) compared to the initial mean pain score of 7.3 to mean pain scores of 
3.4, 4.5 and 3.9 respectively. After one year, 36 patients did not take any pain 
medications. Greater than 50% improvement after one year was seen in 23% of 
Group I; 59% in Group II; 35% in Group III and 67% in Group IV. Transforaminal 
epidural steroid injections can offer significant pain reduction up to one year 
after initiation of treatment in patients with discogenic pain and possibly in 
patients with spinal stenosis.

Recent investigations of dysfunctional pain processing in the central nervous 
system have contributed much knowledge about the development of chronic 
musculoskeletal pain. Many common chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes - 
including regional myofascial pain syndromes, whiplash pain syndromes, 
refractory work-related neck-shoulder pain, certain types of chronic low back 
pain, fibromyalgia and others - may essentially be explained by abnormalities in 
central pain modulation. The growing awareness of dysfunctional central pain 
modulation may be a conceptual breakthrough leading to a better understanding of 
common chronic pain disorders. A new paradigm will have multiple clinical 
implications, including re-evaluation of clinical practice routines and 
rehabilitation methods, and will focus on controversial issues of medicolegal 
concern. The concept of dysfunctional central pain processing will also 
necessitate a mechanism-based classification of pain for the selection of 
individual treatment and rehabilitation programs for subgroups of patients with 
chronic musculoskeletal pain due to different pathophysiological mechanisms.

Radicular compression by lumbar intraspinal epidural gas pseudocyst in 
association with lateral disc herniation. Role of the posterior longitudinal 
ligament.

Among unusual abnormalities of the lumbar spine reported since the introduction 
of Computed Tomography (CT), the presence of gas lucency in the spinal canal, 
known as vacuum phenomenon, is often demonstrated. On the contrary, epidural gas 
pseudocyst compressing a nerve root in patients with a lateral disc herniation 
has rarely been reported. We report a case of a 44-year-old man who experienced 
violent low back pain and monolateral sciatica, exacerbated by orthostatic 
position, one week before admission. A lumbosacral spine CT showed the presence 
of vacuum phenomenon associated with a degenerated disc material and a 
capsulated epidural gas collection with evidence of root compression. A 
microsurgical interlaminar approach was carried out and, before the posterior 
longitudinal ligament was entered, a spherical "bubble" compressing the nerve 
roots was observed. The capsulated pseudocyst was dissected out, peeled off and 
excised en bloc. A large part of the posterior longitudinal ligament and the 
lateral disc herniation were removed. Postoperatively the patient was completely 
free of symptoms. The mechanism of exacerbation of pain was probably due to the 
increased radicular compression in the upright posture and, besides the presence 
of a lateral disc herniation, could be related to a pneumatic squeezing of gas 
from the intervertebral space into the well capsulated sac by the solicitated 
L4-L5 motion segment. Histological study of the wall of the pseudocyst showed 
the presence of fibrous tissue identical to the ligament. We conclude that, in 
case of a lumbar disc herniation, it is recommended to perform a complete 
microdiscectomy and an accurate removal of the involved portion of posterior 
longitudinal ligament in order to prevent pseudocystic formations.

Riedel's thyroiditis and retroperitoneal fibrosis in multifocal fibrosclerosis: 
positron emission tomographic findings.

Drieskens O(1), Blockmans D, Van den Bruel A, Mortelmans L.

Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

PURPOSE: The authors describe F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomographic (FDG PET) imaging features of Riedel's thyroiditis and 
retroperitoneal fibrosis in a patient with multifocal fibrosclerosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 41-year-old woman in whom Riedel's thyroiditis had been 
diagnosed 7 months earlier was examined for fatigue, anorexia, and lower back 
pain, irradiating to the abdomen. Abdominal sonography and computed tomography 
showed a retroperitoneal mass. A biopsy of this mass showed histopathologic 
findings of retroperitoneal fibrosis. FDG PET was performed to evaluate the 
activity of the retroperitoneal fibrosis and to screen for other areas of 
fibrosclerosis.
RESULTS: The FDG-PET images showed an intense hypermetabolic abdominal mass 
surrounding the aorta and increased glucose metabolism in the thyroid. No other 
sites of abnormal FDG metabolism were noted. These abnormalities disappeared 
after 4 months of steroid therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Sites of multifocal fibrosclerosis can be demonstrated by FDG PET, 
probably as a result of active inflammation involving lymphocytes, plasma cells, 
and fibroblast proliferation. FDG PET can help to establish the diagnosis of 
multifocal fibrosclerosis and evaluate the activity and patient response to 
corticosteroid therapy.

Possible role of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament in women with peripartum 
pelvic pain.

Vleeming A(1), de Vries HJ, Mens JM, van Wingerden JP.

Author information:
(1)Spine and Joint Center, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: To enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology of women with 
peripartum pelvic pain, it is necessary to couple anatomical insights with 
relevant clinical research. In this context, the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament 
is especially of interest because it was noticed that women diagnosed with 
peripartum pelvic pain frequently experience pain within the boundaries of this 
ligament. Njoo (1) found a high intertester reliability and a high specificity 
for long dorsal sacroiliac ligament pain. The present article focuses on the 
possible role of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament in the pain pattern of 
women with peripartum pelvic pain. The diagnostic and therapeutic consequences 
are considered.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis was performed in a homogenous group of 
women meeting strict criteria for posterior pelvic pain since pregnancy, 
diagnosed as having peripartum pelvic pain and excluded for any history of 
fracture, neoplasm or previous surgery of the lumbar spine, the pelvic girdle, 
the hip joint or the femur. The patients were also excluded for signs indicating 
radiculopathy: asymmetric Achilles tendon reflex and/or (passive) straight leg 
raising restricted by pain in the lower leg.
METHODS: The study group comprised 178 women diagnosed with peripartum pelvic 
pain, selected from the outpatient clinic of a specialized rehabilitation 
center. Selection was based on criteria enabling a strict division between 
lumbar and pelvic complaints. Pain in the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament was 
detected by standardized palpation of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament by 
specifically trained physicians and scored on a modified scale. Comparisons with 
the posterior pelvic pain provocation test and the active straight leg raise 
test was carried out.
RESULTS: The present study confirms that the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament 
frequently shows tenderness on palpation in patients with peripartum pelvic 
pain. Sensitivity was 76%. Sensitivity in a group of 133 women of the study 
group that scored positive on both active straight leg raise and posterior 
pelvic pain provocation tests was 86%. When only severe pelvic patients were 
included, sensitivity increased to 98%. In comparisons between the posterior 
pelvic pain provocation and the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament tests on the 
left and right side, Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.33 and 0.41, 
respectively. In comparisons between the active straight leg raise and the long 
dorsal sacroiliac ligament tests on the left and right side, Pearson's 
correlation coefficient was 0.35 and 0.41, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study, carried out on a group of peripartum pelvic pain 
patients with strict in- and exclusion criteria, attempts to further elucidate 
the pathophysiology of patients with peripartum pelvic pain by adding a simple 
pain provocation test. It is concluded that the combination of the active 
straight leg raise, the posterior pelvic pain provocation and the long dorsal 
sacroiliac ligament pain tests combined with the proposed in- and exclusion 
criteria seems promising in differentiating between mainly lumbar and pelvic 
complaints. Although the sensitivity of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament pain 
test seems promising, further clinical study is necessary in targeting 
specifically the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament. It is suggested that studies 
initiated to show the prevalence of sacroiliac joint pain in patients presenting 
nonspecific lumbopelvic pain, by using intra-articularly double block injection 
techniques, should include a peripheral injection of at least the long dorsal 
sacroiliac ligament.

Childhood abuse and later medical disorders in women. An epidemiological study.

New Zealand. sarah.romans@stonebow.otago.ac.nz

BACKGROUND: There have been many studies documenting adverse psychiatric 
consequences for people who have experienced childhood and adult sexual and 
physical abuse. These include posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, 
depression, substance abuse, eating disorders and probably some personality 
disorders or trait abnormalities. Much less is known about the links between 
abuse and physical/psychosomatic conditions in adult life. Hints of causal links 
are evident in the literature discussing headache, lower back pain, pelvic pain 
and irritable bowel syndrome. These studies are not definitive as they use 
clinic-based samples.
METHODS: This study used interview data with a random community sample of New 
Zealand women, half of whom reported childhood sexual abuse and half who did 
not. Details about childhood physical abuse and adult abuse were also collected 
in a two-phase study.
RESULTS: Complex relationships were found, as abuses tended to co-occur. Seven 
of 18 potentially relevant medical conditions emerged as significantly increased 
in women with one or more types of abuse. These were chronic fatigue, bladder 
problems, headache including migraine, asthma, diabetes and heart problems. 
Several of these associations with abuse are previously unreported.
CONCLUSIONS: In this random community sample, a number of chronic physical 
conditions were found more often in women who reported different types of sexual 
and physical abuse, both in childhood and in adult life. The causal 
relationships cannot be studied in a cross-sectional retrospective design, but 
immature coping strategies and increased rates of dissociation appeared 
important only in chronic fatigue and headache, suggesting that these are not 
part of the causal pathway between abuse experiences and the other later 
physical health problems. This finding and the low co-occurrence of the 
identified physical conditions suggest relative specificity rather than a 
general vulnerability to psychosomatic conditions in women who have suffered 
abuses. Each condition may require separate further study.

Lumbosacral interspinous ligament rupture associated with acute intrinsic spinal 
muscle degeneration.

The objective of this study was to demonstrate lumbosacral interspinous ligament 
rupture, with or without related acute intrinsic spinal muscle degeneration. 
This study consisted of a prospective imaging analysis of consecutive 100 MRI 
studies in adult patients (mean age 56 years) presenting with low back pain. 
Alterations from the normal in the inter- and perispinal structures of the spine 
and perispinal soft tissues (e.g., spinal ligaments, perispinal muscles) were 
sought based upon studies on young volunteers without low back pain ( n=10; mean 
age 23 years). Compared with the group without low back pain, many index cases ( 
n=71, 71%) demonstrated hyperintensity (i.e., sprain or frank ligamentous 
rupture) of the interspinous ligament(s) on T2-weighted, fat-suppressed MRI 
studies at one (20 of 71, 28%) or multiple (51 of 71, 72%) levels. Associated 
intrinsic spinal muscle (e.g., interspinalis, multifidus muscles) degeneration 
was observed in a minority of cases overall ( n=7, 7%), but was only seen in 
association with cases also demonstrating interspinous ligament 
degeneration/rupture (7 of 71, 10%). Lumbosacral interspinous ligament sprain or 
frank rupture, as well as related acute-subacute autotraumatic intrinsic spinal 
muscle rupture/degeneration, may be overlooked by many observers if 
fat-suppressed, T2-weighted MRI is not acquired. These musculoligamentous 
alterations are on occasion the only abnormalities recognized on MRI of the 
lumbosacral spine and may theoretically be sources of low back morbidity that 
potentially may respond to specific therapy. Because this study was an 
observational one, based solely upon medical imaging, future research must focus 
upon the correlation of the relevance of these findings with an age-matched 
asymptomatic control group and longitudinal clinicoradiologic therapeutic 
trials.

Concomitant lower thoracic spine disc disease in lumbar spine MR imaging 
studies.

Our objective was to study the coexistence of lower thoracic-spine disc changes 
in patients with low back pain using a large field of view (FOV) in lumbar spine 
MR imaging. One hundred fifty patients with low back pain were referred to an MR 
examination. All patients were studied with a large FOV (27 cm), covering from 
the coccyx to at least the body of T11. Discs were coded as normal, protrusion, 
and extrusion (either epiphyseal or intervertebral). The relationship between 
disc disease and level was established with the Pearson chi(2) test. The T11-12 
was the most commonly affected level of the lower thoracic spine with 58 disc 
cases rated as abnormal. Abnormalities of T11-12 and T12-L1 discs were 
significantly related only to L1-L2 disease ( p=0.001 and p=0.004, respectively) 
but unrelated to other disc disease, patient's gender, and age. No correlation 
was found between other discs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine 
can detect a great amount of lower thoracic disease, although its clinical 
significance remains unknown. A statistically significant relation was found 
within the thoracolumbar junctional region (T11-L2), reflecting common 
pathoanatomical changes. The absence of relation with lower lumbar spine discs 
is probably due to differences in their pathomechanisms.

Stress reactions of the lumbar pars interarticularis: the development of a new 
MRI classification system.

Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA. ghollen1@rochester.rr.com

STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective study, multiple examiners reviewed lumbar 
magnetic resonance imaging scans to develop a new grading system for lumbar pars 
interarticularis stress reaction and spondylolysis. The resulting system can be 
used as a mechanism for classifying patients, and as a measurement tool for 
future studies assessing the outcome efficacy of lumbar magnetic resonance 
imaging in patients with abnormalities of the pars interarticularis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of patient assignment to five different 
grades of bone stress reaction involving the lumbar pars interarticularis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Injury to the lumbar pars interarticularis 
(spondylolysis) is reported to be a common cause of low back pain in young 
patients. High-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging using fat saturation 
techniques and dedicated coil technology is sensitive in detecting bone stress 
injuries of the lumbar pars interarticularis, and thus is an excellent method 
for diagnosis. It also may be useful in prognostic decision making for these 
patients. A reliable classification system is a fundamental requirement for 
performing the research assessing the relationship between lumbar MRI findings 
and prognosis.
METHODS: For this study, 55 young athletic patients undergoing evaluation for 
low back pain with suspected stress injury to the lumbar pars interarticularis 
underwent standardized lumbar magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5-T scanner. 
Magnetic resonance images were reviewed by three readers using a new magnetic 
resonance classification system developed for lumbar spondylolysis. The findings 
were assessed for both interobserver and intraobserver reliability for five 
possible combinations in a 5-grade classification system.
RESULTS: On magnetic resonance imaging, 42% of the patients demonstrated signal 
abnormalities of the lumbar pars interarticularis. The intraobserver and 
interobserver reliability coefficients for assigning the grade of pars 
interarticularis abnormality ranged, respectively, from 0.766 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.62-0.91) to 0.906 (95% CI, 0.80-1), and from 0.706 (95% CI, 
0.55-0.86) to 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance findings of stress reactions and spondylolysis 
of the lumbar pars interarticularis can be reliably classified into five grades 
by experienced readers. Further study is needed to determine the role of these 
findings in the management of young athletic patients with low back pain.

The aims of this study were to appreciate the prevalence of chronic low back 
pains in a public transport's company, to state characteristics and to identify 
categories of workers involved and medico-legal consequences. It is a cross 
sectional study. which used medical records of the occupational clinic. All 
workers who complained of low back pain in the past three years following the 
study were selected. Characteristics of workers, types of injuries, occupational 
and medico-legal consequences were looked out. Sixty nine cases were collected, 
they were exclusively males. 54 % of them were bus drivers, and 29% conductors. 
X rays abnormalities were found in 31.64%. Exposure to vibration due to damaged 
roads and decayed vehicles seems to be main etiologic factors. From a 
occupational and medico-legal standpoint, two patients were reported for workers 
compensation, three patients were reclassified in another job. Undamaged roads, 
ergonomic design of bus' seats, and medical screening during placement and 
routine medical examination are key issues in preventing low back pains.

Japan.

We report 2 patients with acute cholecystitis for which percutaneous 
transhepatic gallbladder aspiration (PTGBA) was useful. In Case 1, the patient 
was a 75-year-old woman who experienced a sudden onset of back pain and upper 
abdominal pain at night. Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed enlargement of the 
gallbladder with thickening of the wall, a sonolucent layer, and a stone in the 
neck of the gallbladder, which led to a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated thickening of the gallbladder wall 
and 2 areas of low-intensity signal. The pain and fever persisted, for which we 
performed PTGBA, aspirating about 113 ml of infected bile. Subsequently, the 
pain and fever subsided, and abdominal US revealed a reduction in the 
enlargement of the gallbladder with the persistence of thickening of the wall. 
On the eighth day after PTGBA, open abdominal cholecystectomy was performed. In 
Case 2, the patient was a 56-year-old woman who had right hypochondriac pain 
after supper. The pain gradually increased in severity. Abdominal US showed 
enlargement of the gallbladder with a thickened wall, a sonolucent layer, and a 
gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, which led to a diagnosis of acute 
cholecystitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed 
enlargement of the gallbladder with no abnormalities in the common bile duct. 
After admission to hospital, the pain and fever persisted, for which we 
performed PTGBA, aspirating about 50 ml of infected bile. Subsequently, the pain 
and fever vanished. Abdominal US revealed a reduction in the enlargement of the 
gallbladder with the persistence of thickening of the wall. On the seventh day 
after PTGBA, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. PTGBA seems useful for 
early alleviation of the symptoms of acute cholecystitis because of low 
invasiveness and ease of performance.

The auditory event related potentials in episodic and chronic pain sufferers.

Isparta, Turkey. serpildemirci@hotmail.com

To examine the cognitive processing differences in chronic and episodic pain 
sufferers, auditory event-related potentials (P300 or P3) were recorded in two 
consecutive trials from 23 chronic lower back pain patients, 22 episodic 
tension-type headache sufferers, and from 23 age- and sex-matched healthy 
persons. P3 latency and amplitude showed no difference between groups at first 
trial. Considering P3 latency habituation, healthy controls and episodic 
tension-type headache sufferers showed a significant change of P3 latency 
whereas lower back pain sufferers failed. Comparing the amount of habituation 
lower back pain sufferers stood clearly apart from healthy controls. Although 
there was a remarkable increase of P3 latency in episodic tension-type headache 
sufferers, the amount of habituation was not statistically different than it was 
in lower back pain sufferers. Significant P3 amplitude habituation was observed 
only in healthy controls. Actually, episodic tension-type headache sufferers 
also showed some degree of habituation, which was not statistically remarkable. 
The amount of amplitude habituation was not different between groups. No 
correlation was observed between P3 habituation and age, disease duration and 
symptom severity. These results may point to a disturbed attentional processing 
in chronic pain sufferers. Our findings suggest that in spite of a similar 
cortical information processing, the neurocognitive networks related with 
decision making and memory processing seem to work differently in chronic pain 
sufferers from those in episodic pain sufferers in repeating tasks. Taking into 
consideration the reported P3 habituation abnormalities in chronic migraine 
patients we can say that not the location of pain but rather its temporal 
pattern may have a role in disturbed attentional processing.

The authors report a series of 13 horseshoe kidneys observed over a 22-year 
period. All patients are men with a mean age of 39 years (20-65 years). The 
clinical features were dominated by abdomino-lumbar pain (nine cases). The 
horseshoe kidney was associated with renal stones in nine cases, uretero-pelvic 
junction syndrome in five cases and pyonephrosis in one case. The specific 
anatomic and surgical features of this rare malformation are emphasized and the 
therapeutic features of each uropathy associated with horseshoe kidney are 
discussed.

la Liberté, 68000 Colmar.

PURPOSE: To demonstrate the efficiency of the treatment of the lumbar disk 
herniation (LDH) with absolute alcohol.
MATERIALS/METHODS: From June 1997 to September 2000, 118 patients with 126 LDH, 
69 males and 49 females, aged 19 to 77 (mean age: 51.1 years) were treated with 
absolute alcohol nucleolysis. In 75 cases, the LDH were parasagittal, in 30 
foraminal, in 17 medial and in 4 extraforaminal. In most cases, the sensitive 
symptoms and motor or reflex abnormalities corresponded to the lumbar disc 
herniation level. Nucleolysis was made in ambulatory condition and each patient 
underwent general anesthesia. All procedures were performed in surgical 
conditions and controlled under digital fluoroscopy. The disc puncture was 
laterally made at the junction of middle and posterior thirds of the disc, under 
strict lateral fluoroscopic control. A discogram was obtained before ethanol 
injection. Injection dose of absolute alcohol was 0.4 ml. The realization time 
was about 15 minutes.
RESULT: Total improvement of symptoms was obtained in 97.55% of cases. Two 
patients remained with low-back pain and the failure treatment rate was 0.84% (1 
case).
CONCLUSION: Nucleolysis with ethanol is a very effective, safe and low cost 
treatment for any kind of LDH, that allows to treat several levels during the 
same procedure, and can be repeated several times. Nucleolysis with ethanol can 
be made in ambulatory condition and be proposed to patients who refuse surgical 
treatment and have allergic background.

University, Fukushima City, Japan.

Transitional vertebrae (TV) may be one of the risk factors for lumbar disc 
herniation. It is not clear, however, whether the presence of TV can affect the 
development of nerve-root symptoms. Our aim was to clarify this relationship. A 
total of 501 patients with lumbar degenerative disease and nerve-root symptoms 
was studied in respect of their level and the presence of TV. As a control 
group, 508 patients without low back pain or nerve-root symptoms were studied to 
establish the incidence of TV. In patients with disc herniation, the incidence 
was statistically higher and the mean age lower in patients with TV than in 
those without. In most patients, the symptomatic disc level was just above the 
TV. Similarly, in those with stenosis of the spinal canal without 
spondylolisthesis, the symptomatic disc level was most commonly just above the 
TV.

Lifestyle, minerals and health.

Campbell JD(1).

Author information:
(1)jcampbel@coastnet.com

This paper proposes that most poor health and behavioral conditions are related 
to a deficiency of essential minerals or an excess of toxic ones. Clients 
requesting a hair mineral analysis were required to complete a questionnaire 
including lifestyle, health status and diet. Most prevalent health conditions in 
order of frequency were: depression, allergies, low back pain, arthritis, 
cardiovascular disease and poor digestion. Most deficient minerals were 
chromium, magnesium, zinc and calcium. Aluminum was the most frequent toxic 
mineral. it is proposed that such mineral abnormalities were caused by an over 
consumption of nutrient-poor, highly processed foods such as white flour, sugar 
and harmful fats. Such a diet promotes poor lifestyles such as smoking, drug 
abuse, alcoholism and criminal activity. Poor diets and dangerous lifestyles 
precedes the development of most prevalent diseases. The most common one is 
cardiovascular disease which increased at an alarming rate in the last century.

Computer visualisation of the moving human lumbar spine.

Cooper R(1), Cardan C, Allen R.

Southampton, UK.

Disorders of the spine which lead to back pain are often mechanical in origin 
and, despite extensive research, diagnosis of the underlying cause remains 
problematical, yet back pain is one of the most common rheumatological symptoms 
presented to the general practitioner. Diagnosis must frequently be based upon 
evidence gathered at the segmental level which invariably means that imaging is 
used in the process. In addition, surgical fixation is increasingly used when 
the spinal column is considered to exhibit instability. A solid model of the 
spine creates the possibility of visualising spine motion, of assessing the 
effects of loading of the spinal column in conjunction with finite element 
analysis to investigate the consequences of vertebral fusion, and of planning 
surgical intervention. Such a model could also be valuable in medical education 
and for demonstrating spine motion to a patient to highlight abnormalities or 
the effects of treatment. This paper describes a three-dimensional visualisation 
of the human lumbar spine which runs on a personal computer operating under the 
Windows environment. The user interface enables the clinician to select the 
viewpoint for the spine model to allow the motion to be studied from different 
angles. Motion data are currently acquired from fluoroscopic image sequences but 
the model could be used to display data from different imaging modalities when 
they are developed sufficiently for spine motion studies.

Limited magnetic resonance imaging in low back pain instead of plain 
radiographs: experience with first 1000 cases.

AIM: We report our experience with the first 1000 patients with non-traumatic 
low back pain (LBP) without radiculopathy undergoing limited sequence magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) instead of plain radiography.
METHODS: Between January 1996 and December 1998, 1042 patients with low back 
pain unresponsive to conservative treatment were examined using a limited MR 
protocol comprising sagittal T1-weighted and STIR imaging. Plain radiographs 
were not performed.
RESULTS: Malignancy, infection, vertebral fracture, spondylitis, pars defects 
and cord tumours were detected in 20%. Of the 82 osteoporotic vertebral 
fractures detected, 51 (62%) were recent and 31 had normal marrow signal 
indicating that they were old. Eighty pars defects were identified, 45(56%) had 
spondylolisthesis, 29(37%) were undisplaced and 6 (7%) had pars oedema only. 
Neoplastic disease was found in 17(8%) of which none was suspected before 
imaging. Benign neoplastic diseases such as vertebral AVM/haemangiomata were 
excluded. Twenty-one patients had a variety of disorders including ankylosing 
spondylitis (7), large vessel aneurysm (3), discitis (2), ovarian cyst (2), 
sequestered disc (2), sacral insufficiency fracture (2) and one patient each 
with burst fracture, retroperitoneal haematoma and a previously unsuspected 
horseshoe kidney.
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with LBP are best assessed clinically and 
imaging is usually not required. In patients with worrying symptoms, MRI with a 
limited protocol detects a greater number of abnormalities than previously 
reported studies using plain radiographs and has replaced plain radiography in 
our hospital. We report our experience with the first 1000 patients and 
highlight issues such as protocols, detection rates and communication issues.

Health-related quality of life and somatization in patients with long-term low 
back pain: a prospective study with 109 patients.

Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. ranickel@mail.uni-mainz.de

STUDY DESIGN: For this study, a prospective cohort of 109 patients was recruited 
consecutively at an orthopedic inpatient unit of a university hospital. Three 
self-report instruments were administered to patients with sciatica believed to 
be caused by a herniated lumbar disc to examine their quality of life and 
psychic stress at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up visit.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether patients who have undergone a previous 
discectomy experience greater psychic stress than patients with no surgery, and 
to determine whether the groups differed regarding their health-related quality 
of life at the follow-up visit.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have described psychic 
abnormalities in patients with long-term back pain, particularly patients with 
severe chronicity (i.e., history of surgeries and persistent problems) or those 
who underwent a previous discectomy. Additionally, a series of studies has shown 
that psychic and psychosocial parameters exert a significantly greater influence 
on the success of treatment than do clinical and imaging findings or the extent 
of disc abnormality.
METHODS: The Short Form Health Survey 36, the Symptom Checklist 90, and 
Screening for Somatoform Disorders were administered to 109 patients 
consecutively treated in the authors' orthopedic university clinic, at baseline 
and at the 1-year follow-up visit.
RESULTS: In all the patients examined, the physical and mental quality of life 
improved regardless of their group classification. The psychological distress, 
according to the Symptom Checklist 90, was clearly reduced in both groups at the 
follow-up visit, with the exception of somatization, as indicated by Symptom 
Checklist 90 and Screening for Somatoform Disorders. Whereas the patients who 
had undergone surgery remained nearly unchanged with regard to their 
somatization, the patients with no previous surgery improved significantly, as 
indicated by Screening for Somatoform Disorders and Symptom Checklist 90. 
Somatization, particularly that surveyed by the comprehensive Screening for 
Somatoform Disorders, proved to be quite a stabile factor over time in both 
groups. The extent of the physical impairment before treatment was nearly the 
same in both groups, as indicated by Short Form Health Survey 36. Despite a 
markedly higher chronicity of reported problems, patients who had undergone 
surgery were hardly more greatly impaired in terms of their mental quality of 
life and psychological distress, as indicated by Symptom Checklist 90, than 
those without a history of surgery. At the follow-up visit, the differences 
tended to be minimal as well. As compared with those who had no previous 
surgeries, the patients who had undergone surgery were significantly more 
heavily impaired in their physical quality of life despite significant 
improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sciatica demonstrated less abnormality in terms of 
the psychopathologic markers investigated than described in previous studies. 
Nevertheless, the predisposition to somatize influences health-related quality 
of life to a high degree.

Congenital hypoplasia of the lumbosacral process is an uncommon cause of 
recurrent lumbalgia. The 37 cases reported in the literature illustrate the 
complexity of the pathological implications of these anomalies. We report 
another case and our diagnostic methodology. We propose lumbosacral arthrodesis 
which provided complete relief in our patient. This satisfactory outcome has 
been maintained at one year.

A 45-year-old male was admitted because of chest pain, lumbago, and bilateral 
ankle pain. Examination disclosed hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, acquired 
Fanconi syndrome, and abnormalities in distal nephron such as distal renal 
tubular acidosis and renal diabetes insipidus. Further exploration revealed IgA 
kappa multiple myeloma excreting urinary Bence Jones protein (kappa-light 
chain). Renal biopsy revealed thick basement membranes and elec-tron-dense 
crystals in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Immunofluorescent studies 
revealed deposition of kappa-light chain in renal tubular epithelial cells that 
caused the renal tubular damage. Although the osteomalacia was relieved by 
medical treatment, the urinary Bence Jones protein and the renal tubular defects 
were not improved by the chemotherapy for the myeloma. The patient died of 
exacerbation of multiple myeloma at 50 years of age.

The value of magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine to predict low-back 
pain in asymptomatic subjects : a seven-year follow-up study.

BACKGROUND: In 1989, a group of sixty-seven asymptomatic individuals with no 
history of back pain underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine. 
Twenty-one subjects (31%) had an identifiable abnormality of a disc or of the 
spinal canal. In the current study, we investigated whether the findings on the 
scans of the lumbar spine that had been made in 1989 predicted the development 
of low-back pain in these asymptomatic subjects.
METHODS: A questionnaire concerning the development and duration of low-back 
pain over a seven-year period was sent to the sixty-seven asymptomatic 
individuals from the 1989 study. A total of fifty subjects completed and 
returned the questionnaire. A repeat magnetic resonance scan was made for 
thirty-one of these subjects. Two neuroradiologists and one orthopaedic spine 
surgeon interpreted the original and repeat scans in a blinded fashion, 
independent of clinical information. At each disc level, any radiographic 
abnormality, including bulging or degeneration of the disc, was identified. 
Radiographic progression was defined as increasing severity of an abnormality at 
a specific disc level or the involvement of additional levels.
RESULTS: Of the fifty subjects who returned the questionnaire, twenty-nine (58%) 
had no back pain. Low-back pain developed in twenty-one subjects during the 
seven-year study period. The 1989 scans of these subjects demonstrated normal 
findings in twelve, a herniated disc in five, stenosis in three, and moderate 
disc degeneration in one. Eight individuals had radiating leg pain; four of them 
had had normal findings on the original scans, two had had spinal stenosis, one 
had had a disc protrusion, and one had had a disc extrusion. In general, repeat 
magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a greater frequency of disc 
herniation, bulging, degeneration, and spinal stenosis than did the original 
scans.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings on magnetic resonance scans were not predictive of the 
development or duration of low-back pain. Individuals with the longest duration 
of low-back pain did not have the greatest degree of anatomical abnormality on 
the original, 1989 scans. Clinical correlation is essential to determine the 
importance of abnormalities on magnetic resonance images.

Radiologic abnormalities and low back pain in elite skiers.

Ogon M(1), Riedl-Huter C, Sterzinger W, Krismer M, Spratt KF, Wimmer C.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Innsbruck, Austria.

Lumbar radiographs of 120 adolescent elite skiers were evaluated for radiologic 
abnormalities by two independent observers. All athletes had no symptoms before 
the study. Radiographs were taken before enrollment of the students in elite 
level training. To determine the clinical significance of these abnormalities, 
all athletes were observed prospectively during the subsequent 2-year period for 
development of low back pain under high performance training. Anterior end plate 
lesions, Schmorl's nodes, posterior end plate lesions, spondylolysis, scoliosis, 
and spina bifida occulta were found. The depth of anterior end plate lesions 
showed a two-peak distribution, with peaks at 11% and 22% and a valley at 18% 
vertebral body height. The overall low back pain incidence was 12.5%. Students 
with severe anterior lesions (greater than 18% vertebral body height, n = 25) 
had significantly more low back pain (incidence, 32%) than did students without 
severe anterior lesions (incidence, 7.4%). Accordingly, students with severe 
anterior lesions had a significantly higher risk of having low back pain 
develop. Moderate end plate lesions and other abnormalities were not related to 
an increased incidence of low back pain. Adolescent students of elite sports 
with severe lumbar anterior end plate lesions have an increased risk of having 
low back pain develop under high performance training.

An unusual cause of incontinence.

Giles LG(1), Yamada S.

Author information:
(1)National Unit for Multidisciplinary Studies of Spinal Pain, University of 
Queensland, Townsville General Hospital, Queensland.

BACKGROUND: Incontinence is the most common urological symptom of tethered cord 
syndrome and may present as the earliest sign of this condition. The presence of 
unexplained incontinence with spinal anomalies, low back and leg symptoms, 
should raise the suspicion of tethered cord syndrome and lead to a lumbar MRI 
study, even though only subtle neurological abnormalities are found.
OBJECTIVE: This case acts as a timely reminder of the need to be familiar with 
adult tethered cord syndrome so that an appropriate diagnosis is made promptly.
DISCUSSION: The two groups of tethered cord syndrome, group 1 and group 2, are 
briefly defined; this paper discusses the presenting history of a patient in the 
first group.

Clinical and psychological correlates of lumbar motion abnormalities in low back 
disorders.

Center, Farmington, CT 06030, USA.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain (LBP) and low back disorders (LBDs) identify a 
complex constellation of conditions that frustrate both diagnosis and therapy. 
Dynamic quantitative assessment and questionnaire instruments directed toward 
psychosocial and situational variables provide potentially powerful tools for 
determining functional pathology and potentially outcome.
PURPOSE: Our goal was to independently assess clinical correlates of a trunk 
motion measurement device, the lumbar motion monitor (LMM). The reliability of 
the LMM as a clinical test was assessed by comparison with an independent 
medical examination and biobehavioral questionnaires.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: There were three study components. A multispecialty 
physician panel that administered a structured physical examination contributed 
to a clinical correlation case series study. Standardized outcomes and risk 
identification questionnaires were administered to the case population. Finally, 
the LMM was administered in a customary fashion to the same population.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Nineteen subjects were recruited on the basis of criteria that 
included symptoms of chronic recurrent low back pain. This was an employed and 
active, although impaired, population. Eighteen of the subjects were currently 
employed with limited lost work time, but chronic and recurrent pain was a 
common feature.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaire outcome measures were both characterologic and 
situation based. In addition to providing diagnoses, the physician panel was 
also asked to offer certain qualitative assessments, such as rehabilitative 
potential and functional level pertinent to activities of daily living. The 
impact of LMM measures on physician decision making was also assessed. Trunk 
angular measurements were used to assess function of patients with chronic low 
back disorders.
METHODS: Kinematic performance on the LMM was expressed as three probability 
scores. These were the likelihood of abnormality, the "sincerity of effort" 
(exacerbation or aggravation of impairment), and the likelihood of structural 
anatomic disease. These variables were examined against established self-report 
measures of pain and disability.
RESULTS: The LMM and physician panels were in agreement on the presence or 
absence of abnormality. LMM findings tended to be more consistent with clinical 
history than the clinical examination. The LMM results were also generally 
consistent with the self-reported measures of pain and disability: a high 
likelihood of structural disease was associated with depression, somatization, 
poor health perception and diminished vitality.
CONCLUSIONS: The LMM appears to be a useful assessment tool for gauging the 
presence of LBP and LBD. It was accurate in detecting abnormality when 
abnormality was determined by clinical history and physician diagnosis. The 
LMM's differentiation of mechanical low back disease (nonanatomically specific 
disorders) from structurally specific low back disease was not consistent with a 
parallel clinical differentiation. Larger trials in a prospective format and 
studies on a chronically disabled population seem warranted. In an impaired but 
less disabled population, elevated pain and somatization did not appear to 
weaken the effort during testing.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been recognized as a modality of choice in 
the evaluation of the spine. However, morphological abnormalities demonstrated 
by MR imaging do not always reflect low back pain (LBP). MR imaging should be 
interpreted with consideration of full clinical signs, symptoms, and other 
relevant background. At the same time, MR findings potentially relevant to LBP, 
such as morphological abnormalities of the disc, presence or absence of high 
intensity zone, abnormalities of the end plate and adjacent marrow signal, 
degree of nerve root compression, and degeneration of the facet joint, should be 
described without omission.

by MR imaging do not always reflect low back pain (LBP). MR imaging should be 
interpreted with consideration of full clinical signs, symptoms, and other 
relevant background. At the same time, MR findings potentially relevant to LBP, 
such as morphological abnormalities of the disc, presence or absence of high 
intensity zone, abnormalities of the end plate and adjacent marrow signal, 
degree of nerve root compression, and degeneration of the facet joint, should be 
described without omission.

Orleans, USA. spinner.robert@mayo.edu

Diagnosis of piriformis syndrome is difficult and its precise definition is 
highly controversial. In this article, the authors present the case of a patient 
who had clinical features suggestive of piriformis syndrome. During surgery the 
patient was found to have a rare variation in anatomical structures, in which 
the peroneal nerve was displaced by the piriformis muscle. Surgical 
decompression did not alleviate the patient's symptoms.

This study evaluates the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 
diagnosis of lumbosacral nerve root anomalies. Prevalence of anomalous nerve 
roots has been based on anatomic dissection or preoperative neuroradiologic 
investigations. Three hundred seventy-six patients with low back pain and/or 
radicular pain who underwent MRI of the lumbar spine were reviewed. Sixty-five 
cases of nerve root anomalies were found (an incidence of 17.3%) of which 1 case 
of cranial origin, 5 cases of caudal origin, 2 cases of conjoined nerve root, 
and 57 cases of furcal nerve roots (15.1%) were identified. Furcal nerve roots 
were most commonly found at L3 and L4 levels and were classified, according to 
their division, into intra-and extraforaminal. MRI provided accurate information 
on lumbosacral nerve root anomalies.

Cost-effectiveness of screening x-rays at admission to acute rehabilitation 
after joint replacement surgery: a retrospective chart review.

Lee AJ(1), Lim SS, Kong Y, DeLisa JA.

Author information:
(1)Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of performing routine screening 
x-rays for patients on admission to an acute rehabilitation facility, after hip 
or knee replacement surgery, by reviewing the overall incidence of abnormal 
radiographic findings and determining their impact on patient care and outcome.
DESIGN: A retrospective chart review study, in which 592 patients were admitted, 
after hip or knee replacement surgery, to three acute inpatient rehabilitation 
facilities under one system.
RESULTS: Eight of 592 admissions revealed abnormal screening x-rays, for an 
overall incidence of 1.35%. All of the eight abnormal radiologic cases remained 
medically stable throughout their acute rehabilitation stay. The abnormalities 
did not alter the patients' medical management or length of stay. One case, 
which had demonstrated normal admission films, revealed a dislocated hip 
prosthesis on a follow-up x-ray, which was obtained as a result of new onset hip 
pain. The patient was subsequently transferred back to the acute care hospital 
for surgical correction.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found a relatively low incidence of abnormal admission 
x-ray findings; furthermore, the detection of abnormal admission films did not 
alter patient care or outcome. The results suggested that performing routine 
admission radiologic studies on all patients after joint replacement surgery or 
hemiarthroplasty may not be a cost-effective screening tool in rehabilitation.

Assessment of the clinical significance of asymptomatic lower extremity uptake 
abnormality in young athletes.

Drubach LA(1), Connolly LP, D'Hemecourt PA, Treves ST.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, 
USA.

This study was undertaken to evaluate our hypothesis that most asymptomatic 
lower extremity uptake abnormalities are of no clinical consequence and to 
assess whether these findings should affect patient care.
METHODS: One hundred consecutive young athletes referred for bone scintigraphy 
by a sports medicine clinic because of low back pain were evaluated for the 
presence of asymptomatic bone scan abnormalities in the lower extremities. The 
patients were then reexamined by the referring sports medicine physician, who 
had full knowledge of the bone scan results. Scintigraphic findings were 
correlated with the clinical evaluation at the time of scintigraphy and on 
follow-up evaluations ranging from 8 to 14 mo later.
RESULTS: Asymptomatic lower extremity abnormalities were present in 34% of 
patients. There were abnormalities of the feet in 30 patients (focal uptake in 
26 patients, diffuse uptake in 10 patients), the tibia in 13 patients (2 focal 
uptake, 11 diffuse uptake), and the femur in 2 patients (both with diffuse 
uptake). None of the regions of abnormal lower extremity uptake was symptomatic 
at the time of initial evaluation. There was no change in the clinical 
management of any patient because of the scan findings. None of the patients was 
advised to restrict the activity level because of the asymptomatic scan 
findings. None of the regions of scan abnormality became symptomatic on 
follow-up evaluation.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that asymptomatic bone scintigraphic abnormalities 
of the feet, as well as diffuse abnormalities of the tibia, are common in young 
athletes. These findings are most likely of no clinical consequence and do not 
require a change in the activity level. Focal abnormalities of the femur or 
tibia are not commonly seen in asymptomatic young athletes.

Painful Lumbar Disk Derangement: Relevance of Endplate Abnormalities at MR 
Imaging.

Author information:
(1)Departments of Radiology, Orthopaedic University Hospital Balgrist, Zurich, 
Switzerland. Dominik.Weishaupt@dmr.usz.ch

PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive value of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 
of abnormalities of the lumbar intervertebral disks, particularly with adjacent 
endplate changes, to predict symptomatic disk derangement, with discography as 
the standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients aged 28-50 years with chronic low back 
pain and without radicular leg pain underwent prospective clinical examination 
and sagittal T1- and T2-weighted and transverse T2-weighted MR imaging. 
Subsequently, patients underwent lumbar discography with a pain provocation test 
(116 disks). MR images were evaluated for disk degeneration, a 
high-signal-intensity zone, and endplate abnormalities. Results of pain 
provocation at discography were rated independently of the image findings as 
concordant or as nonconcordant or painless. Sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to 
assess the clinical relevance of MR abnormalities.
RESULTS: Normal disks on MR images were generally not painful at provocative 
discography (NPV, 98%). Disk degeneration (sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 59%; 
PPV, 63%) and a high-signal-intensity zone (sensitivity, 27%; specificity, 85%; 
PPV, 56%) were not helpful in the identification of symptomatic disk 
derangement. When only moderate and severe type I and type II endplate 
abnormalities were considered abnormal, all injected disks caused concordant 
pain with provocation (sensitivity, 38%; specificity, 100%; PPV, 100%).
CONCLUSION: Moderate and severe endplate abnormalities appear be useful in the 
prediction of painful disk derangement in patients with symptomatic low back 
pain.

Partial lumbosacral transitional vertebra resection for contralateral 
facetogenic pain.

Brault JS(1), Smith J, Currier BL.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, 
Minnesota 55905, USA.

STUDY DESIGN: Case report of surgically treated mechanical low back pain from 
the facet joint contralateral to a unilateral anomalous lumbosacral articulation 
(Bertolotti's syndrome).
OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and 
management of facet-related low back pain in a 17-year-old cheerleader and its 
successful surgical treatment with resection of a contralateral anomalous 
articulation.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae are common in the 
general population. Bertolotti's syndrome is mechanical low back pain associated 
with these transitional segments. Little is known about the pathophysiology and 
mechanics of these vertebral segments and their propensity to be pain 
generators. Treatment of this syndrome is controversial, and surgical 
intervention has been infrequently reported.
METHOD: A retrospective chart analysis and radiographic review were performed.
RESULTS: Repeated fluoroscopically guided injections implicated a symptomatic 
L6-S1 facet joint contralateral to an anomalous lumbosacral articulation. 
Eventually, a successful surgical outcome was achieved with resection of the 
anomalous articulation.
CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the possibility that mechanical low back 
pain may occur from a facet contralateral to a unilateral anomalous lumbosacral 
articulation, even in a young patient. Although reports of surgical treatment of 
Bertolotti's syndrome are infrequent, resection of the anomalous articulation 
provided excellent results in this patient, presumably because of reduced 
stresses on the symptomatic facet.

Thoracic and lumbar spine in diastrophic dysplasia: a clinical and magnetic 
resonance imaging analysis.

Remes V(1), Tervahartiala P, Poussa M, Peltonen J.

Author information:
(1)Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Central Hospital, 
Finland. ville.remes@helsinki.fi

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study to evaluate the thoracic and lumbar spine in 
patients with diastrophic dysplasia (DD).
OBJECTIVES: To find the causative factors behind the spinal deformities and 
restricted mobility of the spine.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Typical findings in this skeletal dysplasia are 
short-limbed stature, multiple joint contractures, early degeneration of joints, 
and spinal deformities such as cervical kyphosis, scoliosis, and exaggerated 
lumbar lordosis. The pathogenic mechanism of scoliosis is unknown.
METHODS: A physical examination was performed on 88 patients (55 females, 33 
males) with an average age of 31 years (range, 3-56). Magnetic resonance (MR) 
images from T2 to S1 and radiographs were obtained. Degree of scoliosis was 
measured according to Cobb from standing radiographs. The anatomy of the medulla 
and the size of the spinal canal were assessed. The transverse dural tube area 
was measured from L2 to S1. Disc space, degeneration, and protrusions were 
evaluated. Vertebral abnormalities, if any, facet joint degeneration and the 
state of the spinal muscles were also assessed.
RESULTS: Physical examination showed diminished mobility of the spine. Scoliosis 
was noted in 70 patients with an average of 42 degrees (range, 11-188 degrees ). 
The mean transverse area of the dural tube ranged from 94 mm(2) at L2-L3 to 57 
mm(2) at L5-S1. The area was smaller at all levels compared with reference 
values (P < 0.001). One patient had severe thoracic and lumbar spinal stenosis. 
Five patients had compression of neural structures in the lumbar spinal canal in 
MR images, but had no clinical symptoms. All patients exhibited narrowed disc 
heights and a decrease in the signal intensity of discs on T2-weighted images. 
The prevalence of disc protrusions was low; three patients had a prolapse in the 
lumbar spine. Two patients displayed vertebral anomalies. All patients also had 
muscular atrophy and degenerative-like facet joint hypertrophy. The severity of 
these changes increased with age.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal disc structure and rapid degeneration explain the 
diminished decreased mobility of the spine and may be a causative factor in the 
development of scoliosis. Muscular atrophy may be caused by reduced physical 
activity and rigid spinal deformities. The spinal canal is narrowed, but 
symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis is uncommon.

VATER association: is it recognised by rheumatologists?

Erkan D(1), Lam LA, Yazici Y, Magid SK.

Author information:
(1)Division of Rheumatology, Hospital for Special Surgery, Weill Medical College 
of Cornell University, New York, New York, USA. derkan@pol.net

The authors describe an adult patient with history of chronic low back pain and 
recurrent prostatitis, marked limitation of lumbar spine motion and a radiograph 
demonstrating fused lumbar vertebrae, which suggest a diagnosis of 
spondylarthropathy. However, the absence of radiographic evidence of 
sacroilitis, the nature of the vertebral defects and a history of imperforate 
anus pointed towards the diagnosis of VATER association, rather than a 
spondylarthropathy. Although most patients with VATER association are diagnosed 
during infancy, the musculoskeletal anomalies can be overlooked while the 
potentially life-threatening problems are under treatment. These anomalies may 
become evident later in life. Therefore, in a rheumatologic practice, when 
evaluating patients with back pain and vertebral anomalies, one should become 
familiar with the varied manifestations of VATER association.

Spinal anaesthesia (SA) is an important form of anaesthesia in tropical 
countries. It is considered to have few long-term complications or sequelae, 
although this hypothesis has not been proven in a rural tropical setting. In a 
case control study we found SA to he a significant risk factor for lower back 
pain, reflex abnormalities and muscular atrophy and mild impairment of muscle 
power in patients examined between 3 months and 4 years after SA. These 
long-term sequelae need to be confirmed in a larger prospective study employing 
all possible neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques.

[Acute thrombosis of pelvic and leg veins in agenesis of the renal segment of 
the inferior vena cava].

[Article in German]

Kardiologie Ernst-Heydemann-Strasse 6 18055 Rostock, Germany.

A 19-year-old, otherwise asymptomatic man presented to the hospital of 
orthopaedic surgery with acute severe pain like lumbago. Symptomatic treatment 
was performed after extensive orthopaedic diagnostic procedures. On the third 
day after admission he showed clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis with 
painful swelling and livid discoloration of both legs. Colour duplex ultrasound 
revealed complete thrombosis of the leg and pelvic veins bilaterally, but the 
cranial extent was not clear. Contrast-enhanced helical computer tomography of 
the abdomen and the pelvis confirmed deep pelvic vein thrombosis and showed 
extension into the inferior vena cava. Moreover, the study revealed the agenesis 
of the renal segment of the inferior vena cava with collateral flow through 
dilated lumbar veins to enlarged azygous and hemiazygous, through vertebral and 
paravertebral venous plexus. The renals were drained via dilated capsular veins. 
The agenesis of renal vena cava is a very rare anomaly causing acute thrombosis 
of the deep leg and pelvic veins. Other risk factors of thromboembolic disease 
were not found. The patient was treated successfully with systemic thrombolysis. 
Therefore we used ultra-high streptokinase infusion (9 million units over 6 
hours). Colour duplex ultrasound revealed good flow into deep leg and pelvic 
veins after three cycle of lysis. Magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen 
and pelvis was performed to evaluate the successful fibrinolysis with complete 
recanalisation of the pelvic veins and to demonstrate the venous anatomy. 
Permanent oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon is indicated to decrease the 
high rate of recurrent thrombosis. Compression stockings were prescribed. To 
prevent thrombosis, additional risk factors like smoking, immobilization and 
unusual physical activity should be strictly avoided.

Clonazepam open clinical treatment trial for myofascial syndrome associated 
chronic pain.

Fishbain DA(1), Cutler RB, Rosomoff HL, Rosomoff RS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Miami School of Medicine, FL, USA.

OBJECTIVE: A number of case reports and nonplacebo controlled studies have 
documented the efficacy of clonazepam (Klonopin) in the treatment of a number of 
chronic pain syndromes including lancinating and neuropathic/deafferentation 
pain. There are, however, no data on the efficacy of clonazepam for chronic pain 
(CP) associated with myofascial pain syndrome (MFPS). Therefore, we wish to 
report the results of an open clinical treatment trial of clonazepam for CP 
associated with MFPS.
DESIGN: Forty-six patients with chronic pain (PWCP) and a diagnosis of MFPS were 
recruited into a clonazepam pain treatment open clinical trial. At entrance and 
completion of the study the patients completed a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) 
requesting them to rate their pain over the last 24 hours. Clonazepam was 
titrated upwards from 0.5 mg per day, at 0.5 mg increments, every 2 days. These 
patients rated their perceived pain relief daily on a 3-point rating scale: 
none, partial, total. Once a patient claimed partial pain relief clonazepam 
increases were stopped. Patients who complained of intolerable side effects 
before partial pain relief were withdrawn from the study. For a subgroup of 
patients claiming partial pain relief, clonazepam serum levels were determined. 
Because of the reported efficacy of clonazepam for neuropathic/deafferentation 
type of pain, patients with this diagnosis were withdrawn from the partial 
response group. Statistical analyses were performed on this remaining patient 
group with myofascial pain syndrome without a secondary diagnosis of 
neuropathic/deafferentation pain and partially responsive to clonazepam. 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for this group. Drop in pain level from 
entrance to partial response was tested for statistical significance via t test. 
In addition, 17 independent variables such as presence of trigger points, 
presence of burning pain etc, were utilized in a regression analysis, with drop 
in pain level as the dependent variable. A Pearson correlation analysis was 
first performed in order to determine which of the independent variables 
significantly correlated with decrease in pain level. Independent variables 
having a Pearson r of.3687 or greater were selected for the regression 
procedure.
SETTING: Multidisciplinary pain facility.
PATIENTS: Patients with chronic pain with a diagnosis of MFPS and without 
neuropathic/deafferentation pain.
RESULTS: Of the 46 patients entered into the study, 9 were not titrated to 
partial pain relief because of intolerable sedation and 9 had a diagnosis of 
neuropathic/deafferentation pain. For the remaining group (n = 28), mean drop in 
VAS pain level from beginning of the study to partial response was 2.78 (SD = 
1.94). This was statistically significant (t = 5.49, P <.001). Mean clonazepam 
dosage to reach partial response was 2.41 (SD = 1.62) mg/day and the mean dosage 
per kilogram body weight per day was 0.04 (SD = 0.03) mg. Mean clonazepam serum 
level was 30.58 (SD = 24.53) microg/L. Decrease in pain level was associated 
with the presence of the following independent variables: trigger points (r 
=.451); range of motion restriction (r =.653); non anatomical sensory 
abnormalities (r =.370); chronic low back pain (r =.451); and burning pain (r 
=.482). In the regression analysis, restricted range of motion and presence of 
burning pain accounted for 42% and 16% of the variance respectfully.
CONCLUSION: Clonazepam may have an antinociceptive effect for pain associated 
with myofascial pain syndrome.

Abnormalities of the soleus H-reflex in lumbar spondylolisthesis: a possible 
early sign of bilateral S1 root dysfunction.

Using routine electrodiagnostic procedures, the authors searched for physiologic 
evidence of nerve root compromise in patients with chronic mechanical 
perturbation to the lumbar spine. They examined 37 patients with 
spondylolisthesis and various degrees of degenerative changes in the lumbar 
canal. Clinical and neurophysiologic findings were compared with data obtained 
from 36 healthy persons. The soleus H-reflex appeared to be a sensitive 
indicator of sensory fiber compromise at the S1 root level, because changes 
correlated well with the focal sensory signs and preceded clinical and 
electromyographic signs of motor root involvement. When these occurred, the 
clinical findings were consistent with a more severe nerve root deficit and with 
radiographic evidence of neural compression. The greater sensitivity of the 
soleus H-reflex may be related to the pathophysiologic events that occur at the 
lesion site.

Accurate recognition and reporting of spine abnormalities on MRI requires 
knowledge of normal anatomy and its variants. This article deals with common 
normal variants, points out pitfalls which may be sources of errors in 
interpretation and describes imaging artifacts which are essential to be 
recognized and not mistaken for true pathologies.

[Lower pole pedicle in a series of 84 pyelo-ureteral junction syndromes 
surgically treated in children].

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the involvement and consequences of the lower pole 
pedicle (LPP) associated with ureteropelvic junction syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective study in 81 children presenting a total of 84 
ureteropelvic junction syndromes operated consecutively between 1994 and 1998. 
Urinary tract ultrasound and cystography were systematically performed. Renal 
scintigraphy (DTPA or MAG 3) was performed in 80 children. Preoperative 
intravenous urography was performed in 60 children. LPP was considered to be 
present when its participation in the obstruction was confirmed intraoperatively 
(Anderson Hynes technique with uncrossing of the vascular pedicle).
RESULTS: Group I: a LPP was revealed in 24 kidneys (28.5% of cases), 17 left 
kidneys and 7 right kidneys, in 14 boys and 10 girls, with a mean age of 4 years 
(range: 2 months-14 years). Group II: 60 kidneys without LPP (71.5% of cases), 
32 left kidneys and 28 right kidneys, in 40 boys and 17 girls, with a mean age 
of 2 years (range: 1 month-15 years). The most frequent presenting complaint was 
recurrent low back pain in 58% of cases in group I (14/24) and 5% of cases in 
group II (3/60). The mean age at diagnosis was 6 years. Hydronephrosis was 
detected by antenatal ultrasound in 33% of cases in group I (8/24) and in 72% of 
cases in group II (43/60). Kidney function in group I was greater than 40% in 19 
patients, between 20 and 39% in 2 patients and less than 20% in 2 patients. 
These results were not influenced by age at diagnosis and were not significantly 
different from those observed in group II. Renal malrotation was observed in 2 
cases in group I and in 12 cases in group II. Histology of the junction revealed 
nonspecific fibrosis in the same percentage of cases (91%) in the two groups. 
The mean follow-up was 15 months (range: 2 months-5 years). No surgical failure 
was observed.
CONCLUSION: Ureteropelvic junction syndrome associated with a LPP appears to 
present later with recurrent low back pain in older children. It does not worsen 
the functional prognosis of the affected kidney. LPP can be visualized by duplex 
ultrasound. It may act as an inducer of obstruction by aggravating a 
pre-existing abnormality of the ureteropelvic junction. When LPP is associated 
with isolated dilatation of the pyelocaliceal cavities, the risk of subsequent 
decompensation requires closer ultrasound surveillance, until puberty.

A 52-year-old woman complained of lower back pain and gluteal pain in April 
1997, and was found to have anemia, hypercalcemia and renal disorder. In 
September of the same year, she was diagnosed as having IgA-lambda myeloma 
(stage IIIA). VMMD-IFN therapy was started in November, 1997, and this resulted 
in improvement of the M-protein level, and relief of the pain in the lower back 
and gluteal region. A second course of VMMD-IFN therapy was also effective. In 
April 1998, however, the back pain worsened, and in July the patient suffered a 
fall and fractured her left femur. Upon readmission to our hospital, the level 
of M-protein was lower, and high fever, hypercalcemia, renal disorder, elevation 
of the LDH level, anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed. Bone marrow 
examination revealed 30% atypical large-sized CD19-, CD38+, CD56+ myeloma cells 
and chromosomal abnormalities. Although the symptoms were improved temporarily 
after a third course of VMMD therapy, disease aggravation occurred again, and 
extramedullary masses appeared on the head, face and pelvis. VAD therapy was 
performed without effect, and the patient died about 2 months after recurrence. 
This was a comparatively rare case of fulminant multiple myeloma occurring in 
the terminal stage.

Due to a wide range of normal disk space heights at lumbosacral (LS) junction, 
we conducted this study to evaluate how to diagnose degenerative disk disease 
(DDD) of LS junction and how much information we can obtain from plain 
radiography regarding this condition. We retrospectively reviewed lateral LS 
spine films and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in 100 patients presented with 
low back pain. Anterior disk height (ADH) and posterior disk height (PDH) were 
directly measured from plain radiographs. Signs of DDD were recorded from both 
plain radiographs and MR imaging. We found that ADH < 11.3 mm or PDH < 5.5 mm 
indicate DDD at LS junction with 95 per cent confidence interval. When 
spondylolisthesis presented, disks were all degenerated. Endplate sclerosis had 
significant relative risk (p < 0.05) for lateral neural canal stenosis and disk 
herniation. No radiographic finding showed significant relative risk for nerve 
root compression.

A 53-year-old man developed progressive sensory disturbance and weakness in the 
legs, sphincter disturbance, back pain, systemic symptoms, and pancytopenia. 
Electrophysiological tests indicated a widespread lumbosacral polyradiculopathy. 
Spinal magnetic resonance imaging and routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis 
showed minor nonspecific abnormalities. Bone marrow and liver biopsies showed 
hemophagocytosis; and polymerase chain reaction of cerebrospinal fluid, bone 
marrow, and serum suggested active infection with human herpesvirus-6. Autopsy 
revealed that his neurological symptoms resulted from intravascular 
lymphomatosis (angiotropic large cell lymphoma), a rare variant of lymphoma with 
predilection for the nervous system.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study on individuals with asymptomatic lumbar disc 
abnormalities detected in magnetic resonance imaging.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the natural history of asymptomatic disc abnormalities 
in magnetic resonance imaging and to identify predictors of future low back 
pain-related medical consultation and work incapacity.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The natural history of individuals with asymptomatic 
disc herniations has not been well established, but the high rate of lumbar disc 
alterations recently detected in asymptomatic individuals by magnetic resonance 
imaging demands reconsideration of a pathomorphology-based explanation of low 
back pain and sciatica.
METHODS: Forty-six asymptomatic individuals who had a high rate of disc 
herniations (73%) were observed for an average of 5 years (range, 54-72 months). 
Four classes of variables (medical data including magnetic resonance 
imaging-identified disc abnormalities, general psychological factors, physical 
job characteristics, and psychosocial aspects of work) were assessed at baseline 
and follow-up.
RESULTS: Disc herniations and neural compromise did not significantly worsen at 
follow-up, whereas disc degeneration progressed in 17 individuals (41.5%). Minor 
episodes of low back pain occurred in 19 individuals (41.3%), 6 of whom had to 
seek medical treatment and 5 of whom had to stop work temporarily. The 
requirement for low back pain-related medical consultation was predicted with 
high accuracy by listlessness, job satisfaction, and working in shifts (P < 
0.001). Work incapacity was best predicted by physical job characteristics, job 
disaffection, and working in shifts (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Physical job characteristics and psychological aspects of work were 
more powerful than magnetic resonance imaging-identified disc abnormalities in 
predicting the need for low back pain-related medical consultation and the 
resultant work incapacity. However,the conclusions are still preliminary, and 
replication of the findings in larger and more representative study samples is 
needed.

    AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2000 Dec;175(6):1748.

OBJECTIVE: We examined MR imaging findings and determined the clinical 
significance of subchondral bone marrow changes in the lumbar spine of 
holdium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser diskectomy patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the pre- and postoperative MR 
images of 109 patients with recurrent radiculopathy, lower back pain, or both 1 
year after laser diskectomy of 178 disks. From this group of patients, MR images 
were also obtained in 11 patients with subchondral marrow changes 5-7 years 
after surgery. These patients were interviewed regarding residual lower back 
pain. Thirteen asymptomatic laser diskectomy patients also underwent follow-up 
MR imaging within 1 year of surgery.
RESULTS: After surgery, subchondral marrow abnormalities were identified in 41 
of 109 laser diskectomy patients. The remaining 68 patients had no postoperative 
subchondral bone marrow changes. Postoperative subchondral marrow changes were 
not associated with inflammation of the adjacent disk space and did not affect 
surgical outcome. Bone marrow changes decreased in size in the 11 patients 
examined 5-7 years after laser diskectomy, and eight of these patients described 
their lower back pain as improved. In 13 asymptomatic laser diskectomy patients, 
one new subchondral marrow abnormality was identified.
CONCLUSION: Subchondral marrow abnormalities may occur in the vertebral end 
plates after holmium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser diskectomy. However, these 
changes probably do not affect surgical outcomes and appear to resolve over 
time.

OBJECTIVES: To assess treatment options for calculi in horseshoe kidneys and the 
impact of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) on the management of renal 
stones.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From June 1971 to January 1998, 52 patients with horseshoe 
kidneys and calculi received treatment at our Urologic Stone Unit. There were 40 
men (77%) and 12 women (23%). Average patient age was 41 years (range: 10-70 
years). Clinical onset, treatment received and outcome were evaluated 
retrospectively. A successful outcome was defined as a patient without residual 
calculi or with fragments <0.4 cm in size.
RESULTS: Clinical onset was mainly low back pain in 37 patients (71%). 
Eighty-nine stones were treated, i.e. an average of 1.7 treatments per patient. 
Before the ESWL era (May 1987), we performed two heminephrectomies, 16 
pyelolithotomies, 12 pyelolithotomies combined with ureteropyeloplasty and one 
percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Since the advent of ESWL, seven pyelolithotomies 
and three pyelolithotomies combined with ureteropyloplasty have been done. ESWL 
was used to treat 48 calculi. In three cases the patient was placed in the prone 
position due to difficulties in stone focusing. In 37 cases (77%) patients were 
either rendered stone-free or had residual fragments <0.4 cm in size. Urinary 
diversion for obstruction was carried out in two cases (4%).
CONCLUSIONS: At present ESWL is the first-choice treatment for calculi in 
horseshoe kidneys. It involves no significant focusing difficulties and is 
associated with a low incidence of obstructive complications. Open surgery is 
indicated in cases of stone-related pyeloureteral stenosis and in the presence 
of calculi >2-2.5 cm in size.

Positional MR imaging of the lumbar spine: does it demonstrate nerve root 
compromise not visible at conventional MR imaging?

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether positional magnetic resonance (MR) images of the 
lumbar spine demonstrate nerve root compromise not visible on MR images obtained 
with the patient in a supine position (conventional MR images).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with chronic low back pain unresponsive 
to nonsurgical treatment and with disk abnormalities but without compression of 
neural structures were included. Positional MR images were obtained by using an 
open-configuration, 0.5-T MR imager with the patients seated and with flexion 
and extension of their backs. The disk and nerve root were related to the body 
position. Nerve root compression and foraminal size were correlated with the 
patient's symptoms, as assessed with a visual analogue scale.
RESULTS: Nerve root contact without deviation was present in 34 of 152 instances 
in the supine position, in 62 instances in the seated flexion position, and in 
45 instances in the seated extension position. As compared with the supine 
position, in the seated flexion position nerve root deviation decreased from 10 
to eight instances; in the seated extension position, it increased from 10 to 13 
instances. Nerve root compression was seen in one patient in the seated 
extension position. Positional pain score differences were significantly related 
to changes in foraminal size (P =.046) but not to differences in nerve root 
compromise.
CONCLUSION: Positional MR imaging more frequently demonstrates minor neural 
compromise than does conventional MR imaging. Positional pain differences are 
related to position-dependent changes in foraminal size.

(1)Spine Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0042, USA.

Comment in
    Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 2001 May;80(5):400-1.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical electrodiagnostic textbooks instruct that lumbar 
radiculopathies typically have paraspinal abnormalities and that these 
abnormalities should be recorded using a single 0-4+ scale. Recent work 
demonstrates that that the innervation of the paraspinal muscles is segmental, 
not homogenous, and that asymptomatic persons may have reproducible ("1+") 
positive waves or fibrillation potentials.
DESIGN: To assess current use of the 0-4+ scale, a retrospective study of EMG 
scores in persons diagnosed with radiculopathy at a university laboratory was 
performed. No specific paraspinal EMG technique was used. Included were 117 
consecutive, qualified S-1 radiculopathies and 33 L-5 radiculopathies.
RESULTS: When radiculopathy was defined by "more than one limb muscle abnormal," 
paraspinal scores were recorded as 0 to 1+ in 83% of L-5 and 63% of S-1 cases 
(chi2, L-5 vs. S-1, not significant). For more severe radiculopathies (at least 
one limb muscle with a "2+" score), 0-1+ paraspinal scores were recorded in 76% 
of L-5 and 57% of S-1 cases (chi2, not significant). A total of 82% of S-1 
radiculopathies with no overlapping L-5 innervation had 0-1+ scores.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the common use of equivocal paraspinal 
scores in patients whom electromyographers believe have radiculopathies. 
Standardized exploration techniques and a more detailed scoring system for the 
paraspinal muscles may eliminate this discrepancy.

The etiology of transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) after 5% lidocaine spinal 
anesthesia remains undetermined. Previous case reports have shown that patients 
acutely experiencing TNS have no abnormalities on neurologic examination or 
magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of our study was to determine whether 
volunteers with TNS would exhibit abnormalities in spinal nerve 
electrophysiology. Twelve volunteers with no history of back pain or neurologic 
disease underwent baseline electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and 
somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) testing. Then, the volunteers were 
administered 50 mg of 5% hyperbaric lidocaine spinal anesthesia and were placed 
in a low lithotomy position (legs on four pillows). The next day, all volunteers 
underwent follow-up EMG, nerve conduction, and SSEP testing and were questioned 
and examined for the presence of complications including TNS (defined as pain or 
dysthesia in one or both buttocks or legs occurring within 24 h of spinal 
anesthesia). Volunteers who had TNS underwent additional EMG testing 4-6 wk 
later. Five of the 12 volunteers reported TNS. No volunteer had an abnormal EMG, 
nerve conduction study, or SSEP at 24 h follow up, nor were there any changes in 
EMG studies at delayed testing in the five volunteers experiencing TNS. On 
statistical analysis, the right peroneal and the right tibial nerve differed 
significantly for all volunteers from pre- to postspinal testing. When comparing 
pre- and postspinal testing of the TNS and non-TNS volunteers, statistically 
significant changes occurred in the nerve conduction tests of the right peroneal 
and left tibial nerve. There was no difference in measurements of F response, H 
reflex latency, amplitude, or velocity for either leg. Multivariate analysis of 
variance showed no significant difference between TNS and non-TNS volunteers for 
the changes in the nine nerve conduction tests when considered together (P = 
0.4). We conclude that acute TNS after lidocaine spinal anesthesia did not 
result in consistent abnormalities detectable by EMG, nerve conduction studies, 
or SSEP in five volunteers.
IMPLICATIONS: Electrophysiologic testing in volunteers experiencing transient 
neurologic symptoms is not abnormal.

pain.

U.K.

AIM: In the assessment of the lumbar spine by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
changes in the paraspinal muscles are frequently overlooked. In this study, our 
objective was to investigate the relationships between lumbar multifidus (MF) 
muscle atrophy and low back pain (LBP), leg pain and intevertebral disc 
degeneration.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 78 patients (aged 17-72) with LBP presenting 
with back pain with or without associated leg pain was undertaken. Their MR 
images were visually analysed for signs of lumbar MF muscle atrophy, disc 
degeneration and nerve root compression. The clinical history in each case was 
obtained from their case notes and pain drawing charts.
RESULTS: MF muscle atrophy was present in 80% of the patients with LBP. The 
correlation between MF muscle atrophy and leg pain was found to be significant 
(P < 0.01). However, the relationships between muscle atrophy and radiculopathy 
symptoms, nerve root compression, herniated nucleus pulposus and number of 
degenerated discs were statistically not significant.
CONCLUSION: Examination of the paraspinal muscles looking for atrophy of MF 
muscle should be considered when assessing MR images of lumbar spine. This may 
explain the referred leg pain in the absence of other MR abnormalities.

A prototype flexible fixation system for the lumbar spine was subjected to 
tensile testing to failure and cyclic tensile testing in order to determine any 
regions of weakness. The system consisted of a spinous process hook and two 
laminar hooks made of stainless steel (316L). Each laminar hook was attached to 
the spinous process hook by a loop of polyester braid secured by a crimped metal 
sleeve. In five tensile tests, the system failed by irreversible deformation of 
the spinous process hook at 2.5 +/- 0.3 kN (mean +/- standard deviation). In 
three cyclic tests, in which the applied tension varied sinusoidally between 
0.04 and 0.4 kN at a frequency of 5 Hz, failure occurred after less than 400,000 
loading cycles. This occurred as a result of fatigue crack initiation and 
propagation in the spinous process hook. A finite element model showed a stress 
concentration in the region where the crack occurred, which raised the applied 
stress above the tensile fatigue strength of this stainless steel. The spinous 
process hook was redesigned for manufacture in a titanium alloy (Ti-6AI-4V ELI) 
to minimize artefacts in magnetic resonance imaging. Further finite element 
models showed no unacceptable stress concentrations.

Sciatica is most commonly caused by nerve root compression secondary to 
herniated disk. Rarely, it can be due to a lumbosacral vascular malformation. We 
present five cases with such a malformation, presenting as a chronic 
lumboradiculagia. The patients were explored with computed tomography, MRI and 
selective spinal angiography. Polymorphic anatomic and hemodynamic aspect of 
these cases are reported: 1. One vertebral hemangioma with epidural extension; 
2. Three purely epidural malformations: a) one epidural cavernous hemangioma, b) 
one epidural arteriovenous malformation, c) one epidural varix; 3. One 
paravertebral arteriovenous fistula with epidural venous drainage. Diagnosis of 
these rare malformations may be difficult. A multiplanar cross-sectional 
magnetic resonance and computed tomography scan with contrast enhancement can 
show characteristic abnormalities and may assist in recognition these 
malformations. Selective spinal angiography confirms the diagnosis, allows to 
classify the malformation and is required to evaluate endovascular therapeutic 
possibilities.

The clinical and radiographic manifestations of cervical spine involvement in 
psoriatic arthritis remain incompletely described. Only one case-control study 
has been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a case-control study of the clinical and radiographic 
manifestations of cervical spine involvement in psoriatic arthritis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 psoriatic arthritis patients (mean age, 53.3 years 
(21-78); sex ratio, 1; mean disease duration, 80.4 months (12-204); and mean 
Ritchie's index, 9.3 (2-30)) were compared with 30 controls with common low back 
pain (mean age, 53.8 years (21-78)). Each patient underwent a physical 
examination, completed a questionnaire on function, underwent cervical spine 
radiography (anteroposterior and lateral views and views in flexion and 
extension). All radiographs were evaluated by an independent observer.
RESULTS: Patients were more likely than controls to have neck pain (22/30 (73%) 
vs 8/30 (26%) P < 0.001). Among subjects with neck pain, the time pattern was 
more likely to be inflammatory in the patients than in the controls (14/22 vs 
1/8, P < 0.001). Functional impairment and pain severity were significantly 
greater in the patients. On radiographs, facet joint abnormalities (osteophytes, 
joint space loss, sclerosis) were significantly more common (P < 0.01) in the 
patients, particularly at C3-C4 and C4-C5. Also more common in the patients were 
signs of spondylitis (7 vs 0) and of facet joint arthritis (7 vs 2). No subjects 
had syndesmophytes. Three (10%) patients had anterior C1-C2 subluxation with an 
atlas-dens interval greater than 4 mm. Within the patient group, no correlations 
were found between clinical patterns and radiographic findings.
CONCLUSION: Our data confirm that psoriatic arthritis frequently involves the 
cervical spine, with the facet joints being a preferred target, and can cause 
anterior C1-C2 subluxation.

Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: Chronic scrotal pain is a frequent complaint. In many patients with 
scrotal pain, scrotal ultrasound is performed when the physical examination 
reveals no abnormalities. We evaluated the yield of scrotal ultrasound in 
patients with chronic scrotal pain and a normal physical examination.
METHODS: The study involved the findings in 111 patients with scrotal pain 
lasting longer than 2 weeks, in whom physical examinations and urinalyses were 
normal and who underwent ultrasound evaluation. Follow-up data were available.
RESULTS: The median age at first presentation was 37 years. The median duration 
of pain at presentation was 5 months. The pain in the scrotum was localized to 
the right side in 37% of patients, to the left in 41 %, and bilaterally in 22%. 
Eighty-three percent had intermittent complaints, and 17% experienced continuous 
pain. In searching for a cause of the scrotal pain, 65% of patients were found 
to have a relevant medical history, such as regional surgery, infection, trauma, 
and low back pain, and 57% described provocative factors. Scrotal ultrasound 
revealed 12 epididymal cysts less than 0.5 cm and three subclinical varicoceles, 
but no clinically significant abnormalities. After a median follow-up of 12 
months, the pain continued in 70%, although without the development of serious 
scrotal pathologic features.
CONCLUSIONS: Scrotal ultrasound has no diagnostic value in patients with chronic 
scrotal pain in whom the physical examinations and urinalyses are normal. A 
patient's history may suggest an extrascrotal cause of his pain.

Comment in
    J Endovasc Surg. 1999 Nov;6(4):378.

PURPOSE: To describe the endovascular treatment of an aorto-left renal vein 
fistula.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A 77-year-old man with multiple comorbidities presented 
with low back pain, hematuria, cyanosis, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Imaging 
confirmed a 7-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with a contained rupture into the 
left renal vein. Owing to the patient's high surgical risk, a Talent Endoluminal 
Stent-Graft was implanted to satisfactorily exclude the aneurysm. Hemodynamic 
stability and normal renal function were restored; however, continued perfusion 
of the sac prompted an attempt to percutaneously repair the renal vein defect. 
This effort failed, so open laparotomy was necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: Although total endovascular management was not successful in this 
case, the initial use of a minimally invasive approach allowed the patient's 
clinical status to improve and lower the risk of subsequent surgery.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (SDAVF) are rare but 
represent the most frequent spinal arteriovenous malformation. Their clinical 
manifestations are well known, but their management can still be discussed 
between surgery and endovascular treatment. The purpose of this study is to 
emphasize the pre-eminence of surgical management for posterior and 
postero-lateral fistulas, which are the most common location of the 
malformation.
METHODS: We report a consecutive series of 10 patients with SDAVF treated 
between July, 1995 and July, 1997. Results are compared with other series of the 
literature.
RESULTS: Clinical manifestations were not specific and the diagnosis was 
established in most cases only one year after the onset of symptoms, as a 
progressive myelopathy. Low back pain was present in 4 patients, with 
pseudo-radicular pain in the lower limbs suggesting spinal degenerative disease 
in 3 cases. At the time of diagnosis, 8 patients had permanent motor weakness of 
the lower limbs, usually associated with hypesthesia and sphincterial 
dysfunction (7 cases). In all cases, the diagnosis was established using MRI. In 
most cases, the intradural draining spinal veins were also visible on MRI 
images. The location of the SDAVF was always precised by angiography, and was 
located between T5 and L1 in our series. Seven patients were successfully 
operated on, with surgical interruption of the intradural draining vein. Three 
patients underwent an endovascular treatment, but two of them were operated on 
later, as control angiography showed recurrence of the SDAVF. The clinical 
status of patients always improved after treatment, but recovery was incomplete 
in patients with severe and long lasting neurological deficit.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical interruption of the intradural draining vein is a safe and 
effective method of treatment of SDAVF, especially for posterior and 
postero-lateral fistulas. Endovascular treatment is recommended for anterior 
locations of SDAVF.

Multimodal pain management programmes have been used for chronic pain conditions 
such as low back pain or headache for many years with good results. However 
their effectiveness for treating fibromyalgia has only recently been established 
and with respect to long-term outcome the evidence is still not convincing. 
Recent findings, about abnormalities in pain control and neuroendocrine systems, 
help to understand the symptomatology of fibromyalgia and give theoretical 
support for these treatment concepts. They might also explain why secondary 
phenomena like depression, anxiety, deconditioning and disability can make it 
harder to treat the condition at a chronic stage. The ingredients of such 
multimodal programmes are described and evidence for their effectiveness is 
presented.

Department, ON.

OBJECTIVE: To review indications, contraindications, and risks of using magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) in order to help primary care physicians refer patients 
appropriately for MRI, screen for contraindications to using MRI, and educate 
patients about MRI.
QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Recommendations are based on classic textbooks, the 
policies of our MRI group, and a literature search using MEDLINE with the MeSH 
headings magnetic resonance imaging, brain, musculoskeletal, and spine. The 
search was limited to human, English-language, and review articles. Evidence in 
favour of using MRI for imaging the head, spine, and joints is well established. 
For cardiac, abdominal, and pelvic conditions, MRI has been shown useful for 
certain indications, usually to complement other modalities.
MAIN MESSAGE: For demonstrating soft tissue conditions, MRI is better than 
computed tomography (CT), but CT shows bone and acute bleeding better. 
Therefore, patients with trauma or suspected intracranial bleeding should have 
CT. Tumours, congenital abnormalities, vascular structures, and the cervical or 
thoracic spine show better on MRI. Either modality can be used for lower back 
pain. Cardiac, abdominal, and pelvic abnormalities should be imaged with 
ultrasound or CT before MRI. Contraindications for MRI are mainly metallic 
implants or shrapnel, severe claustrophobia, or obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing availability of MRI scanners in Canada, better 
understanding of the indications, contraindications, and risks will be helpful 
for family physicians and their patients.

Confusion surrounding low back pain syndrome may partially be resolved in a 
select small group of patients by instituting a provocative intraarticular 
injection of a combination of a local anesthetic and a steroid. This approach 
enables one to determine whether the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is the site of 
origin of the low back pain syndrome. We carried out a study of 71 computed 
tomography (CT)-guided injections in 58 patients with noninflammatory etiology. 
The injection was confirmatory to the SIJ abnormalities in 64 (90.1%) joints. 
The effect wore off in 2-14 days in 90% of the patients. We conclude that CT 
guidance is the best method of precise needle placement, and thus CT-guided 
anesthetic injection is the most specific confirmatory test for diagnosing the 
SIJ arthritis. In addition, in noninflammatory conditions, the role of 
intraarticular injection is primarily for diagnostic purposes and it has little 
or no therapeutic benefit.

OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of back pain and spinal alignment 
abnormalities in children aged 10 to 14 years; to define subsets of subjects 
with similar clinical profiles; and to identify factors associated with pain in 
the thoracic or lumbar spine.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 972 five- and nine-graders completed a back pain 
questionnaire at school and were examined by a school physician for spinal 
alignment abnormalities and for motion range limitation in the spine and/or 
lower limbs. Multivariate analysis was used to define clinical subsets and to 
identify factors associated with back pain.
RESULTS: The point prevalence of back pain increased with age, from 14.3% in the 
ten-year-olds to 24% in the 14-year-olds. Girls were more likely than boys to 
report back pain, which was usually located in the low back. The prevalence of 
scoliosis increased with age and was higher in the girls. Multivariate analysis 
identified five clinical profiles: no spinal pain; nonserious spinal pain with 
no impact on medical service utilization or physical activities; spinal pain 
unrelated to an injury; injury-related spinal pain not treated by drugs or 
physical therapy; and injury-related spinal pain treated by drugs and physical 
therapy. Several factors associated with spinal pain were identified, with 
variations across the five groups.

Recurrent low back pain and early disc degeneration in the young.

Salminen JJ(1), Erkintalo MO, Pentti J, Oksanen A, Kormano MJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University Hospital of 
Turku, Finland.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective 9-year follow-up study involving randomized matched 
subgroups of 15-year-old schoolchildren with or without low back pain at 
baseline.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term persistence of initially reported 
recurrent low back pain, and to examine the significance of abnormalities found 
in magnetic resonance imaging of lumbar discs in individuals 15 and 18 years of 
age as possible contributors to persistently recurrent low back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In surveys among children and teenagers during the 
past few years, as many as half of all children in a community report a history 
of low back pain. The current results, in accordance with previous findings, 
indicate that there is a subgroup of adolescents with more chronic symptoms 
which, in the authors' opinion, deserves more attention. Disc disease 
accompanying low back pain is a key issue both in research and clinical 
practice. The significance of early degenerative findings in the lumbar discs is 
not known.
METHODS: In the survey of 14-year-olds (n = 1503), a subgroup (7.8%) with 
recurrent low back pain was found. A random sample of individuals with recurrent 
low back pain (n = 40) and an equal number of completely asymptomatic control 
subjects were selected for a comparative study. The selected groups were 
examined by magnetic resonance imaging at 15 and 18 years of age. The 
participation rate of youth at 14, 18, and 23 years of age for all three 
questionnaires was 82% (29 boys and 33 girls). Imaging data were interpreted by 
two blinded radiologists experienced in low-field-strength magnetic resonance 
imaging. In calculations of relative risks, the participants reporting recurrent 
low back pain in all phases of the study were compared with participants who had 
no persistently recurrent pain.
RESULTS: Eleven participants (35%) in the original group with low back pain 
persistently reported recurrent pain. In 15-year-old participants with disc 
degeneration, the relative risk of reporting recurrent low back pain up to the 
age of 23 years was 16 (95% confidence interval 2.2-118) compared with those 
having no disc degeneration. In addition, disc protrusion and Scheuermann-type 
changes at 15 years contributed to the risk of persistently recurrent low back 
pain.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' earlier findings already favored the hypothesis of a 
causal relation between the early evolution of a degenerative process of lower 
lumbar discs and recurrent low back pain in the near future. The current results 
further strengthen this hypothesis, indicating that individuals with disc 
degeneration soon after the phase of rapid physical growth not only have an 
increased risk of recurrent low back pain at this age, but also a long-term risk 
of recurrent pain up to early adulthood.

    Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 2000 Nov 1;25(21):2845-6.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional case-control approach was used to estimate the 
association between low back pain of less than 12 months' duration and pelvic 
asymmetry among 21-50-year-old patients seeking physical therapy services.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the premise that asymmetrical positioning of the 
innominates of the pelvis is a source of low back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No published studies have been conducted to evaluate 
systematically the association between low back pain and pelvic asymmetry in a 
clinic-based sample.
METHODS: Pelvic landmark data were obtained in 144 cases and 138 control 
subjects. The associations of low back pain with levels of pelvic asymmetry were 
estimated by use of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Effect 
modification and confounding of the low back pain-pelvic asymmetry association 
by several factors was assessed and alternative asymmetry measures considered.
RESULTS: Pelvic asymmetry was not positively associated with low back pain in 
any way that seemed clinically meaningful. Asymmetry of posterior superior iliac 
spine landmarks showed some evidence of a weak positive association with low 
back pain.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of meaningful positive association between pelvic 
asymmetry and low back pain, evaluation and treatment strategies based on this 
premise should be questioned.

A retrospective study to assess the results of CT-directed peri-neural root 
infiltration in a cohort of 56 patients with low back pain and sciatica.

Porter DG(1), Valentine AR, Bradford R.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurosurgery, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.

Fifty-six patients with low back pain and sciatica following radiological 
investigation were found to have abnormalities at multiple levels, more than one 
of which could be responsible for the clinical picture or at a single level, 
which correlated poorly with the clinical findings. Thirty-four patients had a 
diagnostic peri-neural root infiltration to clarify whether surgery would be 
appropriate. Evaluation of the technique was by reduction in analgesia. Eighteen 
patients have had surgery, 14 with a successful, two a moderate and two a poor 
outcome. Four patients have been denied and two are awaiting an operation. Ten 
patients referred for a diagnostic procedure deferred surgery in favour of a 
therapeutic course. Of 22 patients referred directly for a therapeutic course, 
15 had a successful, three a moderate and four a poor result. CT-directed 
peri-radicular root infiltration is a useful adjunct in the management of low 
back pain and sciatica.

Brucella spondylitis: an important treatable cause of low backache.

Gokhle YA(1), Bichile LS, Gogate A, Tillu AV, Zamre.

Author information:
(1)Seth GS Medical College, Mumbai.

OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to see if brucella spondylitis existed as 
a cause of backache in Mumbai and to identify the clinical setting in patients 
of backache where brucella serology is indicated.
METHODS: In 18 months (June 1996-Dec. 1997) we performed tube agglutination test 
(TAT) for Brucella melitensis and abortus on 72 patients of low backache from 
Orthopaedics Department of a teritary health centre. All 72 patients satisfied 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to exclude radiologically 
detectable congenital or degenerative cause of backache.
RESULTS: Six out of 72 patients were seropositive for brucellosis. All six 
patients had either history of animal contact or ingestion of raw milk or milk 
product (cheese or paneer). The lumbosacral backache was severe, radiating to 
the legs and straight leg raising test was significantly positive, they had 
marked tenderness on spinous process of lower lumbar vertebrae. Changes of 
brucella spondylitis were present on plain radiogram of lumbosacral spine in 
three patients. Four patients had abnormalities on bone scintigraphy.
CONCLUSION: Low backache of brucella spondylitis closely simulates pain of 
prolapsed intervertebral disc. Serologic testing for brucellosis is an important 
step in management of such patients, especially when history of animal contact 
or raw milk or milk product ingestion is present, as the disease can be 
eminantly treated with antibiotics.

We report two cases, in first cousins, of spinal arteriovenous malformations 
(AVMs) of the perimedullary fistula type and hereditary hemorrhagic 
telangiectasia (HHT). Spinal AVMs are a rare clinical presentation of HHT, but 
can be the first manifestation in a child with this disorder. The importance of 
considering a coexisting disorder of vascular dysplasia, such as HHT, when a 
child presents with a spinal AVM is discussed.

Lumbar pain and fin swimming.

Author information:
(1)II Division of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, 
Bologna, Italy.

BACKGROUND: It was hypothesised that fin swimming have unique physiopathologic 
features in particular concerning low back involvement.
METHODS: Retrospective study.
SETTING: elite competitive fin swimmers.
PARTICIPANTS: 17 males and 14 females aged from 16 to 23 years.
INTERVENTION: piroxicam, sport interruption for a week, proper warming-up and 
wearing suggestions during out-of-water exercises in the symptomatic group. 
Absence of intervention in the asymptomatic one.
MEASURES: anthropometric measures (weight, height, legs length discrepancy), 
isokinetic measures (trunk flexor/extensor ratio) and conventional radiological 
investigation were taken for all subjects.
RESULTS: Low back pain was present in 14 subjects during off season but only 7 
referred discomfort in competitive season. 78.5% of symptomatic subjects showed 
radiological abnormalities while imaging changes were present in 52.9% of the 
asymptomatic group. Flexor/extensor ratio isokinetically evaluated was less than 
one in 6 athletes complaining back discomfort. Non steroid medication, 
physiotherapy, training and wearing cares was suggested. Authors report a pain 
free return to competition in 57% and a partial resolution in 28% of those 
symptomatic cases who were not used to training cares (in particular proper 
"out-of-water" warming up) and wearing precautions (complete wiping and suitable 
thermic clothing after swimming).
CONCLUSIONS: In fin swimming low back pain can be related to the existence of 
environmental and intrinsic factors. In our series no significant difference in 
imaging changes was pointed out among asymptomatic or painful athletes. 
Therefore a cyclic load on the column, in absence of training precautions can 
make spine abnormalities (in particular schisis, facet derangement and pars 
lesion) symptomatic.

The impact of clinical, morphological, psychosocial and work-related factors on 
the outcome of lumbar discectomy.

Schade V(1), Semmer N, Main CJ, Hora J, Boos N.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology, University of Bern, Switzerland.

In a prospective controlled trial on 46 patients undergoing lumbar discectomy, 
three classes of variables (medical data including MRI-identified morphological 
abnormalities, general psychological factors and psychosocial aspects of work) 
were analyzed with regard to their predictive value for the outcome of lumbar 
disc surgery at 2 year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses were used to 
identify the best predictor variables of four different outcome measures (i.e. 
pain relief, reduction of disability in daily activities, return to work and 
surgical outcome). MRI-identified nerve root compromise and social support from 
the spouse were independent predictors of pain relief 2 years after surgery (R2 
= 0.40, P < 0.01). Return to work 2 years after surgery was best predicted by 
depression and occupational mental stress (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). MRI-identified 
extent of herniation and depression were significant predictors of a good 
surgical outcome after lumbar discectomy (R2 = 0.61, P < 0.001). This study has 
demonstrated that the outcome of discectomy is critically dependent on which 
outcome variables are selected and that different sorts of predictor variables 
have a distinct influence on the various outcome variables. Obvious 
morphological alterations (i.e. disc extrusions, nerve root compromise) proved 
to be significant predictors of postoperative pain relief and improvement of 
disability in daily activities justifying a surgical treatment approach in these 
cases. The most important finding of this study was that return to work was not 
influenced by any clinical findings or MR-identified morphological alterations, 
but solely by psychological factors (i.e. depression) and psychological aspects 
of work (i.e. occupational mental stress).

Two lactating women who had complained of back pain developed spontaneous 
vertebral fractures with low bone mineral density (BMD) several months 
postpartum. The back pain and biochemical abnormalities presented as 
hypercalcemia and elevated plasma levels of the parathyroid hormone-related 
protein (PTH-rP) that returned to normal indices with increasing BMD after 
weaning. The increased circulating PTH-rP might contribute to the 
pregnancy-associated osteoporosis in women who probably are already osteopenic.

Predictors of isokinetic back muscle strength in patients with low back pain.

Keller A(1), Johansen JG, Hellesnes J, Brox JI.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physical Medicine, Ullevaal University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

STUDY DESIGN: Testing for trunk muscle strength was performed on 105 patients 
with chronic low back pain.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate prediction of isokinetic back muscle strength in 
patients with low back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The clinical evaluation of patients with chronic low 
back pain often in difficult because of discrepancy between disability and 
impairment. The isokinetic trunk device was developed as a tool for objective 
assessment of back muscle strength. However, the performance of patients depends 
on radiologic abnormalities of the spine, conditions of the back muscles, and 
various psychosocial factors. Studies are warranted that address how these 
variables influence back muscle strength.
METHODS: The patients with chronic low back pain were tested by an isokinetic 
trunk muscle strength test (Cybex TEF, Ronkonkoma, NY). In addition, the 
following variables were recorded: gender, age, body mass index, emotional 
distress, pain on exertion, self-efficacy for pain, degenerative changes of the 
lumbar spine, cross-sectional area, and density of the erector spinae muscles. 
The three latter variables were estimated by computed tomography scans. The sum 
of the total work performed during isokinetic extension strength test was the 
dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis, and anthropometric, 
demographic, psychological, and radiologic factors were independent variables.
RESULTS: Gender, cross-sectional muscle area, and pain on exertion were the most 
powerful predictors of isokinetic back muscle strength. The final regression 
model, which included these variables, could account for approximately 40% of 
the variability in back muscle strength.
CONCLUSION: For assessing the results of an isokinetic trunk muscle strength 
test, cross-sectional muscle area, gender, and pain on exertion should be taken 
into account.

Dai L(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military 
Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.

The correlation between lumbosacral transitional vertebrae and low back pain was 
analyzed in a study of plain radiographs from normal subjects and patients with 
chronic low back pain. Of 184 normal subjects, only 29 (15.8%) had transitional 
vertebrae, while 97 (35.1%) of 276 patients were noted to have transitional 
vertebrae. The difference was highly significant (p < 0.01). The incidence of 
Castellvi type II transitional vertebrae was significantly higher in patients 
with low back pain than in controls (p < 0.01). This study indicates the 
etiologic significance of lumbosacral transitional vertebra in low back pain.

We investigated the prognosis of low-back pain and the association of clinical 
symptoms and anatomic findings among young athletes. Consecutive patients, aged 
between 12 and 18 years, who had low-back pain that had interfered with their 
training for at least 4 weeks were included in the case series. All the patients 
participated in a standardized interview and clinical examination, and plain 
radiographs and magnetic resonance images were also obtained. Most patients also 
participated in technetium bone scan examination. In 15 out of 19 subjects there 
were anatomic abnormalities that corresponded with the location and type of 
clinical symptoms. Twelve subjects had changes in the disk-vertebral end plate 
complex and eight had a positive bone scan indicative of posterior vertebral 
arch stress reaction. Six out of eight boys and two out of 11 girls had stress 
reaction (P = 0.043). Restriction of painful activities was recommended to all 
subjects, restriction of activities and the use of a dynamic low-back brace for 
the first 3 months was recommended to patients with posterior vertebral arch 
stress reaction. The self-reported intensity of low-back pain (scale 0-100) 
among all the patients was 69 +/- 16 (mean +/- SD) at baseline and 18 +/- 21 at 
the 1-year follow-up (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, the reasons for prolonged back 
pain among young athletes are usually established by imaging studies. A 
knowledge of anatomic abnormalities may help in tailoring training programmes 
and avoiding the progression of changes during growth. Simple restriction of 
painful activities usually leads to good recovery.

Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Alkoptonuria is an inherited metabolic disorder which is associated with various 
systemic abnormalities and related to the deposition of homogentisic acid 
pigment in connective tissues. These pigmentary changes are termed "ochronosis". 
We describe two patients with ochronotic arthropathy who presented with 
progressive and advanced degenerative changes in the lumbo-sacral spine. The 
literature, differential diagnosis and management of this rare condition are 
reviewed in this article. Management is usually conservative, but replacement 
surgery may be offered for severely affected major joints.

 L’ochronose est une manifestation musculo-squélettique de l’alkaptonurie dûe à 
un désordre métabolique qui accompagne diverses anomalies systemiques et associé 
au depôt de pigments acides homogénetiques dans les tissues congonctifs. Nous 
decrivons deux cas d’ arthopathie presentant des douleurs progressives et des 
symptômes de dégénerescence avancée de la region lombo-sacrée. Cet article 
inclut la bibliographie, les diagnostics differentiels et le traitement de cette 
maladie rare. La therapie classique est toujours d’ actualité, mais 
l’implantation de prothéses peut être offerte dans des cas d’ atteintes severes

A study in Kerala, India, confirmed the importance of genital hygiene in the 
fight against infections that have a role in the development of cervical 
dysplasia and cancer. Many women cannot afford sanitary pads, while adequate 
facilities for washing after coitus are often unavailable. Health education, 
satisfactory living standards, and the empowerment of women are prerequisites 
for reducing the incidence of cervical dysplasia.

PIP: In India, cancer of the uterine cervix is the most often seen cancer in 
women. There are no organized community-based screening programs, mainly because 
of a lack of resources and a low level of awareness in the population. Findings 
are presented from a 2-year study in Kerala, India, of the role of genital 
hygiene and other sexual and reproductive risk factors in cervical dysplasia. 
3450 female outpatients of mean age 39.5 years attending the Women and 
Children's Hospital, Thycaud, Trivandrum, were interviewed, of whom all but 15 
were married. 68% of women under age 50 years had been sterilized postpartum, 
while 2.3%, 0.3%, and 1.8% of women used barrier contraception, oral 
contraception, and IUDs, respectively. The husbands of 2.3% of the women had 
undergone vasectomy and no contraception was used by 26% of the women. 33% of 
the women presented with vaginal discharge, the most common presenting symptom, 
and lower back pain was experienced by 16%. 70% reported always washing 
themselves after coitus, but only 8% reported using sanitary pads during 
menstruation. 93% of women who used sanitary pads had been educated in high 
schools or colleges. Inflammation was evident in 70% of smears overall; more 
than 80% of younger women and around 50% of older women. The age-specific 
prevalences of cytological abnormalities are shown, while regression analysis 
found increasing age, increasing parity, illiteracy, and poor sexual hygiene to 
be risk factors for cervical dysplasia. The low level of barrier contraception 
means that there is little chance of preventing STDs through the use of such 
methods, and genital tract infection was undoubtedly exacerbated by poor sexual 
hygiene.

An unusual case of a combination of multiple bilateral spondylolyses (L2, 3 and 
4), spondylolisthesis at L3/4, spondyloptosis at L4/5 and sacralization of L5 in 
a teenage female is described. The patient had severely increasing lower back 
pain radiating to the left lower limb. Radiography identified the abnormalities 
and myelography revealed complete obstruction and compression of the thecal sac 
at the L4/5 level. The case was treated surgically by posterior decompression, 
corpectomy and fusion in a three-stage operation. The follow-up was extended to 
2 years with no complications. No similar case has previously been reported.

Lumbar facet joint arthrography with the posterior approach.

Sarazin L(1), Chevrot A, Pessis E, Minoui A, Drape JL, Chemla N, Godefroy D.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France.

Lumbar facet joint (LFJ) arthrography with intraarticular injections of 
long-acting steroids and local anesthetics is routinely used for therapeutic 
purposes in selected patients for relief of low back pain. The procedure may 
also be used for diagnostic reasons to establish the source of such pain. 
However, because direct access to the LFJ space is not always possible owing to 
degenerative changes such as osteophytes, another posterior approach has been 
proposed for LFJ arthrography. With the patient in the prone position, a spinal 
needle is inserted vertically into the inferior recess of an LFJ with 
fluoroscopic guidance and the patient under local anesthesia. To facilitate 
puncture, cushions are placed under the patient's abdomen to flatten normal 
lumbar lordosis, which enlarges the inferior recess of the LFJ. Use of cushions 
also results in a decrease in tissue thickness in the patient, thereby improving 
image quality and decreasing radiation exposure. LFJ arthrography can 
demonstrate the causative role of facet disease in abnormalities responsible for 
low back pain or sciatica and can be performed easily and rapidly with this 
direct posterior approach.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferative response against staphylococcal 
superantigens in patients with psoriasis arthropathy.

Medicine, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan.

It has been recently hypothesized that superantigens play a precipitating or 
aggravating role in psoriasis. Aside from streptococcal infection, 
Staphylococcus aureus can be sometimes detected in the tonsils of patients with 
psoriasis arthropathy (PA), although its significance in the pathogenesis of PA 
is still unknown. These focal infections are thought to be a possible triggering 
factor of the arthralgia, as well as the cutaneous manifestations, in PA. In 
this study, we have investigated the response of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) from patients with PA to staphylococcal superantigens and analyzed 
its association with clinical and laboratory findings. 3H-TdR uptake by PBMC was 
examined after 7 days' culture with concanavalin A (Con A), staphylococcal 
enterotoxin A (SEA), SEB and SEC1. Results showed that there was no significant 
difference in either the unstimulated or Con A-stimulated PBMC response between 
psoriasis vulgaris patients (PASI score < 10) (n = 15), PA patients (n = 11) and 
normal controls (n = 19). Among 11 PA patients, 8 patients responded most 
intensely to SEB, while 2 patients showed the strongest response to SEA, and 
another responded mainly to SEC1. The PBMC response against SEB in patients with 
PA (38,715 719 dpm, stimulation index (SI); 50.2 41.4) (mean SD) was 
significantly higher than that in normal controls (23,708 466 dpm, SI; 30.9 
23.8) (p < 0.05), however, the difference between that of patients with PA and 
psoriasis vulgaris (33,428 467 dpm, SI; 42.8 30.6) did not reach significance. 
In addition, PBMC from psoriatic patients with a short episode of severe, 
disabling lumbago, which occured following sudden onset throat soreness, showed 
a stronger response against SEB (SI; 73.7 39.7), as compared with that of PA 
patients without such an episode (SI; 42.6 18.1). However this difference did 
not reach significance. Several immune abnormalities, including positive 
antinuclear antibodies or rheumatoid factor were observed mainly in the group 
experiencing such an episode of severe lumbago. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that predominant expression of the T cell 
receptor (TCR) Vbeta 17 was commonly detected in both synovial tissues and 
paired peripheral bloods in two cases examined. In one case, Vbeta 12 was 
preferentially expressed, and in another case, Vbeta 10, 15 and 19 were also 
strongly expressed in the infiltrating lymphocytes in the synovial tissues. Our 
data raised the possibility that staphylococcal superantigens may also play an 
exacerbating role in PA.

MR imaging of the lumbar spine: prevalence of intervertebral disk extrusion and 
sequestration, nerve root compression, end plate abnormalities, and 
osteoarthritis of the facet joints in asymptomatic volunteers.

Weishaupt D(1), Zanetti M, Hodler J, Boos N.

Author information:
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Orthopedic University Clinic Balgrist, 
Zurich, Switzerland.

PURPOSE: To identify the magnetic resonance (MR) abnormalities of the lumbar 
spine that have a low prevalence in asymptomatic patients and thus determine the 
findings that are predictive of low back pain in symptomatic patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sagittal T1-weighted and sagittal and axial T2-weighted 
MR images were obtained in 60 asymptomatic volunteers aged 20-50 years. The MR 
images were evaluated with regard to intervertebral disk abnormalities, end 
plate abnormalities, and osteoarthritis of the facet joints by two 
musculoskeletal radiologists independently.
RESULTS: Disk bulging or disk protrusion was found in 42 (14%) and 48 (16%) of 
the intervertebral spaces in 37 (62%) and 40 (67%) subjects, respectively. 
High-signal-intensity zones were found commonly (in 23 [7.7%] and 25 [8.3%] of 
the intervertebral spaces in 19 (32%) and 20 (33%) subjects, respectively). Disk 
extrusions were less common (in 11 [3.7%] and 11 [3.7%] of the intervertebral 
spaces in 11 (18%) and 11 (18%) subjects, respectively). There were no disk 
sequestrations. A nerve root compression in a single intervertebral space was 
diagnosed by one reader. End plate abnormalities were found in two (0.7%) and 
six (1.9%) of the intervertebral spaces in two (3%) and six (10%) subjects, 
respectively. No severe osteoarthritis was diagnosed by either reader.
CONCLUSION: In patients younger than 50 years, disk extrusion and sequestration, 
nerve root compression, end plate abnormalities, and osteoarthritis of the facet 
joints are rare and, therefore, may be predictive of low back pain in 
symptomatic patients.

Chataigner H(1), Onimus M, Polette A.

Author information:

Saint-Jacques, Besançon.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To determine predictive factors allowing to improve the 
results of fusion in low back pain treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fifty six patients were retrospectively reviewed. Average 
age at surgery was 42. In 29 cases, discectomy or nucleolysis had been 
previously performed. All patients were treated by anterior lumbar interbody 
fusion. Functional results were assessed by the Beaujon index, with 
determination of a relative improvement rate. Results were analyzed according to 
clinical symptoms, fused level, previous surgery, association to posterior 
osteosynthesis and MRI changes. MRI changes were classified according to Modic 
types.
RESULTS: The average relative improvement rate was 66 per cent. Pain topography, 
previous surgery, fused level, association with posterior osteosynthesis had not 
statistical effect on the functional result. Inversely, a close relation was 
observed between pre-operative MRI changes and the result of surgery: best 
results were observed in Modic I changes on adjacent vertebral end plates, with 
decreased signal of T1 and increased signal on T2 weighted images, suggesting 
inflammatory changes; poor results were observed in isolated disc degeneration 
without vertebral end-plates changes; poor results were observed in Modic II 
changes with increased signal on both T1 and T2 weighted images, suggesting 
degenerative changes; but among 5 non unions, 3 were observed in Modic II 
changes.
DISCUSSION: The authors identify a lumbar disc dysfunction syndrome 
characterized by mechanical pain, with disc narrowing and anterior condensation 
of the vertebral plates on MRI (Modic I changes). This syndrome should be 
differentiated from common degenerative disc disease, without vertebral plates 
abnormalities (the "black disc" on MRI).
CONCLUSION: Anterior fusion is effective for the treatment of low-back pain due 
to degenerative disc disease, when associated to vertebral plate changes; as the 
pathology is mainly anterior. We prefer an anterior mini-invasive approach; 
furthermore, posterior elements are intact and canal exploration is unnecessary. 
However, an additional posterior osteosynthesis is preferable in Modic type II, 
as non union rate is increased by fatty degenerative involution.

A 32-year-old female presented with about a week's history of dull pain in the 
head and neck pain. On the day of admission, she experienced a sudden onset of 
severe pain, extending from the occipital to the lower back region and 
hypesthesia and paresthesia of the right C8-Th3 dermatome. On admission, she was 
alert but there was a band of hypesthesia and paresthesia at the level of 
C8-Th3. Cervical X-ray, computed tomography scan (CT) and magnetic resonance 
images (MRI) of the head revealed no definite abnormalities. The peripheral 
blood picture was normal, and the bleeding and clotting times were in the normal 
range. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was bloody and the CSF pressure was 220 mm 
H2O. An emergent 4-vessel intracranial angiography disclosed no abnormal 
findings. MRI and myelography revealed an intradural extramedullary lesion 
extending from the Th2 to the Th5 levels, ventral to the spinal cord. A 
T1-weighted MR image showed iso-low intensity and a T2-weighted MR image showed 
low intensity at these lesions. Spinal angiography revealed no abnormal vessels. 
In one month, spinal compression cleared gradually without surgery and her 
clinical symptoms disappeared about 40 days after admission. Spontaneous spinal 
subdural hematoma is uncommon and only 28 cases have been reported. 15 cases 
have been treated with surgical procedure, but spinal compression cleared 
spontaneously in this case. This spontaneous recovery is such a rare event that 
only 3 such cases have been reported in the literature. However, with the 
prevailing MRI, this disease will be detected more frequently in the future.

Although most acute conditions of the spine are benign and self-limited, the 
economic costs and disability resulting from these disorders have reached 
epidemic proportions in industrialized society. Recent scientific research to 
determine the causes of common spinal disorders, long attributed to structural 
abnormalities, have now implicated complex biochemical and neurophysiologic 
processes which may offer insights for future therapy interventions. This 
article reviews the functional and pathologic anatomy and correlates with 
current diagnostic and nonoperative management strategies for common mechanical 
spinal and radicular pain syndromes.

Elliptical modeling of the sagittal lumbar lordosis and segmental rotation 
angles as a method to discriminate between normal and low back pain subjects.

USA.

Clinical significance of lumbar lordosis has not been agreed on. Our purpose is 
to compare lordotic measurements of normal and pain subjects and to test the 
validity of a new anthropometric model of lumbar curvatures. Digitized 
radiographic points (body corners) from standing lateral lumbar radiographs were 
modeled with ellipses in a least-squares method and were used to create 
segmental angles, a global angle at L1-L5, a Cobb angle from T12 to S1, 
Ferguson's sacral base angle, and an angle of pelvic tilt. Fifty normal subjects 
were matched in age, sex, weight, and height with 50 acute pain subjects, 50 
chronic pain subjects, and 24 pain subjects with radiographic abnormalities. Of 
11 angles, 2 distances, and 2 ratios, statistical analysis was significantly 
different across groups for 12 of these measurements, with the alternative 
hypotheses accepted for the other 3 measurements. The lordosis of both normal 
and low back pain subjects can be successfully modeled with a portion 
(approximately 86 degrees) of an ellipse, but with different major and minor 
axis ratios. The normal group's average elliptic lordosis has the smallest 
least-squares error, approximately 1 mm per digitized point, with (minor 
axis)/(major axis) ratio = 0.39, L1-L5 global angle = 40 degrees, and Cobb angle 
= 65 degrees. The chronic and radiographic abnormalities pain groups have an 
elongated ellipse with hypolordosis, reduced L1-L5 global angle = 29.6-35 
degrees, reduced Cobb angle = 57-58 degrees, and elliptic axis ratio = 
0.27-0.30. The acute pain group is hyperlordotic with the largest L1-L5 global 
angle, largest Cobb angle = 70 degrees, largest Ferguson's angle, and largest 
pelvic tilt angle.

The therapeutic impact of lumbar spine MRI on patients with low back and leg 
pain.

Rankine JJ(1), Gill KP, Hutchinson CE, Ross ER, Williamson JB.

Author information:
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Manchester, UK.

The influence of lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the management 
of patients with low back and leg pain, with a clinical diagnosis of neural 
compression, has been investigated by a controlled prospective observational 
study. The clinical features of the patients at the time of request for MRI have 
been compared with the subsequent management in order to define the clinical 
indications for lumbar spine MRI.
METHODS: Clinical history, physical examination findings and tests of functional 
and psychological disability were all recorded at the time of request for MRI. 
Following MRI, patients were assessed without knowledge of the MRI findings and 
a diagnosis and management plan recorded. Immediate access to the MRI report and 
hard copy films was then provided and a revised diagnosis and management plan 
made. The clinical features and MRI findings were compared with the subsequent 
management.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were examined, 65 (90.3%) had leg pain as a 
predominant feature and abnormalities in neurological examination were found in 
31 (43%). Twenty-three of 48 (47.9%) of patients with a pre MRI management plan 
of surgery were changed to conservative management following the MRI. The 
diagnosis altered in 50 % of cases with the largest change in diagnosis 
occurring in 13 patients where MRI did not confirm the clinical impression of 
nerve root compression. Seventeen patients with no abnormality of neurological 
testing were subsequently treated by surgery which included all 12 patients 
treated by spinal fusion.
CONCLUSIONS: The major impact of MRI was to move patients towards conservative 
treatment. A variety of features in the history and physical examination as well 
as MRI findings are predictors for surgical treatment. The variety of diagnoses 
and surgical options available make it difficult to define clear clinical 
guidelines for the use of MRI.

Intervertebral disc herniation is a common cause of radiculopathy and myelopathy 
in adulthood. It is an uncommon tumor mimic. We report on an extradural disc 
associated with an osseous defect ostensibly caused by pressure erosion and 
appearing as a neural tumor. It showed homogeneous enhancement on a 
contrast-enhanced MR examination, leading to an erroneous diagnosis of nerve 
sheath tumor. An attempt has been made to explain the likely mechanism of 
formation accounting for the imaging appearances, along with a review of the 
literature.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence rates of musculoskeletal disorders in a 
rural population of Thailand.
METHODS: Nurses applied the WHO-ILAR COPCORD Core Questionnaire to 2463 rural 
subjects 15 years of age and over. Respondents who had current musculoskeletal 
pain were examined by 2 rheumatologists within one week after the interview 
survey. Radiographic and serologic examinations were carried out when required 
to classify categories of rheumatic disease.
RESULTS: Response rates of the interview survey and examination were 99.7 and 
94.2%, respectively. Musculoskeletal pain ever by interview was found in 36.2% 
of respondents. Of these, 22.7, 12.5, 6.5, and 5% had back, knee, hip region, 
and neck pain, respectively. Four hundred thirty-one cases (17.6%) who had 
musculoskeletal pain within 7 days of the interview were examined by 
rheumatologists, who confirmed 12.8, 5.7, 0.08, and 3.4% had back, knee, hip, 
and neck abnormalities, respectively. Four hundred fifty-eight (18.6%) had past 
musculoskeletal pain. Total disability rate was 3%, comprising 3.3% in women and 
2.6% in men. Treatment rates by self-medication for current and past 
musculoskeletal pain were 60.3% in women, 65.7% in men. Therapy was by physician 
52.1%, paramedics 9.7%, and masseur 6.8%. The rates of disease prevalence were 
osteoarthritis 11.3%, myofascial pain syndrome 6.3%, low back pain 4.0%, 
arthralgia 3.2%, gout 0.16%, rheumatoid arthritis and seronegative 
spondyloarthropathy each 0.12%, and mixed connective tissue disease and 
unclassified autoimmune disease each 0.04%.
CONCLUSION: Back and knee pain caused the greatest burdens of disease, resulting 
mostly from joint degeneration.

Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong.

The following health consequences of vertebral deformity in Hong Kong elderly 
Chinese men and women were studied: the prevalence of back pain, disability due 
to back pain, and low morale. Lateral X-ray films were taken of the thoracic and 
lumbar spine of 796 community-dwelling Chinese subjects (396 men, 400 women) 
(aged 70-79). Subjects with one or more definitely deformed vertebra (reduction 
in vertebral height 3 SD or more below the mean) were classified as definite 
cases, those with one or more mildly deformed vertebra (reduction in vertebral 
height 2-2.99 SD below the mean) as mild cases, and the rest as controls. The 
prevalence and consequences of back pain were measured by a standardized 
questionnaire, and morale was measured by the Geriatric Morale Score. The 
relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of having back pain and 
being depressed were calculated by logistic regression. Classifications included 
16% of men and 30% of women as definite cases, 37% of men and 35% of women as 
mild cases, and 47% of men and 35% of women as controls. The relative risk (RR) 
of back pain was 2.3 (95% CI 1.4-3.9) (P < 0.05) in women with definite 
deformity and 1.5 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) (P > 0.05) in women with mild deformity, as 
compared with controls. Sixty-four percent of all men had back pain. This 
prevalence was much higher than figures obtained in a previous survey on low 
back pain. The prevalence of back pain did not differ by deformity status, but 
more men with vertebral deformity were on analgesic. There was no significant 
association between disability due to back pain and vertebral deformity in 
women. The RR for having a low morale score (of 5 and below) was 2.3 (95% CI 
1.3-4.1) (P < 0. 05) in women with mild deformity; men with vertebral deformity 
did not have a low morale. It was concluded that vertebral deformity was 
associated with significant back pain and psychological morbidity in elderly 
Chinese women. Although men with vertebral deformity did not report more back 
pain, more were on analgesics than controls.

In recent years there has been spectacular progress in the approach to various 
disorders of the spinal column. Owing to improved methods of osteosynthesis 
there is no longer so much need for long periods of postoperative bed rest. Of 
all the scolioses, idiopathic scoliosis is most common. The vast majority of 
these cases are not clinically significant. What is seen in the remaining cases 
if left untreated is a progression in the curvature during growth. Progressive 
idiopathic scoliosis can be effectively treated using conservative methods. 
Screening at school is an important part of this process. If the curvature 
proves progressive and skeletal growth is not complete a brace can be 
prescribed. Use of this strategy and form of treatment can avoid progression of 
the curvature and development of serious deformities. This conservative therapy 
has markedly reduced the need for corrective surgery. Scheuermann's disease is 
characterized by a fixed dorsal thoracic kyphosis. Progressive Scheuermann's 
kyphosis can be effectively treated using a brace. The majority of fractures of 
the vertebral bodies can be treated conservatively. However, serious fractures 
normally require surgical intervention. In the industrialised Western world, low 
back pain is a major health problem and the foremost cause of disability and 
unfitness for work. Low back pain caused by degenerative disease of the spinal 
column should be treated using a multidisciplinary approach. The development of 
advanced operative techniques and osteosynthesis methods has made it possible to 
treat metastases of the spine surgically. The effects of this treatment on the 
quality of life are encouraging.

Low back pain and "computer neck" are frequent complaints during visits to a 
physician. Back and neck pain affects up to 60% of all employees at some time in 
their careers and is personally and financially devastating. Repetitive 
mechanical stress leads to disc degeneration, loss of disc height, and other 
abnormalities. The PT machine, which is controlled and coordinated by onboard 
computer and fiberoptic feedback sensors, is the first biorobotic system that 
alleviates intradiscal pressure and myospasm.

Sustained effect of an intervention to limit ordering of emergency department 
lumbosacral spine films.

NY 10467, USA.

Attempts at modification of test-ordering practices among housestaff demonstrate 
reversion to prior behavior after relaxation of surveillance. To test the 
hypothesis that use of pre-specified criteria for obtaining emergency department 
(ED) lumbosacral spine (LSS) films would reduce LSS utilization, we designed a 
cross-sectional observational study, with 1-year follow-up. The primary endpoint 
was estimate of efficacy, expressed as a proportionate change in LSS films from 
1982 to 1992, adjusted for ED volume. The secondary endpoint was estimate of 
safety of this protocol. We found a 28% proportionate decrease in LSS films from 
1982 to 1992. Among 520 patients with back complaints not meeting criteria for 
films, 4 had serious back pathology on follow-up that may have been detected on 
the index ED visit if LSS films had been ordered. All four were HIV(+), three of 
whom initially denied, then subsequently admitted, to active intravenous drug 
use. We conclude that use of a simple requisition form is associated with a 
quantitatively and statistically significant sustained reduction in utilization 
of ED LSS radiography. This protocol appears to provide a safe, cost-efficient 
means of limiting LSS film ordering by housestaff, with the possible exception 
of HIV(+) individuals. Because the association between HIV and radiographic 
abnormalities may be confounded by intravenous drug use, we cannot determine, on 
the basis of our data, whether HIV(+) status should be considered an independent 
criterion for obtaining LSS films.

Double crush syndrome in lower extremities.

Golovchinsky V(1).

Retrospective analysis of results of electromyography and nerve conduction 
velocity was performed in 169 patients with lower back pain, mostly caused by 
trauma. A total 289 peroneal, 280 posterior tibial and 301 sural nerves were 
included in statistical analysis. Peripheral entrapment of nerves (tarsal tunnel 
syndrome and anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome) were found in 5.3% of patients, 
signs of acute or chronic partial muscle denervation of corresponding muscles of 
lower extremities in 21.8% of patients, and abnormally prolonged F-wave latency 
in 12.5% of patients. Combined partial denervation and abnormally prolonged 
F-wave latency were found in 6.2% of patients, combined partial denervation and 
peripheral entrapment of nerves in 4.4% of patients, combined abnormally 
prolonged F-wave latency and peripheral entrapment of nerves in 2.4% of patients 
and combined partial denervation, abnormally prolonged F-wave latency and 
peripheral entrapment of nerves in 3.5% of patients. Statistical analysis of 
these data showed significantly higher than random overlap of peripheral 
entrapment syndromes and signs of proximal nerve damage of the corresponding 
nerves (partial muscle denervation or abnormalities of F-wave). This higher than 
random coincidence of the two conditions strongly suggests cause-and-effect 
relationship of damage of the proximal stretch of motor nerve fibers and 
development of peripheral entrapment syndromes in the same nerves rather than a 
random coincidence of two independent pathologies. Appreciation of this causal 
relationship is important in the development of comprehensive approach to 
treatment of peripheral entrapment syndromes. In appropriate cases, simultaneous 
treatment of the lower back problem should be considered as well.

The role of surgery in the management of low back pain.

Szpalski M(1), Gunzburg R.

Brussels, Belgium.

The main challenge of surgery in the treatment of low back pain lies with the 
poor knowledge of the aetio-pathogenesis of this symptom. Surgical treatment 
requires the precise diagnosis of a surgically curable lesion. In low back 
disorders this research of a precise source of nociception remains elusive even 
in the presence of radiological abnormalities. Indeed, surgery may not be 
performed to treat a symptom (low back pain), but an objective condition or 
disease. Surgical treatment for low back pain is the subject of many 
controversies, but a certain numbers of attitudes can be (generally) agreed upon 
in a variety of low back disorders: (i) intervertebral disc herniation; (ii) 
degenerative spinal disease; (iii) spinal stenosis; (iv) lytic 
spondylolisthesis. However, there is a wide choice of attitudes, techniques and 
procedures for each of those indications and numerous conflicting result reports 
have been published. This chapter will try to present the best available 
consensus regarding the indications and results of different surgical procedures 
in spinal disorders. Most of all, physicians should bear in mind that, in spine 
surgery perhaps more than in other fields, unreasonable patient (and surgeon) 
expectations will most likely lead to poor outcomes.

What help and what confusion can imaging provide?

Boos N(1), Hodler J.

Low back pain is a very common but benign and, in general, self-limiting disease 
indicating that only a small proportion of patients will require sophisticated 
imaging studies. Recent studies have highlighted the fact that a simple 
relationship of structural abnormalities to low back pain is impossible because 
similar alterations can be found in symptomatic as well as in asymptomatic 
individuals. these findings question our current criteria for the diagnosis of 
low back pain disorders with regard to their discriminative power in 
differentiating diseased and non-diseased individuals. Structural abnormalities 
demonstrated by imaging studies should therefore only be interpreted in the 
light of the clinical findings. This review shows that only a few studies 
contribute to our understanding of the clinical efficacy of imaging studies in 
the evaluation of low back pain disorders. There is an absolute need for 
comprehensive, well conducted studies on the impact of specific imaging 
modalities on diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal disease.

Use of lumbosacral spine radiographs in a level II emergency department.

Author information:
(1)Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University Medical School, St 
Louis, MO 63110, USA.

OBJECTIVE: We studied indications for lumbosacral spine radiographs in an 
emergency department setting.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Clinicians completed a lumbosacral spine request form 
before obtaining lumbosacral radiographs on 482 patients who were examined in a 
level II emergency department. The clinicians detailed the indications for the 
examination, their suspected clinical diagnoses, and the expected effect of the 
lumbosacral spine study on management. In addition, the duration of the 
patients' symptoms was recorded as well as their age and sex. These data were 
compared with the actual radiographic findings as interpreted by board-certified 
musculoskeletal radiologists.
RESULTS: Major indications for lumbosacral radiographs were lower back pain 
(92%) and trauma (36%). Patient expectation and medicolegal concerns, related 
either to insurance documentation or to physician litigation, were cited in 42% 
of cases. A neurologic deficit was present in 88% of patients, and a history of 
neoplasm was elicited in 4%. Strain (56%) and fracture (20%) were the most 
commonly suspected clinical diagnoses. Radiographs showed either normal findings 
or spondylosis in 86% of cases. Fractures, of which 10 were definitely acute, 
were identified in 55 patients. No fracture required decompression. Neoplastic 
involvement was found in seven patients, all of whom had histories of osseous 
metastases. Neurologic deficit, present in 37 patients, did not correlate with 
abnormalities seen on lumbosacral radiographs.
CONCLUSION: As with studies of lumbosacral spine radiographs obtained in 
outpatient settings, our data from a level II emergency department support the 
use of lumbosacral spine radiographs for patients with a history of trauma, even 
if relatively minor, in elderly patients and in patients with lower back pain 
who have a history of neoplasm. Lumbosacral radiographs obtained for an isolated 
complaint of lower back pain generally provide no clinically useful information. 
Similarly, lumbosacral radiographs obtained for patients with isolated 
neurologic abnormalities are unrevealing. Such patients are better examined 
(although not necessarily at the time of emergency department evaluation) with 
techniques such as MR imaging that show soft-tissue lesions.

Self reported health status and magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients 
with low back pain.

The authors present a prospective study of quality of life (SF-36) and MRI 
findings in patients with low back pain (LBP). Disc herniation and nerve root 
compression contribute to LBP and poor quality of life. However, significant 
proportions of asymptomatic subjects have disc herniation and neural compromise. 
Little is known about the influence of disc abnormalities and neural compression 
on quality of life in symptomatic patients. The purpose of this study was to 
assess the relationship between the extent of disc abnormality, neural 
impingement and quality of life. A total of 317 consecutive patients with LBP 
referred for MRI completed an SF-36 health status questionnaire immediately 
before imaging and again 6 months later. Patients were grouped according to the 
most extensive disc abnormality and any neural compromise reported at MRI. The 
relationship between symptoms, radiological signs and SF-36 scores was assessed. 
Eighty percent (255/317) and 65% (205/317) of patients completed the initial and 
6-month SF-36, respectively. Thirty-six percent of patients (115/317) had one or 
more herniated discs and 44% (140/317) had neural impingement. There was little 
relationship between the extent of disc abnormality and quality of life. 
Patients with radiological evidence of neural impingement reported better 
general health (P < 0.01). SF-36 scores improved at 6 months in four dimensions, 
but general health deteriorated (P < 0.01). Patients with neural impingement had 
improved pain scores at 6 months (P < 0.05). The study results showed that the 
pain and dysfunction caused by disc herniation and neural compromise are not 
sufficiently distinct from other causes of back pain to be distinguished by the 
SF-36. Whilst neural compromise may be the best radiological feature 
distinguishing patients who may benefit from intervention, it cannot predict 
quality of life deficits in the diffuse group of patients with LBP.

Middlesex, UK.

This study aimed to identify the morphological abnormalities of the 
intervertebral disc, as demonstrated by lumbar discography, that are associated 
with pain radiation to the hip, groin, buttock or lower limb. We carried out a 
retrospective review of 99 consecutive lumbar discogram reports. The association 
of disc degeneration, annular tears (partial or full thickness) and the level of 
disc injected was determined with respect to the presence and pattern of 
radiating pain. A total of 260 discs were injected, of which 179 were considered 
abnormal. Posterior annular tears were demonstrated in 84 discs, anterior 
annular tears in 15 discs and 45 discs had both anterior and posterior tears. A 
significant association was identified between isolated posterior tears and the 
production of concordant radiating pain (P = 0.0041). No difference was 
identified between partial thickness posterior tears and full thickness 
posterior tears associated with leak of contrast medium, with regard to 
radiating pain. Similarly, there was no significant association between disc 
level injected and the pattern of pain radiation. The results indicate that pain 
experienced in the buttock, hip, groin or lower limb can arise from the 
posterior annulus of the intervertebral disc without direct involvement of the 
nerve root.

back pain.

Among adults, low back pain (LBP) persisting for more than 3 months is a common 
complaint. A variety of imaging modalities including bone scintigraphy have been 
recommended as appropriate for the investigation of chronic LBP, even when there 
is no reason to suspect that the pain is due to tumour, infection or 
inflammatory arthritis. In this chronic LBP population, the diagnostic benefit 
of bone SPET, together with planar flow study, blood pool and delayed 
three-phase imaging, was assessed, Altogether, 2108 consecutive adult patients 
were entered into the chronic LBP bone scintigraphy database. Retrospective 
exclusion of patients with a history of tumour, infection or inflammatory 
arthritis reduced the population to 1390, of whom 916 underwent a lumbosacral 
spine flow study and blood pool imaging in addition to planar and SPET bone 
scintigraphy. The diagnostic benefit of these imaging studies was tabulated and 
compared. In addition, a retrospective chart review of the patients with renal 
and other soft tissue abnormalities identified by a flow study and blood pool 
imaging was undertaken with a view to documenting any changes in treatment 
planning over the 6 months following the nuclear medicine studies. Of the 
lumbosacral spine abnormalities, 44.1% were seen equally well on planar and SPET 
images, 24.0% better on SPET, 31.4% only seen on SPET, and 0.4% only seen on 
planar imaging. The distribution of abnormalities identified on SPET images in 
the lumbar spine was divided between vertebral bodies (36.1%), lamina or 
pedicles (which included frequent sites of increased uptake in the articular 
facets and pars interarticularis) (53.8%), spinous processes (8.7%) and 
transverse processes (1.3%). For the flow study and blood pool imaging, there 
was a 16.7% rate of positive studies. However, there were no documented changes 
in treatment planning because of these positive findings. In conclusion, when 
used to examine adult patients with chronic LBP, SPET detects significantly more 
scintigraphic abnormalities than planar imaging. The addition of a flow study 
and blood pool imaging as part of these LBP examinations results in a 
significant benefit. However, the clinical utility of such flow study and blood 
pool imaging studies cannot be confirmed.

Autosomal dominant pure spastic paraplegia: a clinical, paraclinical, and

OBJECTIVES: At least three clinically indistinguishable but genetically 
different types of autosomal dominant pure spastic paraplegia (ADPSP) have been 
described. In this study the clinical, genetic, neurophysiological, and MRI 
characteristics of ADPSP were investigated.
METHODS: Sixty three at risk members from five families were clinically 
evaluated. A diagnostic index was constructed for the study. Microsatellite 
genotypes were determined for chromosomes 2p, 14q, and 15q markers and 
multipoint linkage analyses were performed. Central motor conduction time 
studies (CMCT), somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) measurement, and MRI of 
the brain and the total spinal cord were carried out in 16 patients from four 
families.
RESULTS: The clinical core features of ADPSP were homogeneously expressed in all 
patients but some features were only found in some families and not in all the 
patients within the family. In two families non-progressive "congenital" ADPSP 
was seen in some affected members whereas adult onset progressive ADPSP was 
present in other affected family members. As a late symptom not previously 
described low backache was reported by 47%. Age at onset varied widely and there 
was a tendency for it to decline in successive generations in the families, 
suggesting anticipation. Genetic linkage analysis confined the ADPSP locus to 
chromosome 2p21-p24 in the five families. The lod scores obtained by multipoint 
linkage analysis were positive with a combined maximum lod score of Z=8.60. The 
neurophysiological studies only showed minor and insignificant prolongation of 
the central motor conduction time and further that peripheral conduction and 
integrity of the dorsal columns were mostly normal. Brain and the total spinal 
cord MRI did not disclose any significant abnormalities compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: ADPSP linked to chromosome 2p21-p24 is a phenotypic heterogeneous 
disorder characterised by both interfamilial and intrafamilial variation. In 
some families the disease may be "pure" but the existence of "pure plus" 
families is suggested in others. The neurophysiological and neuroimaging 
investigations did not show any major abnormalities.

The value of provocative facet blocking as a predictor of success in lumbar 
spine fusion.

Lovely TJ(1), Rastogi P.

Author information:

Medicine, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.

Studies attempting to correlate facet blocking with successful relief of pain 
after fusion have reached unfavorable results. These studies, however, did so in 
a retrospective fashion, and facet blocking was not the sole criterion by which 
surgical candidates were chosen. The current study is the first to use facet 
blocking in a prospective fashion and as the definitive criterion by which 
patients were chosen. Ninety-one patients with chronic low back pain who 
responded to bracing underwent 197 facet blocks. Twenty-eight patients who had > 
70% relief of their pain for >6 h on three separate occasions were surgical 
candidates and underwent fusion along with two others with mechanical 
abnormalities but negative blocks. Pre- and postoperative Prolo (Prolo DJ, 
Oklund SA, Butcher M: Toward uniformity in evaluating results of lumbar spine 
operations. A paradigm applied to posterior lumbar interbody fusions. Spine 
11:601-606, 1986) outcome scores were assigned and the patients underwent 
self-assessment. Twenty-three of 30 patients had successful fusion. Nineteen of 
23 described 90% relief, 3 patients had 50-90% partial relief, and 1 failed by 
self-assessment. A preoperative mean Prolo score of 3.95 (range 2-7) improved to 
7.7 (range 3-10) with fusion. Provocative facet blocking can be used to 
successfully predict outcome in patients undergoing arthrodesis for chronic low 
back pain.

Fibre type characteristics of the lumbar paraspinal muscles in normal healthy 
subjects and in patients with low back pain.

A knowledge of the alteration in the fibre type profile of paraspinal muscle 
associated with low back pain is essential for the design of successful 
rehabilitation programmes. In attempting to compare the muscles of patients with 
low back pain with those of controls, few previous studies have considered 
factors such as gender, age, and size of the subjects, each of which can 
potentially confound interpretation of the results. We obtained samples of 
lumbar paraspinal muscle during spinal surgery from 21 patients with low back 
pain and, using the percutaneous biopsy technique, from 21 control volunteers 
matched for gender, age, and body mass. The samples were subject to routine 
histochemical analysis to determine characteristics of muscle fibre type. 
Compared with controls, the muscle of the patients had a significantly higher 
proportion of type-IIB (fast-twitch glycolytic) fibres than type-I (slow 
oxidative) fibres. The mean size of a given fibre type did not differ between 
the patients and the controls. Consequently, the relative area of the muscle 
occupied by type-IIB fibres was higher and that by type-I fibres was lower in 
the patients. The patients had a greater number of muscle samples with more than 
1% type-IIC fibres, and abnormalities that could be described as pathological 
were more marked in the patients than in the controls. In conclusion, the 
paraspinal muscles of patients who have low back pain display a more glycolytic 
(faster) profile; this can be expected to render them less resistant to fatigue.

(1)School of Health Sciences, Ohio University, Athens, USA.

We conducted this study to address concerns regarding a perceived increase in 
bronchitis, skin rashes, and diarrhea and long term health effects in workers at 
two Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) processing plants. We abstracted medical records 
to assess symptom occurrence, and to identify spirometry and lab abnormalities. 
Overall FEV1 and FVC showed no decrease over time for workers with more than 
five years of exposure. The primary self reported symptoms were low back pain 
and headaches followed by skin rashes, colds, 'flu', hay fever and ear problems. 
Conclusions from this analysis are limited by lack of standardized protocols or 
a control group. However, results from this analysis pointed out potential 
occupational health problems among RDF workers for future epidemiological and 
environmental studies.

A 26-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for lumbago on November 29, 
1995. The white blood cell count was 6,500/microliter with 26.5% myeloblasts and 
the bone marrow was hyperplastic due to myeloblasts. Myeloblasts were negative 
for myeloperoxidase and positive for alpha-naphthyl butylate esterase, CD11a 
(89%), CD11b (38%), CD11c (92%), CD33 (91%) and HLA-DR (58%). Chromosomal 
abnormalities were recognized: 46, XX, t(9;11) (p22;q23), 45, XX, -7, t(9;11) 
(p22;q23) and 47, XX, +19, t(9;11) (p22;q23). Acute myeloblastic leukemia (M5a) 
was diagnosed. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was also present. The 
patient received induction therapy and achieved remission on January 9, 1996, 
but myeloblasts increased to 3.6% in bone marrow despite consolidation therapy. 
Low doses of cytarabine (AraC) and etoposide were instituted on March 7, 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was started on March 15, and 
pronounced skin infiltration developed on March 18. The patient received 
reinduction therapy from April 16 and administration of G-CSF was combined for 2 
days, and a marked increment of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood was 
observed. After discontinuation of G-CSF, myeloblasts decreased and skin 
infiltration disappeared. However, the patient died of cerebral infiltration on 
June 30. The response of myeloblasts to G-CSF by in vitro liquid culture was 
noteworthy. The present case stresses the requirement for great caution to be 
exercised in the use of G-CSF in patients receiving low dose AraC.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the point prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints and 
rheumatic diseases in a Filipino urban community.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional 2 phase survey was conducted in an urban 
community in Metropolitan manila. Phase I (screening) used face-to-face 
interviews, while phase II (examination) involved case identification of the 
rheumatic diseases. We sampled 670 households (3065 adults) using a multistage 
cluster sampling method. A pilot study was conducted to pretest the 
questionnaire for cross-cultural adaptation and validation, field procedures, 
sampling design, and data management plan. Standardized translated COPCORD 
questionnaires (blind translation and blind back-translation) were administered 
by trained interviewers. Two weeks after Phase I, Phase II was conducted at 
local health centers. The COPCORD questionnaire screened the number of cases 
with musculoskeletal complaints. Identification of cases with rheumatic disease 
was based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.
RESULTS: Respondents completed 3006 questionnaires (phase I response rate 98%). 
Of these 489 respondents had musculoskeletal complaints. Functional disability 
was reported in 25% among these respondents. We examined 353 (phase II response 
rate 72%), revealing 294 with rheumatic conditions. In 26 persons there were no 
abnormalities, while 32 had nonrheumatic conditions at examination. The most 
common rheumatic diseases were osteoarthritis (OA) (n = 124) and soft tissue 
rheumatism (n = 115).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints was 16.3% (95% CI 
8.6-24.0) of the adult population in a FIlipino urban community. The total 
prevalence of rheumatic disease is 9.8% (95% CI 8.2-11.4). The prevalence of OA 
was 4.1% (95% CI 3.3-4.9) and soft tissue rheumatism 3.8% (95% CI 2.9-4.8). The 
prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, 0.17% (95% CI 0-9.36), was notably low 
compared to the prevalence in other developing countries.

Magnetic resonance imaging and axial involvement in spondylarthropathies. 
Delineation of the spinal entheses.

We used magnetic resonance imaging in a prospective cross-sectional study to 
evaluate the components of axial involvement in spondylarthropathies, to 
determine whether the entire intervertebral disk is an enthesis and to gauge how 
useful this imaging technique is in detecting enthesitis of the spine. 
Thirty-one patients with spondylarthropathies and 14 controls with mechanical 
spinal disease were included. Images of the thoracic and lumbar spine were 
obtained using plain radiography, radionuclide bone scanning, and magnetic 
resonance imaging (sagittal sections, T1-weighted sequences before and after 
gadolinium injection and fat saturation and T2-weighted sequences). Magnetic 
resonance imaging signal abnormalities reflected inflammation and 
hypervascularization of the subchondral bone underlying the affected entheses 
(low signal enhancing after gadolinium and fat saturation on T1 images, high 
signal on T2 images). These abnormalities were often visible early in the 
disease process, at a time when there were not yet any clinical manifestations 
or radiographic or bone scan changes. In addition to showing involvement of the 
classic spinal entheses, magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated evidence 
of inflammation and hypervascularization of the central part of the vertebral 
endplates and intervertebral disks, confirming that the center of the disk is an 
enthesis and that inflammatory enthesitis is the mechanism underlying at least 
some cases of discitis seen in patients with spondylarthropathies.

Comment in
    Am J Orthop (Belle Mead NJ). 1998 Jan;27(1):20.

Simple and reliable diagnostic aids need to be available for clinicians to 
consider sacroiliac joint dysfunction in the differential diagnosis of low back 
pain. The Fortin finger test was used as a means to identify patients with low 
back pain and sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Provocation-positive sacroiliac 
joint injections were used to ratify or refute the applicability of this new 
clinical sign for identification of patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction. 
Sixteen subjects were chosen from 54 consecutive patients by using the Fortin 
finger test. All 16 patients subsequently had provocation-positive joint 
injections validating sacroiliac joint abnormalities. A subset of 10 individuals 
underwent additional evaluation to exclude the possibility of confounding 
discogenic or posterior joint pain sources. All 10 patients had no indication of 
either discogenic or zygapophyseal joint pain generators. These results indicate 
that positive findings of the Fortin finger test, a simple diagnostic measure, 
successfully identifies patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction.

Congenital lumbosacral lipomas.

Congenital lumbosacral lipomas can be responsible for progressive defects. The 
general feeling is that tethering of roots, filum, or cord probably explains 
this evolution, and that untethering of these structures could prevent late 
deterioration. Like the vast majority of neurosurgeons, we too have routinely 
and systematically operated on lumbosacral lipomas, even in the absence of 
neurological deficits. This policy stemmed from our belief that spontaneous 
neurological deterioration was frequent, recovery from preoperative deficits 
rare, and surgery both efficient and benign in nature. After 22 years of 
experience, we felt that it was necessary to review our series of 291 lipomas 
(38 lipomas of the filum and 253 of the conus) operated on from 1972 to 1994. To 
reassess the value of prophylactic surgery, we attempted an accurate evaluation 
of (1) the risk of pathology, (2) the risks involved in surgery, (3) the 
postoperative outcome with respect to preoperative deficits, and (4) the 
postoperative outcome in asymptomatic patients at 1 year and at maximum 
follow-up. Special attention was paid to 93 patients whose postoperative 
follow-up was more than 5 years (average 8.7, median 8, range 5-23 years). Of 
these 93 patients, 39 were asymptomatic preoperatively (7 with lipoma of the 
filum and 32 with lipoma of the conus). Lipomas of the filum and of the conus 
are entirely different lesions and were studied separately. In 6 cases prenatal 
diagnosis had been possible. The mean age at surgery was 6.4 years. Low back 
skin stigmata were present in 89.4% of cases. Preoperative neurological deficits 
existed in 57% of the patients and were congenital in 22%. Clinical signs and 
symptoms recorded were pain in 13.3% of the patients and/or neurological 
deficits affecting sphincter (52%), motor (27.6%) and sensory (22.4%) functions. 
Deficits were progressive in 22.4% of cases, slowly progressive in 58.8% of 
these and rapidly progressive in the remaining 41.2%. In 36 patients (13.2%) the 
lipomas were seen to grow either subcutaneously or intraspinally. Among these 
patients, 21 were infants, 2 were obese adolescents, and 10 were pregnant women. 
The metabolism of the fat within the lipomas was studied in 11 patients and 
found to be similar to that at other sites. Lipomas were associated with various 
other malformations, either intra- or extraspinal. These associated anomalies 
were rare in the case of lipomatous filum (5.2%) but frequent with lipomas of 
the conus, except for intracranial malformations (3.6%). Therapeutic objectives 
were spinal cord untethering and decompression, sparing of functional neural 
tissue and prevention of retethering. Procedures used to achieve these goals 
were subtotal removal of the lipoma, intraoperative monitoring, duroplasty, and 
sometimes closure of the placode. Histologically, lipomas consisted of normal 
mature fat. However, 77% of them also included a wide variety of other tissues, 
originating from ectoderm, mesoderm, or entoderm. This indicates that lipomas 
are either simple or complex teratomas. The results of the study are as follows. 
(1) Surgery was easy and safe when performed for treatment of lipomas of the 
filum (no complications), but difficult and hazardous in the case of lipomas of 
the conus (20% local, 3.9% neurological complications). (2) All types of deficit 
could be improved by surgery, which was beneficial in all cases of lipoma of the 
filum and 50% of cases of lipoma of the conus. (3) In asymptomatic patients 
long-term surgical results depended on the anatomical type of the lipoma. They 
were excellent in lipomas of the filum. In lipomas of the conus they were good 
in the short term but eroded with time. At more than 5 years of follow-up only 
53.1% of the patients were still free of symptoms. (4) Reoperations were 
performed in 16 patients (5.5%), 5 (31.2%) of whom improved postoperatively, 
while in 7 (43.7%) progression stopped, in 3 (18.7%) deterioration continued and 
in 1 (6.2%) the condition was wor

Transitional vertebrae is a controversial problem in occupational health and in 
forensic medicine, in view of its prognostic value and especially because of the 
implications of law 626/94 which requires a worker assessment for manual 
handling tasks. The purpose of this review was to assess the relationship 
between transitional vertebrae and low back pain. Data sources comprised 
computer-aided search of published studies on Medline and Embase. There were 
seven studies evaluating the prevalence of the abnormality, the relationship 
with low back pain and the different aspects of spinal degeneration. Only two 
studies indicated a positive relationship with low back pain. Four studies 
reported absence of any prognostic value of this vertebral abnormality. One 
study examined a twenty year old population: even if it did not show a 
relationship with a higher incidence of disc degeneration with MRI, we did not 
include it in our review because of the young age of the samples. It is 
concluded that present knowledge does not reveal any correlation between 
transitional vertebrae and low back pain. Further studies are needed to support 
any conclusion about this important issue.

A review of diagnostic ultrasound of the spine and soft tissue.

Rhodes DW(1), Bishop PA.

Author information:
(1)University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa 35401, USA.

BACKGROUND: Current medical applications for diagnostic ultrasound are numerous. 
The technology is attractive because of its ease of use, noninvasive nature and 
low cost. Recent technological advances have improved ultrasound images of 
spine-related soft tissues.
OBJECTIVE: To examine and summarize the spine-related diagnostic ultrasound 
literature to help aid in understanding its possible applications.
DATA SOURCES: This literature search was part of a larger search in which 
several hundred musculoskeletal diagnostic ultrasound articles were collected. 
MEDLINE from 1970 to present was searched electronically. Chiropractic Research 
Archives Collection (Vol. I-IV) were inspected manually. Bibliographies and 
references from studies obtained were examined thoroughly for additional 
references.
DATA SYNTHESIS: All articles related to diagnostic ultrasound and its spinal 
applications were collected and reviewed, except those focusing on 
intraoperative spinal ultrasound in neurosurgery.
RESULTS: Ultrasound has long been used to measure the spinal canal, detect cord 
abnormalities and examine soft tissue abnormalities. Recently, it has been used 
to quantify scoliotic curves, measure multifidus muscle size and image sciatic 
nerve lesions.
CONCLUSION: Several well-documented applications of spine-related diagnostic 
ultrasound, along with many new possible applications, make this technology 
important to any clinician interested in noninvasive diagnostic applications for 
the spine and soft tissue.

Autotransplantation as an effective therapy for the loin pain-hematuria 
syndrome: case reports and a review of the literature.

Spitz A(1), Huffman JL, Mendez R.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA.

PURPOSE: The loin pain-hematuria syndrome is a well recognized but poorly 
understood clinical condition in which patients have progressive loin pain 
accompanied by hematuria but they maintain stable renal function. We present 2 
cases effectively treated with renal autotransplantation, as well as a review of 
the literature, and a coherent algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of this 
condition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical literature concerning the loin pain-hematuria 
syndrome was reviewed. In 1994 we performed renal autotransplantation on 2 
patients with the loin pain-hematuria syndrome at our institution.
RESULTS: Extensive urological evaluation revealed no obvious underlying 
abnormalities in patients with the loin pain-hematuria syndrome. Theories for 
the pathogenesis of this condition range from thrombotic phenomena to autoimmune 
processes. Treatment efforts have been directed primarily towards pain 
management. Narcotic dependence becomes progressive as the pain becomes 
debilitating. In extreme cases nephrectomy is performed despite normal renal 
function. Several invasive methods of nerve block and enervation provide only 
temporary relief. Renal autotransplantation provided lasting cessation of loin 
pain in both of our patients with followup of 1.5 and 2.5 years, and this 
intervention has been shown to provide the most durable pain relief in other 
series.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal autotransplantation provides the most durable, nonnarcotic, 
nephron sparing relief for patients with the loin pain-hematuria syndrome. 
Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the pathophysiology of this 
debilitating condition.

[Transcutaneous radiofrequency destruction of the articular nerves in treating 
low back pains].

[Article in Russian]

Akatov OV, Dreval' ON, Kononov IuN, Rynkov IP.

Lumbar pain is a most common suffering which frequently becomes chronic. In the 
mechanical low back syndrome caused by an abnormality in the intervertebral 
joints, lumbar pain may be rather easily differentiated from pain induced by to 
spinal root compression due to discal hernia or intervertebral foramen stenosis. 
The absence of benefits from conservative treatment of lumbar pain caused by 
intervertebral joint abnormalities is an indication for the highly effective and 
low-traumatic surgical technique transcutaneous radiofrequency destruction of 
intervertebral facette nerves. The technique yields good results in small 
displacements of the lumbar vertebra which cannot undergo orthopedic 
interventions, as well as in severe vertebral deformities which cause a higher 
load on the intervertebral joints.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, University of Maryland Medical System, Baltimore 
21201, USA.

This article describes the scintigraphic appearance of both a symptomatic and 
asymptomatic retroisthmic cleft in two athletes with low back pain. This lesion, 
which involves the lamina, is the least common of the neural arch defects of 
which spondylolysis is the most common. The anatomy of the lesion is discussed 
and illustrated. The literature about the possible cause of these lesions is 
reviewed. The report emphasizes the valuable role of radionuclide bone imaging 
in patients who have pain of potentially osseous origin, and who have a lesion 
of uncertain physiologic significance seen on an anatomic study such as a plain 
x-ray, CT scan, or MRI.

[Are low back pain and radiological changes during puberty risk factors for low 
back pain in adult age? A 25-year prospective cohort study of 640 school 
children].

[Article in Danish]

Harreby MS, Neergaard K, Hesselsøe G, Kjer J.

Recent reports have stated that low back pain (LBP) among children is a common 
problem comparable with that in adults. This 25-year prospective cohort study 
confirms that 11% of the cohort have had a history of LBP in adolescence with an 
84% lifetime prevalence of LBP in these subjects as adults compared with 70% in 
the rest of the cohort. LBP was associated with increased morbidity and 
decreased working capacity. Thirteen percent of the cohort had radiological 
abnormalities, mainly Scheuermann changes, in the thoracic and lumbar spine as 
adolescents, with no positive correlation to LBP in this period. Unlike other 
reports our results did not show any association between X-ray changes in the 
lower spine in adolescents and a higher prevalence of LBP in adults. Stepwise 
logistic regression analyses showed that LBP in the growth period and familial 
occurrence of back disease are important risk factors for LBP later in life, 
with an observed probability of 88% if both factors are present. Preventive 
measures in the school period seem to be of great importance.

Biomechanical abnormalities of post-polio patients and the implications for 
orthotic management.

Perry J(1), Clark D(1).

Downey, CA 90242, USA.

Muscle weakness resulting from the combined effects of acute and late motor 
neuron pathology is the basic cause of post-polio dysfunction. Through their 
normal sensation and moter control, post-polio patients minimize their 
disability by useful substitutions. Orthoses are needed only when these 
substitutions either are inadequate or result in muscle or joint overuse. The 
areas most commonly showing late disability are the lower extremities, shoulders 
and low-back. In the lower extremities, the major muscle groups are the hip 
extensors and abductors, the knee extensors (quadriceps), ankle plantar flexors 
and dorsi flexors. Each group has a specific function which relates to one of 
the basic tasks of walking, weight acceptance, single limb support and swing. To 
determine orthotic needs, polio gait deviations representing useful 
substitutions must be differentiated from symptomatic dysfunction. Weight 
acceptance utilizes the quadriceps, hip extensors and hip abductors to establish 
a stable limb and provide shock absorbing mechanics. Substitutions to preserve 
weight bearing stability include sacrifice of normal shock absorbing knee 
flexion for quadriceps weakness, backward or lateral trunk lean for hip extensor 
and abductor weakness. Knee pain, excessive hyperextension and flexion 
contractures are indications for orthotic assistance with a KAFO. Orthotic 
designs relate to the type of knee joint (off-set, free, locked) and 
completeness of the AFO component. Low-back pain from hip substitutions or over 
use of the hip muscles requires a walking aid. Single limb support is the period 
when the limb and body advance over the supporting foot. The key muscle group is 
the soleus-gastrocnemius complex. Swing involves lifting and advancing the 
unloaded limb. While all three joints flex simultaneously, the hip flexors and 
ankle dorsi flexors are the critical muscles. A drop foot from ankle dorsiflexor 
weakness is the common disability. Excessive hip flexion is the usual 
substitution. An orthosis which assists dorsiflexion without obstructing loading 
response plantar flexion is the most functional design.

Intramedullary neurenteric cyst without any associated malformation. One case 
evaluated by RMI and electron microscopic study.

A 46 years old woman presented with several years history of low back pain. For 
five years she suffered from weakness of the left lower limb and three years 
later she experienced an episode of right foot weakness. She suffered too from 
occasional urinary urgency. The examination showed decreased power and 
diminished sensory perception in the left leg. On myelography, a block at L2 
level was observed. RMI evaluation showed an intramedullary cyst in the anterior 
part of the spinal cord without any enhancement of its wall by the Gadolinium. 
At operation a thin-wall cyst was found containing clear fluid. After a biopsy 
of the wall, a cystosubarachnoid shunt was performed. Histological examination 
of the surgical sample showed a simple cuboidal epithelium lying on collagen 
fibrills. Electron microscopic studies showed ciliated cells with a 
clearly-visible basement membrane. The diagnosis of neurenteric cyst was 
confirmed. In the postoperative course the patient complained about sensory loss 
of the legs and the perineal area. Six months later, she exhibited a sensory 
disturbance of the feet and the right sacral area, a motor deficit of the distal 
left leg without urinary disturbance. Neurenteric cysts are dysraphic lesions 
which can be observed without other abnormalities. They are usually 
extramedullary and the intramedullary forms are very rare: among 5 cases 
reported in the literature, one has been evaluated by RMI. In the absence of 
enhancement by the Gadolinium, the other possible diagnosis seems an ependymal 
cyst. Contrary to extramedullary forms the postoperative course of 
intramedullary neurenteric cysts are not always eventful. Because the cyst wall 
cannot be removed, repeated RMI are desirable in the follow-up.

The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the overall incidence and 
distribution of lumbo-sacral degenerative changes (i.e. disc protrusion or 
extrusion, facet degeneration, disc degeneration, nerve root canal stenosis and 
spinal stenosis) in patients with and without a lumbo-sacral transitional 
vertebra (LSTV). The study population consisted of 350 sequential patients with 
low back pain and/or sciatica, referred for medical imaging. In all cases CT 
scans of the lumbo-sacral region were obtained. In 53 subjects (15%) and LSTV 
was found. There was no difference in overall incidence of degenerative spine 
changes between the two groups. We did find, however, a different distribution 
pattern of degenerative changes between patients with and those without an LSTV. 
Disc protrusion and/or extrusion occurred more often at the level suprajacent to 
the LSTV than at the same level in patients without LSTV (45.3% vs 30.3%). This 
was also the case for disc degeneration (52.8% vs 28%), facet degeneration 
(60.4% vs 42.6%) and nerve root canal stenosis (52.8% vs 27.9%). For spinal 
canal stenosis there was no statistically significant difference between the two 
categories. In conclusion, our findings indicate that an LSTV does not in itself 
constitute a risk factor for degenerative spine changes, but when degeneration 
occurs, it is more likely to be found at the disc level above the LSTV.

Low back pain is a common malady, affecting up to 80% of adults at some time. 
Our diagnostic capabilities have been markedly improved with the introduction 
and evolution of magnetic resonance imaging. MRI is an accurate modality in the 
diagnosis of disc herniation, as well as recurrent disc herniation, degenerative 
disc disease, and other abnormalities that may present as back pain.

Rheumatic diseases have not proved to be more prevalent among neurologic or 
psychiatric patients than in the general population, except for osteoarthritis 
in some chronic disabling neurologic conditions (poliomyelitis, spinal cord 
injury). Some neurologic entities with relevant musculoskeletal manifestations 
are described here. The lower prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in 
schizophrenia patients is mentioned, and a brief description is presented of 
somatoform disorders that may confound diagnosis with rheumatic diseases. 
Factitious disorders and malingering are frequently presented with rheumatic 
complaints such as low back pain and may have an important impact on the costs 
associated with the disease. Finally, some of the immune system abnormalities 
described in major depression and schizophrenia are mentioned with a clear 
reference to the growing field of psychoneuroimmunology. This paper will not 
address the issue of neurologic or psychiatric manifestations of rheumatic 
diseases.

Myofascial pain syndrome and trigger-point management.

Han SC(1), Harrison P.

14263, USA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a common condition 
often resulting in referral to a pain clinic. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, 
and various diagnostic tools are reviewed, and a variety of treatment methods 
are discussed.
METHODS: Extensive periodical literature and textbooks are reviewed, and 
selected manuscripts are critically analyzed.
RESULTS: The incidence of MPS with associated trigger points appears to vary 
between 30 and 85% of people presenting to pain clinics, and the condition is 
more prevalent in women than in men. Patients complain of regional persistent 
pain, ranging in intensity and most frequently found in the head, neck, 
shoulders, extremities, and low back. Muscle histologic abnormalities have been 
described in some studies. Similarly, electromyographic, thermographic, and 
pressure algometric studies have inconsistently identified abnormalities. A 
multidisciplinary approach to treatment appears to be most beneficial and may 
include such modalities as trigger-point injections, dry needling, stretch and 
spray, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The definitive pathogenesis of MPS is currently unknown, and no 
single diagnostic method is consistently positive. While trigger-point injection 
is the most widely employed method of treatment, other modes of therapy have 
also proved to be effective.

A case is presented of a transitional lumbosacral vertebra in a adolescent girl, 
presenting with low back pain. There was no evidence of a pars interarticularis 
defect. Careful assessment of children or adolescents presenting with low back 
pain is important since back pain in this age group is usually caused by organic 
disease.

Clinical trial of low-dose rHuG-CSF in neutropenic cancer patients following 
anti-cancer chemotherapy.

ROC.

Low-dose, subcutaneous recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(rHuG-CSF, Lenograstim) was administered to 40 cancer patients (17 men, 23 
women) enrolled from two medical centers to verify its clinical effectiveness 
and safety. The patients' mean age was 50.3 +/- 14.9 years. In this study, there 
were 20 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 10 with breast cancer and 10 with 
various other solid tumors. The patients first received a course of chemotherapy 
without rHuG-CSF (control cycle). All patients had at least one episode of 
neutropenia or leukopenia during the control cycle. rHuG-CSF (2 
micrograms/kg/day) was given subcutaneously for 10 days during the study cycle 
starting on the fourth day of chemotherapy. The nadirs of absolute neutrophil 
counts (ANC) were 1.8 +/- 0.25 x 10(9)/L and 0.27 +/- 0.05 x 10(9)/L for the 
rHuG-CSF cycle and pre-rHuG-CSF control cycle, respectively. The number of days 
of ANC < 1 x 10(9)/L were 1.03 +/- 0.29 and 7.38 +/- 0.58 for rHuG-CSF and 
control cycles, respectively. The duration from nadir to recovery of ANC (> or = 
2 x 10(9)/L) was 9.68 +/- 1.15 days in the rHuG-CSF cycle, vs 22.53 +/- 1.03 
days in the control cycle (p < 0.0001). No patient withdrew from the study. 
Adverse events were mild, with 12.5% to 40% of patients developing myalgia, 
general malaise, back pain, anorexia or fever. These side-effects were tolerable 
in all cases. The biochemical abnormalities were subtle and negligible. rHuG-CSF 
2 micrograms/kg/day given subcutaneously for 10 days beginning on the fourth day 
of chemotherapy is very effective (90%), safe and convenient.

Evaluating the child with back pain.

Sponseller PD(1).

Author information:
(1)Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

The most common causes of serious low back pain in children include 
spondylolysis, Scheuermann disease and musculoligamentous injury. Questions 
should be asked about the mechanism of onset and exacerbating factors, and the 
frequency, duration and severity of the pain. The examination should check gait 
and alignment, flexibility, strength and reflexes, and localize and evaluate the 
pain. Warning signs of serious problems include constant pain in a child younger 
than 11 years of age that lasts for several weeks or occurs spontaneously at 
night, repeatedly interferes with school, play or sports, or is associated with 
marked stiffness and limitation of motion, fever or neurologic abnormalities. 
Pain at the lumbosacral junction may suggest spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. 
Scheuermann disease is diagnosed by the observance of wedging, irregularity or 
growth disturbance of three successive vertebrae. Musculoligamentous pain may 
result from injury to or overuse of muscles or joints of the back. Rare causes 
include discitis, tuberculosis, bone or spinal cord tumor, pyelonephritis and 
retroperitoneal infection.

Skull infarction and epidural hematomas in a patient with sickle cell anemia.

Resar LM(1), Oliva MM, Casella JF.

Author information:
(1)Division of Pediatric Hematology, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, 
Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE: Epidural hematomas are unusual manifestations of sickling disorders. We 
report a patient with sickle cell anemia and multiple skull infarctions 
associated with epidural hematomas. The association of skull infarctions and 
epidural hematomas in sickling hemoglobinopathies is reviewed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 14-year-old boy with hemoglobin SS presented with lower 
back pain, left hip pain, headache, and fever. A bone scan was used to evaluate 
the patient for possible osteomyelitis. Head computed tomography (CT) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were employed to delineate intracranial 
pathology.
RESULTS: The bone scan showed multiple areas of decreased uptake in the skull 
consistent with acute infarction before abnormalities were present on physical 
examination. CT scan showed a bony contour deformity of the right frontal bone, 
suggestive of infarction. A right frontal extra-axial collection of blood was 
also observed below the bony abnormality. MRI further delineated bilateral 
frontal and left parietal collections adjacent to the bony abnormalities 
consistent with subacute epidural hematomas.
CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need to recognize skull infarctions and 
epidural hematomas as rare but potential complications of sickle cell disease. 
The diagnosis was facilitated by MRI, which has not been used in previous cases 
of skull infarctions. Moreover, our patient was successfully managed without 
surgical intervention.

From 1974 to 1994, anti-reflux ureterocysto-reimplantation was performed on 51 
children (1 boy, 50 Girls) aged from 10 months to 13 years. The follow-up 
duration of 45 cases was 3 months to 14 years. The clinical symptoms of 
frequency of urination, lumbago and repeatedly fever, etc, were not observed 
except urinary incontinence in 2 cases. The results showed that 
ureterocysto-reimplantation is simple and traumatic. Some important aspects such 
as preoperative location and intraoperative identification of the unilateral or 
bilateral ectopic ureters were analyzed.

Chronic low back pain.

Borenstein DG(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, George Washington University Medical Center, 
Washington, DC, USA.

Most episodes of low back pain are mechanical in origin and resolve within a 
12-week period. These acute episodes of back pain are associated with muscle 
strain and intervertebral disc herniation with radiculopathy. A smaller 
proportion of individuals have back pain with a duration greater than 12 weeks. 
These patients have back pain secondary to a wide variety of mechanical and 
nonmechanical disorders. The mechanical disorders associated with chronic low 
back pain include osteoarthritis and lumbar spinal stenosis; the nonmechanical 
disorders include infectious, neoplastic, rheumatologic, endocrinologic, 
vascular, and gynecologic. The clinical symptoms associated with each variety of 
disorder helps guide the appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Plain roentgenograms 
are useful in documenting the presence of spinal stenosis, benign or malignant 
tumors, osteoporosis, sacroiliitis, and spondylitis. CT scan is helpful in 
defining the bony alterations associated with malignant tumors and the vascular 
abnormalities associated with aneurysms. MR imaging is the technique of choice 
to document the extent of malignant processes and the presence of endometriosis 
in the pelvis. The therapy of these entities are specific for the disease entity 
causing the chronic low back pain. Although most of the disorders that cause 
chronic low back pain cannot be cured, therapy can decrease pain and improve 
function of the symptomatic patient.

Altered lower limb vascular perfusion in patients with sciatica secondary to 
disc herniation.

Maigne JY(1), Treuil C, Chatellier G.

Author information:
(1)Department of Rehabilitation and Orthopedic Medicine, Hotel-Dieu University 
Hospital, Paris, France.

STUDY DESIGN: The present study attempts to document deep vascular abnormalities 
of the lower extremity in cases of sciatica secondary to discal herniation using 
Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate angiography.
OBJECTIVES: Vascular abnormalities are studied compared with the contralateral 
extremity and normal control subjects. An attempt is made to determine the 
clinical usefulness of the current technique. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. 
Thermography has occasionally evidenced a decreased cutaneous temperature in 
patients with sciatica. There have been no studies to date looking at the total 
vascular flow in this condition, mainly constituted by the muscular perfusion.
METHODS: Thirty patients with sciatica secondary to discal herniation, 16 
patients with chronic low back pain referred to the thigh, and 31 control 
subjects were examined by isotopic angiography of the posterior aspect of the 
thigh after intravenous injection of Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate. The 
affected side was compared with the nonpainful side, and the difference was 
expressed as a percentage. Control subjects were used as reference values.
RESULTS: Abnormality in vascularization of the lower extremity was found in 24 
(80%) of patients with sciatica and in 11 (68.7%) of the patients with low back 
pain. The median blood flow difference was, respectively, -12.5% and +4% in 
these two groups versus +2.9% in the control group. The differences between the 
sciatica group and the other groups were statistically significant. No 
correlation was found with the clinical parameters studied.
CONCLUSION: Vascular perfusion abnormalities observed in patients with sciatica 
secondary to disc herniation may be more important than previously considered 
and possibly result from alteration in sympathetic vascular autoregulation.

The cases of 32-year-old man and 42-year-old women are presented. Their history 
illustrates difficulties in the diagnosis of tuberculosis of the vertebral 
column. The patients suffered significant pains in the lumbar region lasting one 
year. Despite the presence of some abnormalities in lumbar vertebrae on x-rays 
no examinations were ever performed to establish the diagnosis. Lumbago and 
osteoporosis were considered as the cause of complaints. Aetiology was confirmed 
only when patients developed disseminated tuberculosis of the lungs. 
Antituberculous chemotherapy was successful and brought a fast improvement in 
general status of the patients.

Loin pain haematuria syndrome.

Burke JR(1), Hardie IR.

Author information:
(1)Princess Alexandra, Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, 
Australia.

Loin pain haematuria syndrome is a descriptive diagnosis of recurrent episodes 
of loin pain accompanied by haematuria, in which investigations do not reveal 
adequate pathology to account for the symptoms. The majority of patients present 
between 20 and 40 years, but onset may occur in older children. A significant 
number of patients show psychological and psychopathological features. Renal 
histology may show minor abnormalities, including mesangial proliferation, 
arteriolar and arterial hyalinosis and C3 in arterioles. Renal angiography is 
often normal but changes in intrarenal arterioles and cortical infarcts may be 
seen. Haematological abnormalities include decreased heparin-thrombin clotting 
time and elevated free plasma serotonin concentration. It is important that the 
assessment include a detailed psychiatric history, the patient's perception of 
pain, and the psychosocial environment. The pain may be very severe, leading to 
the requirement for addictive analgesics: management often becomes very 
difficult and frustrating to medical practitioners. Surgical intervention with 
capsulotomy, denervation and autotransplantation should only be considered as a 
last resort, as there is frequent recurrence of pain on the same or 
contralateral side.

Elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase and its MB isoenzyme during normal 
labor and early puerperium.

Abramov Y(1), Abramov D, Abrahamov A, Durst R, Schenker J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical 
Center, Jerusalem, Israel.

BACKGROUND: Chest pain or discomfort are infrequent complaints among women 
during labor and early puerperium, but when present they raise the suspicion of 
myocardial ischemia. The diagnosis of the latter is based upon serum elevatIon 
of certain enzymes, such as aspartate amino transferase, lactate dehydrogenase 
and creatine phosphokinase. Nevertheless, the normal patterns of these enzymes 
in the serum during labor and early puerperium have not been characterized well.
OBJECTIVE: To determine serum creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase and 
aspartate amino transferase levels in late pregnancy, and throughout labor and 
early puerperium.
METHODS: Fifty women having normal pregnancies followed by uneventful vaginal 
deliveries were prospectively studied for serum lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate 
amino transferase and creatine phosphokinase including its MB isoenzyme before, 
during and after labor. Cardiac status was evaluated in all women using serial 
electrocardiographic and physical examinations.
RESULTS: All women were found to have low to normal antepartum serum enzymes 
levels. However, during labor total creatine phosphokinase increased markedly, 
reaching a peak of 2-4 fold baseline levels 24 hours postpartum. It then 
declined gradually back to baseline. Nulliparous women reached substantially 
higher levels than multiparous women. The MB or so-called cardio-specific 
isoenzyme was found to be an important contributor to creatine phosphokinase 
surge in most women. Correlation was demonstrated between length of the active 
phase of labor and both total and MB creatine phosphokinase activity. There was 
no clinical or electrocardiographic evidence for cardiac muscle damage in any of 
the study patients. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate amino transferase 
were not altered during or after labor.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum total creatine phosphokinase and its MB isoenzyme increase 
substantially during normal vaginal labor without evidence of myocardial 
ischemia. The uterus and placenta, two organs which were reported to embody 
substantial amounts of these enzymes, and which participate actively in the 
process of labor, are thought to release these enzymes to the circulation during 
labor. Knowing the normal patterns of these enzymes in the serum during labor 
and puerperium may prevent erroneous diagnoses of myocardial ischemia or 
infarction. Lack of electrocardiographic abnormalities and low lactate 
dehydrogenase and aspartate amino transferase levels may assist in excluding 
such diagnoses.

Electrodiagnostic findings of fibrillations and positive sharp waves in the 
lumbosacral paraspinals in patients without previous back surgery has been 
generally considered to be abnormal, consistent with posterior rami denervation. 
In some cases, it is the only abnormality on the electromyographic examination. 
This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of abnormal spontaneous 
activity in lumbosacral paraspinals in asymptomatic individuals. Nine (14.5%) of 
62 subjects studied had positive sharp waves or fibrillations noted on the 
needle examination of bilateral lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There was a 
significant increase in the prevalence of abnormal activity with increasing age. 
This suggests that caution should be taken in attributing radiculopathy as the 
etiology of low back pain when electromyographic lumbosacral paraspinal 
abnormalities are the only positive findings in the middle-aged or older 
individual.

[Spondylodiscitis after operation for lumbar disc herniation].

[Article in Japanese]

Imae S(1), Igarashi S, Koyama T.

Author information:

Postoperative spondylodiscitis (POD) is a rare but severe complication of lumbar 
disc surgery. There were five patients with POD among 875 patients undergoing 
surgery for herniated lumbar discs, in the last 16 years. For detecting risk 
factor of discitis, a POD group of 5 patients was matched to a control group of 
870 patients with respect to sex, age, disc type and operation. In five patients 
with POD follow-up evaluation of clinical symptoms, laboratory data were 
obtained, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed. A significant 
difference between the POD group and the control group was confirmed in sex, 
operation time and the volume of bleeding during operation. However, there was 
no significant difference confirmed due to age, disc type, disc level and 
operative procedure. In the case of males or prolonged operation time or 
increase of the volume of bleeding, POD may be more frequently observed. All 
five patients had a period of pain relief after their operations and then 
reported increasing low back pain with no focal signs. At diagnosis of POD all 
patients had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 30 per hour 
and C-reactive protein (CRP) higher than 2.5. After treatment by antibiotics, 
low back pain gradually receded along with decrease of ESR and CRP. About 40 
days later, these patients were almost free of back pain and ESR and CRP were 
within normal range. MRT1-weighted image during the acute phase demonstrated 
remarkably decreased signal intensity with loss of distinction between vertebral 
body and disc space. T2-weighted image showed increased signal intensity in the 
adjacent vertebral bodies and end-plates. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image 
had homogenous enhancement of vertebral body and disc space. During the subacute 
phase, however, T1-weighted image demonstrated moderately decreased signal 
intensity noted in the posteroinferior portion of the L5 vertebral body and the 
narrowed L5/S1 disc space. T2-weighted image showed iso signal intensity in L5 
and S1 vertebral bodies. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image had mild 
homogenous enhancement in the posteroinferior portion of the L5 vertebral body. 
Three months after treatment of POD, there was major signal change in neither T1 
nor T2 weighted images, though T2 showed subtle abnormalities with decreased 
signal intensity adjacent to the L5/S1 disc space.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 
45229, USA.

We reviewed the planar and single photon emission tomographic (SPET) spine 
images of 69 paediatric patients aged 2-17 years referred for undiagnosed back 
pain. The SPET images were obtained using a triple-detector camera and 
ultra-high-resolution collimation. Abnormal images were rated as slightly 
positive (1+) or strongly positive (2+). The planar and SPET images were normal 
in 48 of 69 patients. Thirteen of the remaining 21 cases had negative planar 
imaging with positive SPET images (SPET was 2+ in 10 cases and 1+ in 3 cases). 
Four of the 21 cases were 1+ on planar imaging, but clearly positive (2+) on the 
SPET images. Three of the 21 cases had 2+ planar abnormalities, but SPET 
demonstrated additional uptake abnormalities. Lastly, a single case that was 2+ 
on the planar images was demonstrated to be artefactual by SPET. Thirty-seven 
sites were abnormal by SPET, including 17 pedicle/parts interarticularis (11 
patients), 10 spinous process (8 patients), 8 vertebral endplate (2 patients) 
and 2 vertebral body (2 patients) abnormalities. Sites that were abnormal on 
SPET and normal on planar imaging included 10 of 17 (59%) in the pedicle/pars 
region, 9 of 10 (90%) in the spinous process, 1 of 2 (50%) in the vertebral body 
and 2 of 8 (25%) in the vertebral endplates. The improved resolution of 
ultra-high-resolution collimated multi-detector SPET permits visualization of a 
greater variety of abnormalities than was seen with earlier single-detector 
cameras, particularly those involving the spinous process.

Low-back pain in adolescent athletes.

Kujala UM(1), Taimela S, Erkintalo M, Salminen JJ, Kaprio J.

(1)Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Finland.

In this 3-yr longitudinal study we investigated the occurrence of low-back pain 
and anatomic changes in the low back in relation to loading and injuries among 
98 adolescents: 33 nonathletes (16 boys, 17 girls), 34 boy athletes (17 ice 
hockey, 17 soccer players), and 31 girl athletes (17 figure skaters, 14 
gymnasts). During the 3-yr follow-up, low-back pain lasting longer than 1 wk was 
reported by 29 (45%; 95% CI, 32%-57%) athletes and by 6 (18%; 95% CI, 7%-35%) 
nonathletes (P = 0.0099). Acute back injury was reported by 17 of 19 subjects 
who also reported low-back pain (89%; 95% CI, 67%-99%) and by 2 of 63 of those 
without prolonged low-back pain (3%; 95% CI, 0%-11%) (P < 0.0001). Among 43 
girls participating in baseline and follow-up MRI examinations of the lumbar

(75%; 95% CI, 35%-97%) and in 8 of the remaining 35 girls (23%; 95% CI 10% to 
40%) (P = 0.018). In conclusion, excessive loading that involves a risk for 
acute low-back injuries during the growth spurt is harmful to the lower back.

Low back pain is an extremely common, seriously disabling, nonfatal public 
health problem worldwide. The National Low Back Pain Study was a multicenter 
study of a large, heterogeneous group of patients who have been referred to 
either a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon for the evaluation and treatment 
of a persistent complaint of low back pain. In this paper, we characterize 
persistent low back pain patients and their complaints, describe the impact of 
persistent low back pain on the patients' functional and psychological status, 
report on the patients' medical characteristics, and identify treatments that 
are currently prescribed for these patients. Persistent low back pain is most 
common among people in their mid-to-late thirties and early-to-mid forties. The 
patients are mostly white, well educated, and generally affluent. The majority 
are gainfully employed, but some quit working because of pain and those who do 
tend to be less educated, and more likely to be involved in litigation. The 
average patient has had low back pain intermittently for 10 years. The pain is 
usually well localized but its severity varies considerably. Besides pain, most 
persistent low back pain patients report a variety of motor and sensory 
deficits. Patients also report significant functional impairment at work, at 
play, and at home. The typical patient does not, however, display significant 
psychological distress. Most patients have consulted multiple health care 
providers, have received a variety of treatments, and have used a variety of 
medications to alleviate pain; a few have been subjected to more aggressive 
treatment measures including surgery, intradiscal therapy, and narcotic and 
psychoactive drugs. None of these treatments has been effective. Physical 
examinations of these patients do not provide significant clues for making a 
definitive diagnosis. Nonspecific abnormalities such as muscle spasm, 
tenderness, and trigger points are quite common, but motor weakness and sensory 
deficits in the lower extremities, and reflex changes in the knees and ankles, 
are much less common. The classic combination of reflex changes, motor weakness, 
and sensory deficits associated with specific protruded discs are extremely rare 
even though one of three patients had a diagnosis of disc herniation. Diagnostic 
imaging studies revealed that the majority of persistent low back pain patients 
have spondylotic abnormalities involving root compression or lumbar instability 
or both, with root compression as the primary cause of the complaint. Myofascial 
syndrome and lumbar instability were the next most common diagnoses. After a 
thorough evaluation by specialists in spinal disorders, three of five persistent 
low back pain patients were prescribed an additional course of conservative 
therapy, one of five was prescribed surgery, and the rest were prescribed no 
treatment. Persistent low back pain patients appear to be a distinct group of 
low back pain patients who are different from patients who have similar 
nonpersistent acute symptoms and those who have the chronic pain syndrome 
characterized by significant behavioral and psychological co-morbidities.

Seven females, six laboratory assistants, participated in the experimental part 
of the study. The level of muscular activity in different sitting work postures 
was recorded, using surface electrodes, as full-wave-rectified and low-pass 
filtered EMG, and normalised. The laboratory assistants also rated the degree of 
exertion in four different body regions during their ordinary microtome 
sectioning work, comparing the use of anterior chest support with the use of 
their usual chair with lumbar support. The use of anterior chest support reduced 
the muscular activity in the lumbar back muscles but increased it in the 
shoulder muscles. Perceived exertion in the neck, shoulders and thoracic back 
regions increased. Anterior chest support does not seem to solve the problem of 
neck- and-shoulder load-elicited pain during the work of preparing laboratory 
sections.

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan.

Fujita T(1).

Author information:
(1)Kobe University, Calcium Research Institute, Kishiwada, Osaka, Japan.

In Japan, unlike in the United States and Europe, where osteoporosis is 
synonymous with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the need for treatment of 
osteoporosis has been emphasized only for elderly women with established 
disease. This may be because women in the immediate postmenopausal period in 
Japan are virtually free of symptoms such as lumbago and signs such as spinal 
compression fracture. Osteoporosis typically does not manifest itself until 
about age 65; therefore, postmenopausal osteoporosis with vertebral fracture 
below the age of 60 is quite rare in Japan. Unique features of treatment for 
osteoporosis in Japan include rare use of estrogen replacement therapy, common 
use of vitamin D derivatives (especially 1alpha(OH) vitamin D) without notable 
side effects, and use of calcitonin almost exclusively in a low-dose 
intermittent regimen (20 U/week). Similarly, the use of ipriflavone is common, 
and calcium supplementation, especially with an active absorbable algae calcium 
with high bioavailability (AAACa), is effective and popular. The emphasis on the 
use of calcium, vitamin D, and calcitonin in the treatment of osteoporosis may 
be explained by an extremely low dietary calcium intake in Japan. Other factors 
that favor reliance on the calcium-focused approach and avoidance of estrogen 
include a fatalistic and naturalistic view toward menopause; an uneasiness with 
hormone replacement therapy; an older female population who seek osteoporosis 
treatment because of uneventful immediate postmenopausal periods; and the 
efficient absorption of calcium from the intestine with favorable response to 
exogenous vitamin D due to a long-standing calcium deficiency and possibly a low 
incidence of vitamin D-receptor abnormalities.

A 41-year-old man with low back pain and lumbar disc disease was found to have 
L-3 butterfly vertebra on imaging studies as an incidental finding. This 
uncommon congenital anomaly of the vertebral column is usually asymptomatic and 
of no clinical significance. Awareness of this deformity and its imaging 
features is important diagnostically.

Are radiologic changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine of adolescents risk 
factors for low back pain in adults? A 25-year prospective cohort study of 640 
school children.

Harreby M(1), Neergaard K, Hesselsøe G, Kjer J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Rheumatology, Centralsygehuset, Naestved, Denmark.

STUDY DESIGN: This report was based on a 25-year prospective cohort study and 
designed as a self-administered questionnaire with low back pain as the main 
topic.
OBJECTIVE: To identify whether radiologic changes in the thoracic and lumbar 
spine and a history of low back pain in the adolescent period represent risk 
factors for low back pain in adults.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Six-hundred-forty 14-year-old school children were 
examined with x-rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine and registered by the 
school doctor regarding a history of low back pain.
METHODS: All of the x-rays and the short journals from the school doctor's 
registration were reviewed. This primary information was the basis of the 
investigation 25 years later.
RESULTS: Eleven percent of the cohort had a history of low back pain in 
adolescence, and the results showed an 84% lifetime prevalence of low back pain 
in these subjects as adults and an increased frequency of low back pain the last 
month and week before they answered the questionnaire, compared with the rest of 
the cohort. These problems were associated with increased morbidity and 
decreased working capacity. Thirteen percent had radiologic abnormalities, 
mainly Scheuermann changes, in the thoracic and lumbar spine as adolescents, 
with no positive correlation to low back pain in this period. Unlike other 
reports, our results did not confirm a positive correlation between x-ray 
changes in the lower spine in adolescents and a higher prevalence of low back 
pain in adults. Stepwise logistic regression analyses showed that low back pain 
in the growth period and familial occurrence of back disease are important risk 
factors for low back pain later in life, with an observed probability of 88% if 
both factors are present.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that low back pain in the growth period is "a 
real problem," with a trend toward aggravation as time passes. Thus, 
implementing preventive measures in schools may be very important.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine. Evaluation of asymptomatic 
individuals.

55407, USA.

We reviewed magnetic resonance imaging studies of the thoracic spines of ninety 
asymptomatic individuals to determine the prevalence of abnormal anatomical 
findings. This group included sixty individuals who had no history of any 
thoracic or lumbar pain and thirty individuals who had a history of low-back 
pain only. In addition, we reviewed imaging studies of eighteen patients who had 
an operatively proved herniation of a thoracic disc and studies of thirty-one 
patients who had been seen with thoracic pain. Sagittal T1-weighted spin-echo 
and axial multiplanar gradient refocused images at each disc level were 
interpreted by us (two neuroradiologists and two orthopaedic spine surgeons); we 
had no clinical information about the patients. Sixty-six (73 percent) of the 
ninety asymptomatic individuals had positive anatomical findings at one level or 
more. These findings included herniation of a disc in thirty-three subjects (37 
percent), bulging of a disc in forty-eight (53 percent), an annular tear in 
fifty-two (58 percent), deformation of the spinal cord in twenty-six (29 
percent), and Scheuermann end-plate irregularities or kyphosis in thirty-four 
(38 percent). This study documents the high prevalence of anatomical 
irregularities, including herniation of a disc and deformation of the spinal 
cord, on the magnetic resonance images of the thoracic spine in asymptomatic 
individuals. We emphasize that these findings represent roentgenographic 
abnormalities only, and any clinical decisions concerning the treatment of pain 
in the thoracic spine usually require additional studies.

Comment in
    Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 1996 Apr 1;21(7):898-9.

The clinical features of many cases of low back pain is inadequately explained 
by anatomic abnormalities alone. A pathophysiologic mechanism that includes a 
combination of mechanical and biochemical factors is an alternative explanation 
that is accompanied by less paradox than a purely structural paradigm. A 
potential unifying feature includes inflammation of neural elements caused by 
the chemical components of the intervertebral disc. There is a historical basis 
to the concept of an immunologic potential of the lumbar disc. No discrete in 
situ evidence or discrete mechanism has been previously identified. The recent 
demonstration of immunohistopathologic evidence of an immunocompetent cellular 
response at the epidural interface of lumbar HNPs supports the concept of the 
immunogenic capacity of nucleus pulposus. The identification of high levels of 
an inflammatory enzyme, phospholipase A2, in lumbar herniated and degenerative 
discs presents the basis for a direct inflammogenic capability of lumbar discs, 
separate from a immunologic mechanism. Subsequent experimental findings of 
conduction block and perineural inflammation as a consequence of extrathecal 
application of autologous nucleus pulposus and axonal injury after animal nerve 
injection of the human disc phospholipase A2 further validates this concept. 
There is a strong theoretic basis to support the concept that the clinical 
features of many lumbar disc patients may be explained by inflammation caused by 
biochemical factors alone or combined with mechanical deformation of lumbar 
tissues, rather than mechanical factors alone.

Extracranial metastasis of glioblastoma is rare. This is an autopsy case report 
of a patient with glioblastoma multiforme found to have metastasized to the 
liver. A 42-year-old woman was admitted with a chief complaint of headache. 
Physical and neurological examinations on admission showed no abnormalities. CT 
and MRI demonstrated a tumor in the left parietooccipital region with invasion 
into the subependymal area of the left lateral ventricular trig-one. A cerebral 
angiogram showed tumor staining in the same area. Subtotal tumor resection was 
performed uneventfully. The microscopic diagnosis was glioblastoma multiforme. 
Postoperatively, the patient underwent whole brain and local irradiation, and 
intra-arterial ACNU infusion therapy. One month later, she developed low back 
pain, probably due to spinal dissemination. Postmortem examination showed local 
recurrence of the tumor and subarachnoidal dissemination not only in the base of 
the skull but in the lower spinal cord. Tumor was also observed in the liver, 
but no lung or lymph node metastasis was detected. Metastasis to the liver in 
this patient is believed to have occurred via the anastomosis between the 
vertebral and portal venous system.

Occult intrasacral meningocele with tethered cord--case report.

Author information:

A 32-year-old female presented with a history of intermittent, severe lower back 
pain, exacerbated by pregnancy and persisting for several years. Magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging showed a sacral mass as a low signal intensity area on 
the T1-weighted image and a high signal intensity area on the T2-weighted image, 
consistent with a cystic structure containing cerebrospinal fluid. A tethered 
cord attached to the thecal sac was also confirmed. Sacral laminectomy revealed 
thinned sacral vertebral laminae, but no neuronal elements existed within the 
cyst. The cyst was attached to the distal thecal sac by a small fistula. The 
thecal sac was explored, revealing a thick filum terminale, which was 
transected. The severe pain resolved postoperatively. This type of meningeal 
cyst, often called "occult intrasacral meningocele," is best diagnosed by MR 
imaging. Surgery to obliterate the fistulous tract is the optimum treatment. 
Total removal of the cyst is unnecessary, but evaluation of other associated 
congenial abnormalities is important.

Paraspinal mapping. Quantified needle electromyography of the paraspinal muscles 
in persons without low back pain.

Haig AJ(1), LeBreck DB, Powley SG.

Author information:
(1)Medical College of Wisconsin, Department of Physical Medicine & 
Rehabilitation, Milwauke, USA.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a case series with intervention performed by masked 
investigators.
OBJECTIVES: To determine values for normal subjects on quantified needle 
electromyography of the paraspinal muscles compared with a previous sample of 
patients with clear evidence of radiculopathy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Diagnosis of radicular back pain is difficult, even 
with modern imaging studies, partly due to the large percentage of imaging 
abnormalities in asymptomatic persons. Electromyography has been shown to be as 
sensitive as imaging studies in diagnosing radicular pain. An electromyographic 
study of the low back has never been done in normal subjects. We have previously 
anatomically validated and clinically demonstrated a method of quantitative 
needle electromyography in the paraspinal muscles called paraspinal mapping.
METHODS: Thirty-five subjects free of back pain or polyneuropathy were 
intermixed with volunteers referred for electromyography of radicular back pain. 
One electrodiagnostician punctured the skin at five predetermined locations and 
obtained paraspinal mapping scores in one of these. An electromyographer who was 
masked to the study's nature then performed a complete paraspinal mapping study. 
A total "sensitivity" score was compared to scores of previously tested patients 
who had pain complaints and clear evidence for radiculopathy on either 
radiologic or traditional electromyographic studies.
RESULTS: Mean score in normal subjects was 1.11 (SD 1.49). Mean score for 
abnormal subjects averaged 12.18 (SD 12.03). Differences between examiners were 
insignificant.
CONCLUSIONS: Normal persons have few, if any electromyographic abnormalities in 
the paraspinal muscles. This is in contrast to computed tomography, magnetic 
resonance imaging, or myelographic results in normal subjects. Persons with 
radiculopathy have significantly different scores. Needle electromyographic 
examination of the paraspinal muscles is useful in distinguishing false-positive 
radiologic studies.

Low back pain.

Wipf JE(1), Deyo RA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.

Low back pain is a common reason for physician visits and is associated with 
enormous costs to health care and industry. Radiographic abnormalities of the 
lumbar spine, including disk protrusion, are common in asymptomatic subjects and 
only loosely associated with symptoms and neurologic examination. Therefore, 
highly selective evaluation is required to avoid subjecting patients with back 
pain to unnecessary tests and surgical procedures. Reassurance about the 
favorable prognosis of low back pain is an important component of therapy. Most 
patients with simple back pain recover with symptomatic treatment. Plain 
radiographs are indicated for evaluation of patients with radiculopathy and 
those with risk factors for underlying medical conditions. The majority of 
patients with back pain, even those with radiculopathy, improve with 
conservative management and surgery is unnecessary. Surgical consultation and CT 
or MR imaging scans are indicated for patients with persistent or progressive 
neurologic deficits or persistent sciatica with nerve root tension signs. Acute 
radiculopathy with bilateral neurologic deficits, saddle anesthesia, or urinary 
symptoms is suggestive of cord compression or cauda equina syndrome and requires 
urgent surgical referral.

An 18-year-old new army recruit had been treated by his medical officer for low 
back pain. The pain was not relieved by medication, and the soldier was referred 
to an orthopedic clinic. Muscle power, reflexes, and sensation were all normal 
for the lumbar and sacral nerves. Roentgenograms revealed a hemivertebra at the 
level of the first sacral segment. This is a very rare cause of backache in 
patients with intact and functioning lumbar and sacral nerves.

Spondylolisthesis is considered one of the common causes of back pain in 
children. There are far fewer cases reported in children under the age of 4 
years. However, all patients described were diagnosed by radiographic 
examination in a workup for other congenital or musculoskeletal abnormalities. 
This report describes a 2-year-old girl who presented with low back pain and was 
subsequently diagnosed with spondylolisthesis.

Herniated intervertebral disc-associated periradicular fibrosis and vascular 
abnormalities occur without inflammatory cell infiltration.

Jayson MI.

Author information:

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective histologic comparison of perineural tissues from 
patients requiring decompression surgery for herniated intervertebral disc with 
those from cadaveric controls.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the significance of herniated 
intervertebral-disc-associated perineural vascular and fibrotic abnormalities 
with respect to back pain symptom generation.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous cadaveric studies have demonstrated 
perineural vascular congestion, dilatation, and thrombosis and perineural and 
intraneural fibrosis occurring in association with herniated intervertebral 
disc. It was suggested that these neural abnormalities were the result of 
ischemia, due to venous outflow obstruction, and also represented a possible 
cause of ongoing back pain symptoms. Criticisms of such a conclusion arose, 
however, because the possibility could not be excluded that these abnormalities 
were the result of postmortem artifact.
METHODS: Histologic and immunohistochemical comparison of discal and peridiscal 
tissues removed from 11 patients with radiographically proven herniated 
intervertebral disc requiring decompressive surgery and from 6 fresh cadavers 
without history of back pain in life.
RESULTS: Histology and immunohistochemistry of perineural and extraneural 
tissues from patients revealed vascular congestion, neovascularization, and 
endothelial abnormalities including luminal platelet adhesion, in association 
with reductions in von Willebrand factor levels, together with perivascular and 
perineural fibrosis. Elevated fibrogenic cytokine concentrations were also 
detected in patients' tissues. These changes occurred without evidence of 
inflammation and were absent in cadaveric control tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: The vascular abnormalities detected in patients may represent an 
important etiopathologic factor predisposing to intraneural and perineural 
fibrosis, and hence to chronic pain symptoms, after disc herniation. It seems 
important to preserve the perineural microcirculation following disc herniation.

Stress fractures in runners.

Brukner PD(1), Bennell KL(2).

Author information:
(1)Olympic Park Sports Medicine Centre, Swan Street, Melbourne, Australia.
(2)Department of Human Biosciences, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.

Stress fractures, were first described in military recruits but in recent years 
have increasingly been described in runners. In most surveys they comprise 
between 10 and 20% of all running injuries. The tibia is the most common site of 
all stress fractures although recent studies involving track and field athletes 
show an increased incidence of navicular stress fractures. The diagnosis is 
based on the clinical findings of a history of exercise-related bone pain with 
local bony tenderness on examination. The diagnosis is often confirmed by a 
typical appearance on an isotope bone scan or plain radiograph. In general, 
treatment consists of relative rest from the aggravating activity until 
symptom-free and then graduated resumption of activity. Attention also needs to 
be paid to correction of possible causative factors. These include excessive 
training, low bone density, low calcium intake, menstrual abnormalities in 
females and biomechanical features such as excessive sub-talar pronation. 
Certain stress fractures, such as those in the navicular, require specific 
management, e.g. six weeks non-weight bearing cast immobilization.

Haemodynamic changes in lumbar nerve root entrapment due to stenosis and/or 
herniated disc of the lumbar spinal canal--a magnetic resonance imaging study.

Castro WH(1), Assheuer J, Schulitz KP.

Author information:
(1)Orthopädische Klinik der Westfälischen Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Germany.

A prospective MRI study was carried out to assess the secondary changes in 
patients with stenosis and/or herniated disc of the lumbar spinal canal. The 
study covered 100 patients who had low back and leg pain due to such processes. 
Of these, 60 patients (group A) had a monoradicular pain pattern, average 
duration 2 months, due to a herniated lumbar disc. The remaining 40 patients 
(group B) had acute exacerbation of their chronic low back and leg pain, due to 
stenosis and herniated disc. As a control group, 5 asymptomatic volunteers with 
neither stenosis nor herniated disc on MRI were examined. All the patients and 
volunteers were examined by MRI with several sequences: partial saturation 
recovery with phase contrast PS (500/10), spin echo SE (500/20), short TI 
inversion recovery STIR (1900/135/30) and, for the dynamic study, field-gradient 
echo sequences FAST (50/15): 10 frames in 200 s. In all participants, Gd-DTPA 
was administered intravenously. In 8 of the patients of group B capillarisation 
in the protruded nucleus tissue was demonstrated on the PS sequence after 
Gd-DTPA administration. This tissue also showed decreased signal intensity on 
the STIR sequence. The capillarisation extended into the centre of the disc. 
Venous stasis could be verified in all of the 100 patients. An oedema could be 
verified in all patients of group A; in 20%, its size exceeded that of the 
herniated disc. In group B, an oedema was seen in only 12 patients. In the 
control group, no haemodynamic changes were seen. Using MRI, it is possible to 
define the border between herniated disc tissue and perifocal oedema.(ABSTRACT

Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis: experience of twenty-one patients.

Smith R(1).

Author information:
(1)Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Headington, Oxford.

The features and outcome of 21 children (12 boys, nine girls) with idopathic 
juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) followed for up to 23 yr are described. The mean age 
of onset was 7 yr (range 1-13 yr) with no sex difference; the main presenting 
symptoms were long bone fractures, pain in the back and difficulty in walking. 
Typically, radiographs demonstrated compression of the vertebrae and metaphyses 
of the long bones; bone histology sometimes showed an excess of osteocytes 
associated with woven bone; routine biochemistry was normal for age; and with 
three exceptions no abnormalities of extracted dermal collagen or collagen 
synthesized by fibroblasts were detected. Where circulating vitamin D 
metabolites were measured they were within the normal range; and hip and spine 
bone mineral density (measured by DXA) was strikingly low. Five patients are 
still growing and two are currently untraceable. Of the remaining 14 who are now 
adults, 11 have substantially or completely recovered and three are disabled. 
Since spontaneous recovery occurs it remains impossible to assess the many forms 
of treatment given.

Back pain in young athletes. Significant differences from adults in causes and 
patterns.

Micheli LJ(1), Wood R.

Author information:

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there are significant differences in the causes 
of back pain in young athletes compared with the general adult population and to 
review the diagnosis and assessment of young athletic adolescent patients who 
present with this complaint.
DESIGN: Retrospective randomized case comparison study with two cohorts 
segregated by age and type of activity.
SETTING: The adolescent sports medicine clinic of a children's hospital compared 
with the acute low back pain clinic of an orthopedic hospital.
PATIENTS: One hundred adolescent athletes (aged 12 to 18 years; mean age, 15.8 
years) with a chief complaint of low back pain were compared with 100 adults 
(aged 21 to 77 years; mean age, 31.9 years) with acute low back pain.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES/RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of the adolescents had 
derangements of their posterior elements associated with the onset of back pain. 
Forty-seven percent of the 100 adolescents were ultimately shown to have a 
spondylolysis stress fracture of the pars interarticularis. By contrast, 5% of 
adult subjects were found to have spondylolysis associated with low back pain. 
Similarly, discogenic back pain was the final diagnosis in 48 of the 100 
subjects in the adult group, while 11 of the 100 in the adolescent group had 
back pain attributable to disc abnormalities. Muscle-tendon strain accounted for 
back pain in 27% of the adults, while only 6% of the adolescents were diagnosed 
as having muscle-tendon strain. These differences were significant. Spinal 
stenosis and osteoarthritis as causes of back pain were encountered in 10% of 
the adults, while these conditions were not encountered in the children.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant differences in the major causes of low back 
pain in young athletes compared with causes of low back pain in the general 
adult population. Physicians diagnosing back pain in young athletes must have a 
specific understanding of these differences to avoid incorrect diagnosis and 
harmful delays in proper treatment.

The sacroiliac joint in chronic low back pain.

Schwarzer AC(1), Aprill CN, Bogduk N.

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Medicine, University of Newcastle, Australia.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional analytic study.
OBJECTIVES: In relation to pain from the sacroiliac joint, this study sought to 
establish 1) its prevalence, 2) the validity of pain provocation, 3) whether any 
arthrographic abnormalities predict a response to joint block, and 4) whether 
certain pain patterns discriminate patients with this diagnosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The true prevalence of sacroiliac joint pain is 
unknown and despite a plethora of clinical tests, none of these tests has been 
validated against an established criterion standard. To our knowledge, 
arthrography of the sacroiliac joint had never been studied.
METHODS: Forty-three consecutive patients with chronic low back pain maximal 
below L5-S1 were investigated with sacroiliac joint blocks under image 
intensifier using radiographic contrast followed by 2% lignocaine. Information 
was obtained on pain provocation, analgesia, and image pattern.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients (30%) obtained gratifying relief of their pain. Nine 
of these also exhibited tears of their ventral capsule. Groin pain was the only 
pain referral pattern found to be associated with response to sacroiliac joint 
block.
CONCLUSION: The sacroiliac joint is a significant source of pain in patients 
with chronic low back pain and warrants further study.

Sarcoidosis of the bones in the hands and feet is not uncommon. However, 
sarcoidosis involving the axial skeleton is unusual. The authors present the 
case of a 37-year-old man with sarcoidosis who developed low-back pain. 
Radionuclide bone scan demonstrated abnormalities in the pelvis, spine, and 
scapulae. A bone scan directed open biopsy of an abnormality in diagnostic 
tissue from the ilium.

[Chemonucleolysis of disk herniation with low back pain as the single symptom: 
20 cases].

Disk herniation can manifest as isolated low back pain, which is usually 
intermittent and accompanied with stiffness of the lumbar spine. There is almost 
general agreement that neither neurosurgical treatment nor chemonucleolysis is 
appropriate in patients with this clinical pattern. We used chemonucleolysis in 
19 patients with recurrent episodes of isolated low back pain and one patient 
with severe permanent isolated low back pain dating back to a 
conservatively-treated episode of sciatica. All 20 patients had disk herniation 
documented by imaging studies. A very good or satisfactory outcome was recorded 
in ten patients after three months, 11 after six months and 12 in March 1993 
after a mean follow-up of 72 months. The treatment was well tolerated, even in 
those patients who were not improved; a single patient developed an episode of 
acute low back pain that required surgical treatment. In patients with low back 
pain and disk herniation, there is currently no means of determining whether a 
causal relationship links these two abnormalities. Nevertheless, we believe that 
chemonucleolysis can be proposed in severe forms, provided the patients are 
apprised of current success rates.

Comment in
    J Rheumatol. 2000 Oct;27(10):2295-301.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single 
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the detection of sacroiliitis in 
patients with clinical features of inflammatory back disease but without 
conventional radiographic changes.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with inflammatory low back pain (ILBP) and normal 
or suspicious changes of sacroiliitis (New York criteria: 0-1) on conventional 
radiography, in addition to 12 control subjects were studied. MRI, bone and 
SPECT scans of the sacroiliac (SI) joints were obtained and interpreted without 
knowledge of patient identification. MRI scans were scored according to the 
modified New York criteria and examined for the presence of joint fluid, 
abnormalities in articular cartilage and in the underlying marrow signal. A 
quantitative and qualitative assessment of radiopharmaceutical uptake in the SI 
joints was derived from planar bone scan films and SPECT scans.
RESULTS: MRI detected features of scaroiliitis in 54% of patients with ILBP and 
in 17% of controls (p = 0.07). Quantitative and qualitative analysis of planar 
bone scan films did not reveal any differences between the 2 patient groups. In 
contrast, SPECT scanning identified sacroiliitis in 38% of patients with ILBP 
compared to none in controls (p = 0.05). When MRI and SPECT scanning were 
combined there was evidence of sacroiliitis in 63% of patients with ILBP and in 
17% of controls (p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: MRI and SPECT bone scanning provide objective and complementary 
evidence of sacroiliitis in patients with clinical features of inflammatory 
spinal disease in the absence of conventional radiographic changes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A 36-year-old woman was scheduled for surgery of 
bicornuate uterus under epidural anesthesia.
METHODS: As a test dose, 3 mL 2.5% thiamylal was injected unintentionally 
through the epidural catheter instead of 1.5% lidocaine with 15 micrograms 
epinephrine.
RESULTS: Immediately the patient complained of burning pain in the low back 
area. Administrations of 10 mL 2% lidocaine without epinephrine and 10 mL normal 
saline containing hydrocortisone 100 mg were performed through the epidural 
catheter.
CONCLUSIONS: The patient recovered without permanent neurologic sequelae.

The rare anomaly of cleft pedicle co-existing with bilateral pars 
interarticularis defects and ipsilateral transverse process hypoplasia of a 
lumbar vertebra is described in a 39-year-old male presenting with chronic low 
backache. The importance of recognizing pedicular clefts as congenital anomalies 
and distinguishing them from fractures or destructive processes is emphasized, 
and the relationship of pedicular clefts to hypoplastic or absent pedicles is 
discussed.

York-Stony Brook 11794-8691.

We describe a 48-year-old woman with loin pain-hematuria syndrome. Her renal 
abnormalities included conspicuous microaneurysmal and glomeruloid (plexiform) 
angiomatous changes. The deposition of both properdin and the C5b-9 complex, as 
well as the usual C3, in arterioles argues for complement activation. To our 
knowledge, neither of these features has been previously described. We speculate 
about the cause of loin pain-hematuria syndrome and note the uncommonness of 
this entity in the United States as opposed to Great Britain.

We carried out MRI studies of 74 patients with end-plate and vertebral 
bone-marrow changes associated with degenerative lumbar disc disease. 
Abnormalities were classified into type A, with decreased signal intensities, 
and type B, with increased signal intensities on T1-weighted spin-echo images. 
Twenty-seven (73%) of the 37 patients with type-A changes had low back pain, in 
contrast to only four (11%) of the 37 patients with type-B changes. Lateral 
flexion-extension radiographs showed hypermobility in 26 patients (70%) with 
type-A changes, and in only six (16%) with type-B changes. Type-A changes 
correlated with segmental hypermobility and low back pain, while type-B changes 
were more common in patients with stable degenerative disc disease.

Interventional musculoskeletal radiology.

el-Khoury GY(1), Renfrew DL, Walker CW.

Author information:

Interventional procedures constitute a significant proportion of musculoskeletal 
radiology. Percutaneous needle biopsy is the ultimate diagnostic technique for 
the evaluation of musculoskeletal neoplasms and infections. The procedure is 
accurate, rapid, and safe. It is ideally suited for the diagnosis of metastatic 
disease and round cell neoplasms. Several needle procedures have been used for 
the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain. Diskography is primarily a 
diagnostic test used to determine the symptomatic disk level when multilevel 
disk disease is present and also to diagnose internal disk disruption. Nerve 
block with local anesthetic is also used to locate the symptomatic level in 
patients with multilevel abnormalities. Epidural steroid injection is a 
therapeutic procedure that commonly is used in patients with low back pain and 
has been shown to be most effective in patients with disk herniation. Facet 
joint injection with local anesthetic and steroid is performed to diagnose and 
treat the facet syndrome. Other needle procedures in the musculoskeletal system 
include sacroiliac joint aspiration and injection, prosthetic joint aspiration 
to evaluate potential infection, distention arthrography, and injections of the 
coccyx for coccydynia.

BACKGROUND: The relation between abnormalities in the lumbar spine and low back 
pain is controversial. We examined the prevalence of abnormal findings on 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the lumbar spine in people without 
back pain.
METHODS: We performed MRI examinations on 98 asymptomatic people. The scans were 
read independently by two neuroradiologists who did not know the clinical status 
of the subjects. To reduce the possibility of bias in interpreting the studies, 
abnormal MRI scans from 27 people with back pain were mixed randomly with the 
scans from the asymptomatic people. We used the following standardized terms to 
classify the five intervertebral disks in the lumbosacral spine: normal, bulge 
(circumferential symmetric extension of the disk beyond the interspace), 
protrusion (focal or asymmetric extension of the disk beyond the interspace), 
and extrusion (more extreme extension of the disk beyond the interspace). 
Nonintervertebral disk abnormalities, such as facet arthropathy, were also 
documented.
RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of the 98 asymptomatic subjects had normal disks at 
all levels. With the results of the two readings averaged, 52 percent of the 
subjects had a bulge at at least one level, 27 percent had a protrusion, and 1 
percent had an extrusion. Thirty-eight percent had an abnormality of more than 
one intervertebral disk. The prevalence of bulges, but not of protrusions, 
increased with age. The most common nonintervertebral disk abnormalities were 
Schmorl's nodes (herniation of the disk into the vertebral-body end plate), 
found in 19 percent of the subjects; annular defects (disruption of the outer 
fibrous ring of the disk), in 14 percent; and facet arthropathy (degenerative 
disease of the posterior articular processes of the vertebrae), in 8 percent. 
The findings were similar in men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: On MRI examination of the lumbar spine, many people without back 
pain have disk bulges or protrusions but not extrusions. Given the high 
prevalence of these findings and of back pain, the discovery by MRI of bulges or 
protrusions in people with low back pain may frequently be coincidental.

Inter- and intraobserver variability in the interpretation of computed 
tomography of the lumbar spine.

Author information:
(1)Department of Rheumatology, Ambroise Paré Hospital, Boulogne, France.

In order to assess the variability in interpreting lumbar CT-scans, two 
radiologists and two rheumatologists examined the same set of 40 CT-scans and 
evaluated the presence of primary abnormalities using pre-established criteria. 
Inter- and intraobserver concordance was assessed using kappa statistics. 
Interpretation of herniated nucleus pulposus appeared reliable in this study 
(interobserver and intraobserver kappa statistics approximately 0.7 and 0.9, 
respectively). Conversely, significant variability of interpretation was seen in 
many findings often considered important in benign low-back pain or sciatica. 
Particularly low levels of agreement (interobserver kappa statistics lower to 
0.20) were found for facet joint osteoarthritis and spinal stenosis. Since 
herniated nucleus pulposus appeared as the only reliable CT finding, lumbar CT 
ordering should therefore be currently restricted to confirmation and 
localization of herniated nucleus pulposus, especially when surgery or any other 
invasive intervention is planned to treat prolonged sciatica.

Comment in
    J Nucl Med. 1994 Mar;35(3):422-4.

The authors reviewed planar, SPECT and other contemporaneous radiologic images 
of the spine and the medical records of 33 patients with back pain after lumbar 
fusion surgery in order to determine the value of SPECT in the assessment of 
painful late effects of spinal fusion surgery.
METHODS: Twenty-one patients had lateral fusion, nine patients had posterior 
fusion only and three patients had anterior and posterior fusions. There were 24 
patients who had surgery more than 4 yr ago (late group, mean 11.8 yr) and 9 
patients who had surgery less than 4 yr ago (early group, mean 17.8 mo).
RESULTS: The most common SPECT abnormality in patients in the late group were 
lesions in the vertebral bodies and apophyseal joints in the free motion 
segments adjacent to the fused segments (62.5% of patients). Such lesions 
occurred in 46% of patients after lateral fusion, in 87.5% of patients after 
posterior fusion and in 67% of patients after posterior and anterior fusions. No 
SPECT abnormalities were detected in the fused segments in patients in the late 
group with solid lateral fusion but were detected in three patients with solid 
posterior fusion. These results correlate with biomechanical studies that have 
shown posterior fusion to produce the largest amount and lateral fusion to 
produce the least amount of stress in the free segments adjacent to the fusion. 
Lateral fusion was found to have a more stabilizing effect than posterior 
fusion.
CONCLUSION: In addition to the already established value of SPECT in detecting 
painful pseudoarthrosis, our results indicate that SPECT is of value in the 
assessment of painful late effects of fusion.

Epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, and therapy of low back pain.

Borenstein D(1).

Author information:
(1)George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC.

New data concerning the epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, and 
treatment of low back pain have been reported over the past year. Patients who 
have a longer period of pain during the initial episode of pain are at greatest 
risk of recurrence of pain. Abnormalities of fibrinolytic activity may have 
predictive value in identifying patients who are at risk for a poor outcome from 
surgery. Scheuermann's kyphosis is a slowly progressive illness that rarely 
requires surgical stabilization of the spine. Contrast-enhanced magnetic 
resonance imaging may be able to identify symptomatic spinal nerve roots. 
Radiculopathy associated with disk herniations resolves frequently without 
surgical intervention. Large disk herniations may resolve spontaneously and do 
not require surgery. Spinal manipulation may be helpful on a short-term basis to 
decrease back pain but may be associated with occasional serious complications 
including cauda equina compression.

Sagittal plane rotation of the pelvis during lumbar posteroanterior loading.

Lee M(1), Lau H, Lau T.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of 
Sydney, Lidcombe, N.S.W., Australia.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of sagittal plane rotation of the pelvis 
during lumbar spine posteroanterior loading.
DESIGN: Quantitative study.
SETTING: Biomechanics Laboratory, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of 
Sydney.
PARTICIPANTS: Ten male and female subjects with no recent history of significant 
low back pain.
INTERVENTION: A mechanical device was used to apply forces to the L3 spinous 
process. Data were collected during slow cyclical loading.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The stiffness of the posteroanterior movement at the point 
of loading was measured, together with the sagittal plane rotation of the pelvis 
and the resistance to rotation provided by the bed on which the subject lay.
RESULTS: Mean pelvic rotation was 2.1 degrees per 100 N applied force (SD 1.01 
degrees/100 N). Mean posteroanterior stiffness was 13.4 N/mm (SD 3.13 N/mm) and 
resistance to pelvic rotation was 2.71 Nm/degree of pelvic rotation (SD 0.84 
Nm/degree).
CONCLUSION: During posteroanterior force application there is pelvic rotation of 
a magnitude that may be sufficient to have clinical significance. Abnormalities 
found during lumbar posteroanterior force application may originate in tissues 
caudad to the lumbar spine itself.

Spina bifida occulta of S1 is not an innocent finding.

Avrahami E(1), Frishman E, Fridman Z, Azor M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon.

One thousand two hundred patients (600 women and 600 men) aged 18 to 72 years 
were referred for computed tomographic examination of the lumbosacral spine 
(L3-S1) after low-back pain or sciatica. Patients with spinal abnormalities 
other than spina bifida occulta (SBO)-S1 and findings other than posterior 
herniation of intervertebral disc were not included in this study. All of the 
patients underwent conventional radiographs of the lumbosacral spine. The 
incidence of SBO-S1 was higher in younger age groups and decreased with age. 
Patients with SBO-S1 showed a higher incidence of posterior disc herniation, 
which increased with age. This can be explained by instability of the base of 
the lumbar spine caused by SBO-S1, which produces a predisposition to posterior 
disc herniation. The results were statistically significant.

Spinal instability is a loosely used term resulting from a variety of traumatic, 
developmental, neoplastic, hereditary, and degenerative insults to the axial 
skeleton. As defined by White and Panjabi, lumbar instability would imply the 
loss of the spine's ability, under physiological loads, to maintain its patterns 
of displacement so as to avoid neurologic deficits, incapacitating deformity, 
and intractable pain. Although from a strict engineering standpoint, the concept 
of load and deformation is valid, it is not at all known what type of movement 
or what magnitude of movement is responsible for low back pain. In light of 
these considerations, the author would define instability as either acute or 
chronic. Acute mechanical instability would result from those conditions such as 
fracture, tumor infiltration, infection, postlaminectomy, and certain congenital 
defects where a small change in loading or deformation could lead to permanent 
vertebral displacement with fixed deformity and/or neurologic damage. Chronic 
instability would result from those low back disorders that lead to progressive 
deformity over a period of years, often producing back pain from degenerative 
osteoarthritis, and central as well as foraminal stenosis. These disorders would 
include lumbar scoliosis, kyphosis, and spondylolisthesis, either isthmic or 
degenerative type. In those situations associated with more chronic instability, 
the relationship of low back pain is not always discernable even with 
provocative discography or magnetic resonance imaging. The surgical treatment of 
low back pain associated with these spinal instabilities depends on the etiology 
of the conditions defined. Acute traumatic injuries are best managed by 
posterior segmental instrumentation. At the level of the upper lumbar spine, a 
combined approach may be desirable to support anterior column 
deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The clinical efficacy of tolfenamic acid and mefenamic acid in the treatment of 
primary dysmenorrhoea was studied in a prospective, controlled, double-blind, 
cross-over study comprising 73 patients aged 13-39 with an average body weight 
of 56 kilos. The patients were randomized to receive either tolfenamic acid (200 
mg t.i.d.) or mefenamic acid (500 mg t.i.d.) for 3 days, during 3 consecutive 
menstrual cycles each, in a sequential design A-B or B-A. At the beginning and 
at the end of each treatment period, 13 dysmenorrhoeic symptoms were evaluated 
on a visual analogue scale (lower back pain, interference with daily activities, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, sweating, chills, hot 
flashes, depressant states, and mood swings). The data were analyzed by using 
two statistical models. The first one, for the 73 patients, by making paired 
comparisons regardless of treatment sequence. With respect to the initial 
values, the results showed that both drugs were statistically significant (P < 
0.05) in reducing the intensity of the evaluated symptoms. When comparing both 
treatments, tolfenamic acid showed a significant difference as to interference 
with daily activities (P < 0.025) and hot flashes (P < 0.005). In the result 
analysis with the second model, the groups were divided according to the first 
assigned treatment and paired comparisons were made. It was observed that the 
group receiving tolfenamic acid in the last sequence reached a higher level of 
response and statistical significance was demonstrated in 8 of 13 evaluated 
symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Clinical significance of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (Bertolotti

[Article in Hungarian]

500 lumbosacral plain x-ray injured patients and 1000 myelography of patients 
suffering from low back pain and nerve root sign were reviewed to evaluate the 
rate of transitional lumbosacral vertebra. This anomaly appeared in 4.6% in the 
normal population. The rate of the transitional vertebra in patients with nerve 
root syndrome was double (8.4%) whereas that with lumbar disc herniation four 
time as many as in the normal population. The data demonstrate that the 
asymmetrical anomalies have more clinical significance. The authors consider, 
that the role of the transitional vertebra is twofold: it can be consider 
primary in low back and sciatic pain, but in the formation of lumbar disc 
herniation is secondary. They find the analysis of the lumbosacral plain x-ray 
is necessary even in cases with CT and MRI.

Repeat lumbar spine surgery. Factors influencing outcome.

Bernard TN Jr(1).

Author information:
(1)Hughston Clinic, Columbus, Georgia.

Forty-five patients who had residual symptoms after lumbar spine surgery were 
re-evaluated and underwent additional surgery. After a minimum of 2 years' 
follow-up, these patients' results were reviewed to determine what variables 
might predict long-term outcome. Age, number of previous operations, and 
psychological diagnosis were not statistically significant, but a 
non-compensable injury, ability to return to work after surgery, a negative 
history of litigation, and achieving a solid fusion were statistically 
significant in predicting a good outcome. In this study of 45 patients who had 
repeat surgery, 82% were improved at an average follow-up of 28.2 months. 
Intrathecally enhanced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, 
discography, and computed tomography-discography are required to thoroughly 
evaluate the previously operated lumbar spine, because a single imaging study 
showed surgical abnormalities in only 61% of the patients in this study.

A 28-year-old, previously healthy man was referred to our hospital three months 
after the appearance of lumbago, leg pains and fever. Routine examinations were 
normal. Phlebography demonstrated occlusion of the common femoral veins by 
thrombosis. Inferior vena cavography and magnetic resonance image showed that 
the inferior vena cava (IVC) became gradually narrower from the level of 11th 
thoracic vertebra. An intravascular endoscopic study gave the same morphological 
findings; the endothelial surface was found to be intact. We concluded that the 
stenosis of the IVC was the primary lesion and was the essential pathological 
condition. The massive thrombosis appeared to have occurred secondarily.

Hematometra as a cause of lumbar radiculopathy. A case report.

Deathe AB(1).

Author information:

Ontario, Canada.

Low-back pain combined with a positive straight leg raising test (Lasègue's 
sign) is uncommon in children and adolescents. Reproductive tract (Mullerian) 
anomalies causing an accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina, uterus, and 
fallopian tubes represent an unusual extraspinal cause of low-back pain. The 
accumulation of blood in these cavities is termed hematocolpos, hematometra, and 
hematosalpinx. Amenorrhea with cyclic lower abdominal pain and a presenting 
pelvic mass are the usual presenting features. In the current report, we 
describe a case of an adolescent with low-back pain, positive straight leg 
raising test, and signs of L5 radiculopathy that were attributable to 
hematometra secondary to congenital partial absence of a vagina. This appears to 
be the first report of this type of presentation.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the interexaminer 
agreement of palpation for soft tissue and osseous pain along with visual 
observations in the lumbar spine. Second, the interexaminer agreement of 
dermothermograph and surface electromyographic (EMG) scans of the lumbar spine 
were assessed. Third, to perform these evaluations on symptomatic low back 
patients. Finally, the most reliable measurements were combined in a 
multidimensional index of segmental lumbar abnormality, which was assessed for 
interexaminer agreement.
DESIGN: This is an interexaminer reliability study of commonly used palpatory 
and instrumentation procedures used to assess lumbar segmental abnormality.
SETTING: This study was conducted at Pain Assessment and Rehabilitation Center 
(PARC) and the Center for Clinical Studies (CCS) at Northwestern College of 
Chiropractic.
PATIENTS: The patients involved in this study were symptomatic at the time of 
examination. The patients were recruited from the CCS clinic and PARC.
RESULTS: Palpation for osseous pain produced kappa coefficients ranging from 
.48-.90. Palpation for soft tissue pain produced kappa coefficients that ranged 
from .40-.79 and the kappas for visual observation ranged from .34-.84. The 
dermothermograph and surface EMG scanner were also assessed with the kappa 
coefficient for their reliability in assessing lumbar segmental abnormality. The 
kappa coefficients ranged from -.13 to .59 for the surface EMG and 0- .63 for 
the dermothermograph measurements. Intraclass correlation coefficients for the 
surface EMG measurements ranged from .20-.55 and the dermothermograph 
measurements ranged from .01-.55. Palpation for pain (osseous and soft tissue) 
and visual observation were included in the multidimensional index of 
abnormality. The interexaminer agreement of detecting a manipulable lesion was 
evaluated by designating a lesion present with a positive two out of three 
tests. Kappa coefficients for the multidimensional index of lumbar abnormality 
ranged from a low of .05 to a high of .52.
CONCLUSIONS: Palpation for pain (osseous and soft tissue) and visual observation 
produced good to excellent interexaminer agreement and were included in the 
multidimensional index of abnormality. The interexaminer agreement of surface 
EMG scans and dermothermograph measurements were poor and considered to be 
clinically unacceptable, thus were not included in the multidimensional index. 
Palpation for pain is the only spinal assessment procedure to show consistent 
reliability in a number of studies.

We describe twenty one cases of tumoral metastasis on the vertebral column 
simulating initially discal herniation. All of them presented sciatica as a 
primary clinical manifestation of the malignant tumor. We describe here the 
differential diagnosis with other pathologies and the different outcome, like 
the poor response to regular treatment, alteration of the normal status, and 
alteration of the laboratory data. The radiologic findings and the laboratory 
abnormalities found in the emergency analysis should induce us to do more 
complete studies of the patient aimed to identify an underlying tumoral 
pathology.

180 degrees SPECT of the spine in patients with low back pain. Comparison with 
360 degrees acquisition.

Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Single-photon emission computed tomography has been proven to detect more 
abnormalities than planar bone scintigraphy in patients with low back pain 
(LBP). Both 180 degrees and 360 degrees acquisitions were performed in 24 
patients with LBP to determine whether the shorter 180 degrees posterior SPECT 
is as accurate for abnormality detection as 360 degrees acquisition. The 
vertebral bodies and posterior elements of 193 vertebrae were scored on a 
five-point score (1 = normal, 5 = abnormal), independently by three experienced 
physicians, on three separate reconstructed image sets: standard, filtered, back 
projection 360 degrees acquisition, distance-weighted 360 degrees acquisition, 
and standard, filtered, back projection 180 degrees acquisition. With one 
exception, no statistically significant difference in score was found between 
180 degrees and 360 degrees images. For one observer, the mean score of the 
posterior elements was higher on 180 degrees compared to 360 degrees standard 
images. These results indicate that 180 degrees acquisition SPECT may be used 
for abnormality detection in patients with LBP.

[Spinal stenosis. A review].

[Article in Danish]

Pedersen B, Kryger AI.

Spinal stenosis is characterized by a broad spectrum of symptoms which are often 
vague. Therefore, patients suffering from this condition are typically seen by 
various specialists over a long period of time. Among the symptoms are various 
degrees of low back pain, neurogenic claudication, parasthesias, muscle weakness 
and reflex abnormalities. When spinal stenosis is suspected, CT-scanning seems 
to visualise stenosis well. Because the localisation of the stenosis is often 
unknown, myelography is still the first choice. CT-scanning can then provide 
supplementary information regarding the specific location. MR-scanning is not as 
yet used as a routine procedure, but will in time replace both procedures. 
Conservative treatment consisting in analgesics and physiotherapy is sufficient 
in some cases. When conservative treatment is not enough, surgical intervention 
consisting in decompression by broad laminectomy is performed. Fusion is 
performed when there are signs of vertebral instability or in young patients. 
Operational results are often good. Failure is seen following insufficient 
decompression.

Detection of multiple myeloma involving the spine: efficacy of fat-suppression 
and contrast-enhanced MR imaging.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of fat-suppressed sequences and 
contrast-enhanced MR imaging for the detection of focal spinal lesions caused by 
multiple myeloma, we obtained MR images in 32 patients with newly diagnosed 
myeloma who had back pain.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients had biopsy-proved myeloma and had MR imaging 
at the painful level of the spine. Spin-echo T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and short 
TI inversion-recovery (STIR) images; dynamic ultrafast low-angle shot 
(turbo-FLASH) images after IV injection of a bolus of paramagnetic contrast 
material; and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were obtained. We 
qualitatively compared the signal intensities and contrast enhancement of focal 
lesions with those of the surrounding vertebral bodies.
RESULTS: Multiple lesions were detected in all but two of the 32 patients. On 
T2-weighted and STIR images, all lesions had homogeneously high signal 
intensity. On T1-weighted images, the lesions were visible as hypointense areas 
compared with surrounding bone in all except four patients, in whom the lesions 
were isointense or hyperintense. All tumor nodules enhanced on turbo-FLASH 
images obtained in the arterial phase. No additional lesions were seen on STIR 
or contrast-enhanced images. MR findings resulted in a change in the staging of 
the disease in one patient and led to prompt treatment in five patients with 
epidural involvement.
CONCLUSION: MR imaging appears to be helpful in detecting spinal involvement in 
patients with multiple myeloma. The diagnosis of spinal lesions is best achieved 
by using either fat-suppressed or T2-weighted images. Although myeloma lesions 
enhanced in all patients, contrast material appears to be of no value for the 
detection of additional lesions.

Paraspinal mapping: quantified needle electromyography in lumbar radiculopathy.

Haig AJ(1), Talley C, Grobler LJ, LeBreck DB.

Author information:
(1)Center for Rehabilitation Services, Theda Clark Regional Medical Center, 
Neenah, WI 54956.

In the diagnosis of low back pain, the presence of a high percentage of false 
positive findings on radiologic imaging studies has lead to a more definitive 
role for electrodiagnosis as a confirmatory test. The paraspinal muscles are a 
crucial part of the electrodiagnostic examination for radiculopathy. To date, no 
technique for paraspinal evaluation has been validated. Based on previously 
documented anatomical techniques, we have designed a method of paraspinal 
examination termed "paraspinal mapping" (PM). Electromyographic (EMG) needles 
are placed in five carefully chosen locations and inserted in multiple 
directions. Individual scores for these insertions are added to determine a 
total PM sensitivity score. The first 50 studies using PM were compared to 
peripheral EMG, imaging studies, and pain drawings. Results indicate that the 
technique is easy to perform. Sensitivity scores relate well with these tests. 
In this limited and uncontrolled population, PM had higher sensitivity for 
abnormalities than either peripheral EMG or imaging studies. Because of the 
anatomical validity of PM, future studies may show it to be useful in localizing 
the level of radiculopathy independently from peripheral EMG, and to support 
clinical findings and imaging studies.

The personnel at a geriatric hospital were randomized into two groups. One group 
was allowed to exercise during working hours to improve back muscle strength, 
endurance, and coordination. The other group did not participate in the exercise 
program and received no further advice or information. After 13 months, the 
training group had increased back muscle strength. One subject had been absent 
from work 28 days in the training group whereas 12 subjects had been absent 155 
days from work because of low back pain in the control group (P < 0.004). The 
back pain complaints and intensity of back pain in the training group also 
decreased in a statistically significant way. Every hour spent by the 
physiotherapist on the training group reduced the work absence among the 
participants by 1.3 days, resulting in a cost/benefit ratio greater than 10.

Correlates of myoelectric asymmetry detected in low back pain patients using 
hand-held post-style surface electromyography.

Leach RA(1), Owens EF Jr, Giesen JM.

Author information:
(1)FICC, Starkville, MS 39759.

OBJECTIVE: Paraspinal surface electromyographic (SEMG) scanning, utilizing 
post-style hand-held electrodes, was conducted to determine the usefulness of 
the technique as an assessment for myoelectric indicators of low back pain 
(LBP). A secondary objective was to correlate myoelectric abnormalities with 
other known outcome measures of the manipulable lesion.
DESIGN: Blinded SEMG assessments with the patients standing upright, fully 
flexed and extended at the trunk, and measures of pressure pain thresholds (PPT) 
were made after four tests administered by another examiner.
SETTING: The research was conducted on patients in a private chiropractic 
practice.
PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 10 of the practitioner's most acute LBP 
patients without neurological deficit were asked to participate and none 
refused. Six patients without recent LBP volunteered as controls.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preset myoelectric indicators included: thoracolumbar 
asymmetry (T-L/A: first seen in an earlier pilot study), loss of 
flexion/relaxation (F/R) at L3, contralateral responsivity (increased 
myoelectric activity opposite the side of leg pain) and right/left asymmetry 
(R-L/A) at L3.
RESULTS: Significant differences between groups were seen in T-L/A (p = .04) and 
R-L/A [data averaged from three postures (p = .04)], and robust group 
differences were seen in F/R (p = .011 right; p = .026 left). Contralateral 
responsivity was not significant. Loss of F/R was the only indicator that 
correlated with diminished PPT (r = .52 right; r = .46 left) and with Oswestry 
disability (r = .42), and that negatively correlated, as expected, with straight 
leg raising (r = -.50 right; r = -.74 left).
CONCLUSIONS: Results support use of the technique to detect muscle dysfunction 
related to LBP. Further research of SEMG correlations with measures of the 
manipulable lesion is warranted.

Relationship between electromyography and computed tomography in the evaluation 
of low back pain.

(1)Department of Rehabilitation, Yonsei University Medical College of Medicine, 
Seoul, Korea.

In a group of 109 patients with low back pain, the electromyographic(EMG) 
findings were compared with computed tomographic (CT) findings. There were 64 
(58.7%) patients who had abnormal EMG results combined with abnormal CT 
findings. 11 (10.1%) cases had abnormal EMG and normal CT findings, another 11 
(10.1%) patients had abnormal CT and normal EMG findings. 33 patients underwent 
operation; nerve root compressions were confirmed in all those with abnormal EMG 
findings, and 32 of those with abnormal CT findings. Among 33 surgical cases, 24 
(72.7%) patients had abnormal EMG findings in both paralumbar and lower 
extremity muscles. In 9 (27.3%) patients there was evidence of abnormal EMG 
findings in the paralumbar muscles only. Among 46 who had abnormal EMG findings 
in paralumbar and lower limb muscles, 44 (95.6%) patients had combined CT 
abnormalities, and in the remaining 2 patients, nerve root 'compression was 
confirmed by surgery in 1 case and by myelogram in the other. In 29 cases with 
abnormal EMG findings in the paralumbar muscles only, 20 (69.0%) patients had 
combined CT abnormalities. In comparing normal versus abnormal EMG findings of 
the paralumbar muscles only, a significantly higher percentage of abnormal CT 
results were found among the abnormal EMG findings. These results indicate that 
abnormal EMG findings in both the paralumbar and lower limb muscles, strongly 
suggests the presence of nerve root compression. In cases where there are 
abnormal EMG findings in the paralumbar muscles only, it is recommended that CT 
scan must be done for the correct diagnosis of low back pain.

The role of SPECT in the evaluation of skeletal trauma.

Murray IP(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney NSW, 
Australia.

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has, in the last decade, 
established a critical role in routine diagnosis. Skeletal scintigraphy 
exemplifies the impact in improving detection of lesions by delineation of their 
site and size. The advantage of minimizing the superimposed radioactivity from 
overlying and underlying structures is typified by the readiness with which 
avascular necrosis of the femoral head can be identified by removal of the 
surrounding hyperaemia which masks the classical photopaenia. However, the 
ability to achieve an accurate image at a plane at a prescribed depth is most 
characteristically shown by the study of a vertebra, a bone of irregular contour 
and subject to a variety of pathological disorders at different sites within it. 
The various focal abnormalities resulting from these can be localized exactly, 
readily distinguishing, for example, those in the body from those in the natural 
arch. In particular, the alterations resulting from trauma, such as pars 
interarticularis stress fracture, are readily seen. Consequently SPECT has an 
indispensable role in the investigation and management of low back pain. 
However, the ability of SPECT to delineate abnormal accumulation has provided a 
new approach to the evaluation of knee pain, especially when acute such as that 
resulting from athletic injury, since the identification of the presence or 
absence of focal abnormalities can be critical to patient management. The 
frequency of these various disorders in which SPECT is so useful explains why 
the procedure has become such a routine high-volume examination is so many 
departments.

A randomized double-blind trial of dextrose-glycerine-phenol injections for 
chronic, low back pain.

93102-1239.

This randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of injections of a 
dextrose-glycerine-phenol connective tissue proliferant into the posterior 
ligaments, fascia, and joint capsules to treat chronic low back pain. 
Seventy-nine patients with chronic low back pain that had failed to respond to 
previous conservative care were randomly assigned to receive a double-blind 
series of six injections at weekly intervals of either Xylocaine/saline solution 
or Xylocaine/proliferant into the posterior sacroiliac and interspinous 
ligaments, fascia, and joint capsules of the low back from L4 to the sacrum. 
Patients were observed with a visual analog, disability, and pain grid scores, 
and with objective computerized triaxial tests of lumbar function for 6 months 
following conclusion of injections. Pretreatment imaging tests with either 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans were 
performed in all patients. Thirty of the 39 patients randomly assigned to the 
proliferant group achieved a 50% or greater diminution in pain or disability 
scores at 6 months compared to 21 of 40 in the group receiving lidocaine (p = 
0.042). Subjective parameters measured at 6 months posttreatment improved (p < 
0.001) overall in both the treatment and control group compared to baseline. 
Improvements in visual analog (p = 0.056), disability (p = 0.068), and pain grid 
scores (p = 0.025) were greater in the proliferant group. Objective testing of 
range of motion, isometric strength, and velocity of movement showed significant 
improvements in both groups following treatment but did not favor either group. 
The MRI and CT scans showed significant abnormalities in both groups, but these 
did not correlate with subjective complaints and were not predictive of response 
to treatment.

Translumbar aortography: experience with a steerable pigtail catheter.

(1)Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Toronto Hospital, Ont.

The authors have designed a new coaxial system for translumbar aortography and 
studies of the pelvis and the legs from low or high aortic puncture sites. A no. 
4 French pigtail catheter with a maximum flow rate of 18 mL/s is mounted 
coaxially on a 32-cm-long, 20-gauge, thin-walled, two-part needle. The needle 
cannula accepts a guide wire of diameter 0.021 in (0.53 mm), over which the 
catheter can be advanced craniad for aortography or caudad for arteriography of 
the leg. After the first injection of contrast agent, the catheter can usually 
be easily redirected to complete the study. Such studies were successfully 
completed in 73 of 79 consecutive patients; the aorta could not be cannulated in 
2, and the catheter could not be redirected in 4. The sole complications were 
asymptomatic extravasation of the contrast agent in one patient and moderately 
severe back pain that resolved spontaneously in another. The authors describe 
the technique, as well as variations that have been developed to overcome aortic 
abnormalities.

Cases of half sister and brother with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in whom drug 
therapy with salazosulfapyridine (SASP) showed excellent effect were reported. A 
31 year-old female and her 28 year-old brother visited the out-patient clinic 
because of low back pain which lasted for the past 14 and 9 years, respectively. 
HLA examination revealed positive B27 antigen, X-ray and CT examination 
clarified sacroiliitis (grade III) in both patients. The diagnosis of AS was 
made and drug therapy with several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was 
started, but had little effects in both patients. After combination therapy with 
2 g/day of SASP and 20 mg/day of tenoxicam, both clinical and laboratory 
abnormalities disappeared within a month. It is well known that AS has 
hereditary characteristic, nevertheless there were only a couple of case reports 
which showed familial occurrence of AS and there was no report showing the 
effectiveness of SASP for the drug therapy of AS in Japan. The patients reported 
here were the first cases with AS occurred in sister and brother in Japan. We 
emphasized SASP might be a drug which is useful for the treatment of AS.

It has been reported that plasma fibrinolytic activity is abnormal in some 
patients with chronic low back pain. In an attempt to confirm this finding we 
studied 22 patients with chronic mechanical low back pain and compared them with 
18 healthy controls who denied symptoms of back pain. Factors known to interfere 
with plasma fibrinolysis such as age, weight, seasonal and diurnal variation, 
exercise, smoking and drugs were controlled as far as possible. Plasma 
fibrinogen was significantly higher (2.8 versus 2.3 g/l, P < 0.005) in patients 
than in controls, but there were no significant differences in the median plasma 
concentrations of euglobulin clot lysis time, fibrin plate lysis area, 
plasminogen, alpha-2-antiplasmin, tissue plasminogen activator activity, and 
antigen, tissue plasminogen activator inhibition and plasminogen activator 
inhibitor-1 antigen level. The results fail to confirm abnormalities of plasma 
fibrinolytic activity in a group of unselected cases of chronic low back pain.

Surgical treatment of Bertolotti's syndrome. Follow-up of 16 patients.

We surgically treated 16 patients with Bertolotti's syndrome (chronic, 
persistent low back pain and radiographically diagnosed transitional lumbar 
vertebra). Eight had posterolateral fusion and another eight resection of the 
transitional articulation. Thirteen patients had in addition to the chronic low 
back pain, suffered from repeated episodes or chronic sciatica. In six cases 
with resection treatment, local injections were administered at the transitional 
articulation before deciding for resection of the transitional joint; each 
patient reported transient relief of pain, while this preoperative test did not 
correlate with successful outcome of treatment. Six patients had to be treated 
with second operations. Ten of the 16 operatively treated patients showed 
improvement of the low back pain, and this result was similar in the group 
treated with fusion and in that treated with resection. Seven had no low back 
pain at follow-up, and the improvement according to the Oswestry pain scale was 
similar in the two groups, and statistically significant. Eleven patients still 
had persisting episodes of sciatica (versus 13 preoperatively). The average 
disability according to the Oswestry total disability scale was 30%, 
corresponding with moderate outcome, and both operatively treated groups did 
equally well. At follow-up the first disc above the fused segments was found to 
be degenerated in seven out of eight cases, and in the group treated with 
resection the first disc above the transitional vertebra was degenerated in five 
cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Two cases of congenital defects of transverse processes of lumbar spine causing 
lumbalgia are described. The first one was produced by direct contact of the 
elongated processes with subsequent pseudoarthrosis. Hypertrophied processes 
caused stenosis around intervertebral foramen and irritated posterior neural 
branch in the second case. Surgical resection of the hypertrophied transverse 
processes has brought the cure.

Lumbosacral spine imaging: physioanatomic method.

Luers PR(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City.

Noninvasive evaluation of low back and leg pain has progressed rapidly over the 
past decade. The development of computed tomography, single-photon 
emission-computed tomographic bone scan, and magnetic resonance imaging has 
markedly increased diagnostic accuracy in detecting pathologic conditions. With 
this increased accuracy has come recognition of a 50% prevalence of underlying 
abnormalities in patients between 20 and 60 years old who have no symptoms. When 
such patients have a back injury, subsequent imaging will show in half of the 
population studied abnormalities that are not related to an acute injury. 
Degeneration of the spine progresses in all patients throughout their lifetime, 
and nearly all of the population will have back discomfort at some time. 
Political- and judicial-based compensation for back injuries related to 
accidents and on-the-job injuries provides an incentive for patients not to 
improve on therapy and to exaggerate symptoms, further complicating the clinical 
evaluation of their condition. The goal of physioanatomic noninvasive and 
invasive imaging evaluation presented in the following chapters is to increase 
specificity by differentiating pain generators from asymptomatic underlying 
pathologic conditions. When used with intensive conservative management and 
psychologic testing, this physioanatomic approach has resulted in much better 
treatment outcomes in our experience. The physioanatomic approach is quite 
simple, consisting of rigorous correlation of pathologic changes demonstrated by 
noninvasive imaging modalities (computed tomography, single-photon 
emission-computed tomographic bone scan, and magnetic resonance), or invasive 
modalities (diskography-enhanced computed tomography, nerve root block and facet 
block) with the patient's symptoms to evaluate whether the symptoms and the 
pathologic lesion are concordant or discordant. Patient symptoms and history are 
evaluated by use of a pain drawing and information sheet. The patient's pain 
pattern is categorized into a nonspecific pattern or into one of four 
recognizable pathway patterns (radicular, dorsal ramus, polyneuropathy, and 
sympathetic). Because each spinal lesion is typically manifested primarily via 
one of the four symptom pathways, the distribution of expected symptoms from 
each pathologic feature can be compared with the patient's pain drawing, and an 
assessment of the significance of imaged lesions can be made. The patient's 
presenting symptoms are also used to determine the most cost-effective and 
efficacious use of initial diagnostic imaging evaluation. In a minority of 
patients the findings on noninvasive imaging either will not correlate with the 
patient's symptoms or will demonstrate multiple abnormalities that could account 
for the patient's symptoms. In these patients, invasive techniques are extremely 
helpful in defining a pain generator or pain generators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

The identification of spinal pathology in chronic low back pain using single 
photon emission computed tomography.

Ryan RJ(1), Gibson T, Fogelman I.

Author information:
(1)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.

Bone scintigraphy with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) offers 
improved lesion detection and localization when compared to conventional planar 
imaging. The SPECT findings were investigated in 80 consecutive patients (aged 
18-70 years, median 44) referred to a rheumatology outpatient clinic with low 
back pain persisting for more than 3 months. Lesions of the lumbar spine were 
demonstrated in 60% of patients using SPECT but in only 35% with planar imaging. 
Fifty-one per cent of all lesions were only detected by SPECT, and lesions 
visualized on SPECT could be precisely localized to the vertebral body, or 
different parts of the posterior elements. Fifty per cent of lesions involved 
the facetal joints of which almost 60% were identified on SPECT alone. X-rays of 
the lumbar spine, with posterior oblique views, failed to demonstrate 
abnormalities corresponding to almost all SPECT posterior element lesions 
although it identified abnormalities corresponding to over 60% of anterior SPECT 
lesions. Computed tomography (CT) was performed in 30 patients with a SPECT 
lesion and sites of facetal joint activity corresponded to facetal 
osteoarthritis in 82%. It is concluded that bone scintigraphy with SPECT in 
patients with chronic low back pain demonstrates many lesions not seen with 
either X-ray or conventional planar imaging. In addition anatomical localization 
is greatly enhanced with bone SPECT. The technique offers improved diagnosis in 
a group of patients often difficult to evaluate, and in particular a means of 
detecting apophyseal joint pathology which may be responsive to treatment.

Congenital absence of lumbosacral articular process: report of three cases.

Ikeda K(1), Nakayama Y, Ishii S.

Author information:
(1)Kansai-Denryoku Hospital, Osaka, Japan.

Defective anomaly of the articular process of the lumbosacral region in three 
young women is reported. One had a bilateral defect at the lower facet of L1 
with defect at L5 right lower and S1 right upper facets. Another had bilateral 
defects at L5 lower facets, and the third had a defect at the left lower facet 
of L5 with other anomalies of the lamina. Based on classification of 37 
anomalies including those previously reported in the literature, it is concluded 
that unilateral defect at the lumbosacral apophyseal joint involving both upper 
and lower facets is the most common anomaly. The pathogenesis of all anomalies 
is apparently complex. The intervertebral instability caused by these defects 
may provoke occasional low-back pain, especially in younger persons with a 
unilateral L5/S1 anomaly.

A 65-year-old female suffering from lumbago, headache, and hypertension had been 
treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antihypertensive 
drugs. On June 13, 1990, 2 weeks after the commencement of loxoprofen 
administration, she developed cough and low grade fever. She was treated with 
antibiotics and NSAIDs without improvement. Laboratory data showed marked 
eosinophilia (2200/mm3), elevation of IgE (3090 IU/ml), and liver dysfunction. 
Her chest X-ray revealed no active lesion, but the percentage of eosinophils in 
BALF was elevated (38%). Because drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia was 
suspected, all drugs were discontinued. Her symptoms improved and the 
abnormalities of laboratory data normalized. The lymphocyte stimulation test was 
weakly positive with three NSAIDs (loxoprofen, pranoprofen, and alminoprofen). 
The challenge test by loxoprofen reproduced eosinophilia and liver dysfunction, 
suggesting that she had loxoprofen-induced eosinophilic pneumonia. To our 
knowledge, this is the first reported case of loxoprofen-induced lung injury.

Management of herniated intervertebral disks during saturation dives: a case 
report.

Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.

During research saturation dives at 5.0 and 5.5 atm abs, 2 divers developed an 
acute herniation of the nucleus pulposus of the L5-S1 intervertebral disk. In 
both cases the pain was severe enough to require intravenous morphine or 
intramuscular meperidine. Although the symptoms presented by these divers are 
frequently considered to be an indication for immediate surgical consultation, 
we decided that emergency decompression posed an unacceptable risk that 
decompression sickness (DCS) would develop in the region of acute inflammation. 
In both cases strict bedrest and medical therapy were performed at depth. In the 
first case, 12 h was spent at depth before initiating a standard U.S. Navy 
saturation decompression schedule with the chamber partial pressure of oxygen 
elevated to 0.50 atm abs. In the second case, a conservative He-N2-O2 trimix 
decompression schedule was followed to the surface. In both cases, no initial 
upward excursion was performed. The required decompression time was 57 h 24 min 
from 5.5 atm abs and 55 h 38 min from 5.0 atm abs. During the course of 
decompression, the first diver's neurologic exam improved and he required 
decreasing amounts of intravenous narcotic; we considered both to be evidence 
against DCS. The second diver continued to have pain and muscle spasm throughout 
decompression, however he did not develop motor, reflex, or sphincter 
abnormalities. Both divers have responded well to nonsurgical therapy.

Osteoarthritis of the facet joints and its role in low-back pain: evaluation 
with conventional tomography.

(1)Department of Radiology, University Hospitals KU Leuven, Belgium.

Thirty-seven patients with chronic low-back pain and an atypical irradiation to 
one or both legs were examined by conventional tomography of the facet joints. A 
disc herniation was excluded by computed tomography (CT) in 31 patients. The 
facet joints were considered normal in 4 patients. Four grades of facet joint 
disease were used to classify the pathological changes. Correlation of the 
radiological findings with the facet joint block by injection of a local 
anesthetic was obtained in 12 patients. It appears that conventional tomography 
is a very sensitive technique as it is possible to detect even discrete 
abnormalities of the facet joints. However, as it is time consuming and high in 
radiation dose, the examinations should be reserved for patients with a normal 
CT examination of the lumbar spine in whom there still remains a high suspicion 
of facet joint disease.

Epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of low back pain.

Borenstein D(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, George Washington University Medical Center, 
Washington, DC 20037.

New data concerning the epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, and 
treatment of low back pain have been reported over the past year. Low back pain 
remains an expensive health problem for our country costing an estimated 24 
billion dollars in direct medical expenses. The degeneration of intervertebral 
disks may be associated with the appearance of increased amounts of specific 
collagen types that are not present in normal disk specimens. In an important 
study of monozygotic twins, smoking was identified as an independent variable 
associated with advanced degeneration of intervertebral disks. Sacral 
insufficiency fractures are a significant cause of back pain particularly in 
elderly individuals with predisposing disorders and medications. Radiographic 
techniques continue to improve and offer earlier detection of the anatomic 
abnormalities associated with clinical disorders including inflammatory 
myelitis. Epidural corticosteroid injections are helpful for decreasing symptoms 
of radiculopathy, but the injections may only be placed in the correct location 
in the epidural space 50% of the time unless corroborated by radiographic 
techniques. Chiropractors suggest that manipulation therapy is cost effective 
for treatment of low back pain in comparison with therapies given by physicians.

Chronic low back pain: comparison of bone SPECT with radiography and CT.

Ryan PJ(1), Evans PA, Gibson T, Fogelman I.

Author information:
(1)Department of Rheumatology, Guy's Hospital, London, England.

In patients with chronic low back pain, bone scintigraphy with single photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the lumbar spine allows identification 
of lesions not seen with planar imaging. In this study, findings from 
radiography, computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy with SPECT in 34 
patients with chronic back pain were examined to determine the nature and 
clinical relevance of the lesions. Twenty-seven patients had lesions at SPECT, 
of whom 24 (89%) had abnormalities at CT and 18 (67%) had abnormalities at 
radiography. SPECT allowed identification of 54 lesions, of which only 20 (37%) 
were detected with planar imaging. Forty-three (80%) SPECT lesions were located 
at the site of an abnormality also seen at CT and 20 (37%) at the site of an 
abnormality also seen at radiography. It was concluded that bone SPECT provides 
diagnostic information in chronic low back pain that is not available with 
radiography or planar imaging. The majority of lesions seen at SPECT 
corresponded to identifiable disease at CT.

Fatty acid composition of adipose tissue and serum micronutrients in relation to 
common rheumatic complaints in Swedish adults 50-70 years old.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, Malmö General Hospital, Sweden.

Biochemical markers of nutritional status, such as adipose tissue fatty acid 
composition and circulating levels of micronutrients, may reflect dietary 
habits, but may also be related to inflammatory activity. We examined the 
relationship between common rheumatic complaints such as osteo-arthrosis, 
arthralgia, tendinitis, low-back pain, and neck pain, and the composition of 
adipose tissue fatty acids, serum concentrations of retinol, ascorbic acid, 
alpha-tocopherol and selenium in 502, out of 900 randomly selected individuals 
50-70 years old. Compared with control subjects the rheumatic group as a whole 
(p less than 0.01) as well as subgroups like those with arthralgia (p less than 
0.01), subacromial shoulder pain (p less than 0.03), and low-back pain (p less 
than 0.05), had decreased proportions of adipose tissue arachidonic acid. The 
abnormalities correlated with the duration of the symptom-free period preceding 
adipose tissue sampling and could not be explained by the evaluation of possible 
confounding factors. Regarding other fatty acids and micronutrients there were 
no differences between symptomatic subjects and controls. One explanation for 
the low proportion of adipose tissue arachidonic acid may be increased 
eicosanoid production.

France.

An anatomical study of the lumbar apophyseal joints was carried out to 
facilitate recognition of facet joint lesions, which we now examine routinely by 
percutaneous arthrography. Special attention was given to the configuration of 
the different compartments of the joint space and to its relationships with the 
contents of the intervertebral foramen. The abnormalities seen on lumbar facet 
joint arthrography are very varied; two major groups should be stressed: 
synovial fringe hypertrophy and pseudodiverticular synovial ectasia. The 
percutaneous approach to lumbar facet joint arthrography allows it to be used a 
therapeutic measure, with injection of anti-inflammatory drugs into the joint 
space, the beneficial effects of which were confirmed in our series. The 
precision, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this outpatient technique 
justify and should encourage its more widespread application in the diagnosis 
and treatment of low back pain.

The therapeutic results were analysed in a group of 509 patients operated on for 
low back pain syndromes (after previous establishing of indications based on 
clinical examination and radiological investigations) with over 6 months of 
follow-up. The therapeutic results were compared with the observed symptoms and 
signs, neurological findings, age, duration of acute phase of the disease, 
surgical approach used, changes found during the operation, stability of the 
spine and type of its surgical immobilization. The therapeutic result depended 
mainly on the degree of neurological abnormalities before the operation, 
duration of the acute phase and operative findings as well as spinal stability. 
The operative approach and stabilization type, although influencing the result, 
were a consequence of the above factors.

Failed back surgery syndrome.

Long DM(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurological Surgery, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, 
Maryland.

The failed back or postlaminectomy syndrome is obviously multidimensional. 
Failure of therapy may result from structural abnormalities in the back, 
psychosocial influences, or a combination of both. The causes of back pain are 
largely unknown. Correlations with diagnostic studies are uncertain. The lack of 
precise diagnoses is reflected in a multiplicity of nonspecific treatments, 
mostly of unproven value. Our current disability-litigation system adds greatly 
to the problem. Patients are rewarded for nonfunction. Some physicians become 
advocates for patients, others for insurance carriers and employers. Decisions 
concerning appropriate treatment are often made by patients, attorneys, the 
disability determination system, employers, and judges for extraneous reasons, 
which include financial gain or personal bias and often reflect lack of current 
information. Even when correct decisions are made, there is a lack of adequate 
programs for diagnosis and comprehensive treatment of these individuals. The 
failed back syndrome is not likely to disappear quickly. Large numbers of these 
patients require care. The best available evaluation includes thorough, but not 
overly minute investigation using the best current imaging techniques. These 
studies combined with the history and physical examination should provide a 
reasonably accurate assessment of the patient's condition. Concomitant 
evaluation of psychosocial issues is mandatory, and those who treat these 
patients without understanding the importance of the various comorbidities 
discussed are likely to be detrimental. Reparative surgery has real, but limited 
use. Nerve root compression and instability are the only two conditions 
demonstrated to be correctable at the present time. However, even when a 
potentially remediable lesion is found, these patients should undergo a 
reasonable attempt at physical rehabilitation with attention to both local 
factors and general function. The best data available today suggest that most of 
the patients suffering from failed back syndrome are incapacitated by 
psychiatric, psychologic, and social/vocational factors, which relate to the 
back complaint only indirectly. Those currently suffering from this problem can 
be best treated by comprehensive programs that address these complex 
psychosocial issues. New additions to this category can be reduced by rigorous 
attention to physical abnormalities, so that surgery is undertaken only for 
clear indications, and appreciation of the importance of the psychologic aspects 
of disability from low back pain. The smaller group suffering principally from 
physical abnormalities can be improved by reparative surgery or pain-relieving 
procedures if intensive conservative rehabilitation efforts fail. All surgical 
procedures fail occasionally, and as long as there is a need for reparative 
surgery, some patients will fail to benefit or be worsened by the 
procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

This review discusses the indications, techniques, complications, and results of 
three percutaneous procedures used to evaluate and treat lower back pain: 
diskography, facet-joint injection, and epidural injection. Diskography, 
performed by injection of contrast medium into the nucleus pulposus, is a 
technique used to determine the cause of lower back pain in patients in whom 
findings on other imaging studies are normal or conflicting. Injection of 
steroids and anesthetic into the facet joints of the lumbar spine is useful to 
diagnose or treat patients with facet syndrome (back pain caused by 
abnormalities of the facet joints). Injection of steroids and anesthetic agents 
into the epidural space provides short-term relief, and can sometimes provide 
permanent relief, of lower back pain.

A case of mobile tumor of the cauda equina was presented with a brief review of 
factors relating to the mobility. A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital 
complaining of left lumbago aggravated by coughing or assuming the supine 
position. However, neurological examination failed to reveal any abnormalities. 
The initial myelography showed complete obstruction above the superior border of 
the L1 vertebra, while the second myelography showed the same obstruction, but 
it had moved upwards to the superior border of T12. Surgery revealed an elastic, 
soft tumor and cystic dilatation of the subarachnoid space above and below the 
tumor. The tumor was mobile but originated from a single elongated and tortuous 
nerve of the cauda equina. Pathologic examination revealed neurinoma.

In the cerebrospinal fluid (C.S.F.) of hundred patients suffering from lumbago 
we have studied the existence of cytobiochemical and cytoradiological 
correlations in order to confirm the demonstration of cytologic and biochemical 
signs of organicisty or seriousness of this frequent pathology. We have realized 
cytorachia, that is to say differential cells counts and formulas on C.S.F. 
samples after cytocentrifugation and staining associated with biochemical 
determinations. Cytologically 96% of C.S.F. samples had normal count but 67% of 
them had a disturbed formula often associated with hyperproteinorachia. We have 
found lymphocytes and histiomonocytes the normal cells of C.S.F. but also 
neutrophilic, eosinophilic and basophilic polymorphonuclears and above all 
leptomeningeal cells. A disturbed cytorachia is often related with a 
pathological radiological picture (68% of cases). A cytologic anomaly with 
hyperproteinorachia in the same C.S.F. sample seems to be a sign of seriousness 
and to reveal a resistance to medical treatment. A technical presentation of 
cytorachia and an attempt of physiopathological explanation of observed 
cytologic abnormalities are proposed.

The role of epidural fibrosis and defective fibrinolysis in the persistence of 
postlaminectomy back pain.

Cooper RG(1), Mitchell WS, Illingworth KJ, Forbes WS, Gillespie JE, Jayson MI.

Author information:
(1)Rheumatic Diseases Centre, University of Manchester, United Kingdom.

Clinical features, contrast-enhanced lumbar tomographic findings, and 
biochemical plasma fibrinolytic parameters were critically assessed in 70 
patients suffering severe, chronic postsurgical low-back and radicular pain to 
determine the cause of their persisting symptoms. Patients exhibited gross 
functional disability and significant impairment of plasma fibrinolytic 
activity, compared with 84 normal control subjects. This fibrinolytic defect 
appeared attributable to disproportionate increases in circulating plasminogen 
activator inhibitor-1 levels. Clinical features were slightly worse in patients 
with radiologic epidural fibrosis, whereas the frequency of radiologic 
abnormalities, including epidural fibrosis, was higher in patients with 
fibrinolytic abnormalities. The results, however, demonstrated no significant 
associations between patients' symptoms and signs and their biochemical and 
radiologic abnormalities.

(1)Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital, Boston.

The authors reviewed 1 year of experience with planar and single photon emission 
computed tomographic (SPECT) bone scintigraphy in 162 young patients with 
symptoms of low-back pain possibly related to stress injury to the pars 
interarticularis or spondylolysis. Planar scintigraphy and SPECT revealed no 
abnormality in 91 patients (56%). All abnormalities detected on planar images 
were also detectable with SPECT. SPECT showed an abnormal focus of radiotracer 
uptake in the lumbar spine in 71 patients (44%). In 32 of these 71 patients, 
these findings were also evident with planar scintigraphy. In 39 of these 71 
patients, use of SPECT. Correlation with contemporaneous radiographs was made in 
72 cases (including computed tomography in 10 cases). SPECT can be used to 
detect stress injury not seen with planar bone imaging or radiography and is 
recommended in evaluation of low-back pain in young athletes.

Low-back pain and disk degeneration in children: a case-control MR imaging 
study.

Tertti MO(1), Salminen JJ, Paajanen HE, Terho PH, Kormano MJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Turku, Finland.

Thirty-nine 15-year-old children with low-back pain (LBP) and 39 asymptomatic 
control children were selected from a population of 1,503 children of the same 
age for a magnetic resonance imaging study of the lumbar spine. Subjects with 
LBP were matched with control subjects by age, sex, and school class. Disk 
degeneration (DD) was present in 15 (38%) of the children with LBP and in 10 
(26%) of the control subjects. Lumbar degeneration was most frequently 
associated with disk protrusion and Scheuermann-type changes. Of assessed 
structural abnormalities (disk protrusion, Scheuermann-type changes, 
transitional vertebra, and disk space narrowing), only disk protrusion was more 
common in children of the LBP group than in control subjects. The authors 
conclude that DD is a frequent finding among children with LBP at the age of 15 
years. Asymptomatic (possibly physiologic) DD also is frequently found in 
children of this age. Whether DD associated with structural changes predisposes 
to low-back disorders can be confirmed only by means of a longitudinal follow-up 
study.

Facet tropism: comparison of plain film and computed tomography examinations.

Cox JM(1), Aspegren DD, Trier KK.

Author information:
(1)Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Indiana University, Purdue 
University, Fort Wayne 46805.

This study compares the findings of plain film X-ray and computed CT examination 
in the diagnosis of facet orientation and the presence of tropism. Twenty 
consecutive patients having lumbar disc disease with sciatica were studied 
utilizing plain X-ray as well as CT scanning. A chiropractic radiologist read 
the films to determine if facet facings were sagittally, semi-sagittally or 
coronally oriented on both CT and plain X-ray study. CT was accepted as the most 
accurate method to determine the true facet orientation, and plain X-ray 
interpretation of facet orientation was compared to the CT reading. There was a 
statistically significant relationship in diagnosing tropism between plain film 
X-ray and CT readings, with a predictive accuracy that ranged from 58-84% across 
the three segmental levels. However, the exact concordance of plain film X-ray 
and CT readings for right and left facet facings was very low. This raises the 
question of how the profession defines diagnostic accuracy.

Uterine incarceration during the third trimester: a rare complication of 
pregnancy.

Van Winter JT(1), Ogburn PL Jr, Ney JA, Hetzel DJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.

Uterine incarceration that manifests during the third trimester or at term is a 
serious and rare complication of pregnancy. The pregnant patient may complain of 
low-abdominal pain, low-back pain, urinary retention, and constipation, or the 
patient may be asymptomatic until labor begins. The diagnosis is difficult, and 
physical findings can be misleading. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance 
imaging can be helpful if the anteriorly displaced cervix is clearly depicted. 
If incarceration of the retroverted uterus persists until term, a cesarean 
section is necessary. Recurrent uterine incarceration has been reported; 
therefore, the patient should be monitored closely during subsequent 
pregnancies. Herein we describe three cases of uterine incarceration during the 
third trimester and review the literature with respect to incidence, 
differential diagnosis, management, and complications of this condition.

This study reports about 10 patients, with low back pain and sciatica caused by 
conjoined nerve roots. The described nerve root anomaly could produce sciatica 
even without the presence of a disc prolaps or another impingement. On computed 
tomography it is difficult to distinguish conjoined nerve roots from a disc 
prolaps. Two of these patients have been operated, eight of them have had 
conservative treatment. Our experiences show that the best results could be 
achieved with conservative treatment, especially with stabilising gymnastics and 
with transcutaneous nerve stimulation.

Low back pain: epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic evaluation, and therapy.

Borenstein D(1).

Author information:
(1)George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, D.C.

During the past year, investigations involving the etiology, diagnostic 
evaluation, and therapy of low back pain have reported interesting new data. The 
natural history of degenerative intervertebral disk disease may be explained by 
peripheral annular fiber injury that results in damage to the nucleus pulposus. 
Diurnal changes in patient clinical symptoms and signs may have a correlate in 
alteration of spinal mechanics that occurs during the course of a day. The 
diagnostic evaluation of low back pain continues to be revolutionized by 
magnetic resonance imaging. Although magnetic resonance imaging is able to 
detect specific lesions with greater sensitivity than other radiographic 
techniques, correlation between clinical symptoms and signs and anatomic 
abnormalities is essential for correct diagnosis. Therapeutic controversies 
continue concerning the efficacy of chiropractic intervention and transcutaneous 
electric nerve stimulation for low back pain patients. Microsurgical techniques 
for disk removal may prove to be associated with less morbidity than diskectomy 
with laminectomy, but require additional study.

Reliability of interpretation of plain lumbar spine radiographs in benign, 
mechanical low-back pain.

Author information:
(1)Department of Rheumatology, Ambroise Paré Hospital, Boulogne, France.

A study was conducted to investigate the variability of interpretation of plain 
lumbar spine radiographs by rheumatologists in benign low-back pain (LBP). 
Intra- and interobserver agreement in classifying the presence of primary 
radiologic abnormalities according to pre-established criteria was assessed by 
the Kappa statistic in 115 anteroposterior and lateral radiograms. A significant 
variability of interpretation was observed for many findings often considered 
important in benign LBP. Particularly, low levels of agreement were observed for 
apophyseal joint abnormalities. Schmorl's nodes, spondylolysis, and structural 
deviations. Elaboration and validation of better standardized criteria for the 
main radiologic abnormalities is needed to improve the reliability of 
interpretation of lumbar spine radiographs.

In 10 patients with severe, chronic low back pain, we studied the effect of 
steroid and local anesthetic infiltration of anomalous lumbosacral 
articulations, formed between a transitional lumbosacral vertebra and the 
sacrum. There was immediate total relief of pain in 8 patients, and in 1 patient 
immediate partial relief that became total after approximately 7 days. Five 
patients subsequently relapsed to their former pain level in periods ranging 
from 1 day to 12 weeks, 3 patients continued to report adequate partial pain 
relief after periods of 7 to 41 months, and 1 patient remained free from pain 2 
years after infiltration. IN some cases, infiltration of these articulations may 
be therapeutic, as well as diagnostic.

A 48-year-old woman was admitted in September 1987, because of lumbago and 
galactorrhea. Peripheral blood analysis showed neutrophilia and eosinophilia 
without abnormal lymphocytes. The antibody to adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) 
virus-associated antigen was detected and a hyperprolactinemia was observed. The 
blastogenic responses to PHA, ConA and PWM were lowered. Brain CT and MRI 
scannings showed no abnormalities in the hypophysis and hypothalamus, but 
abdomen CT revealed markedly enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Two months after 
the administration of OK432 and PSK, the lymph node swellings disappeared and 
the responses to PHA, ConA and PWM were normalized, but hyperprolactinemia and 
galactorrhea persisted. After four months of the remission period, the patient 
developed lymph node swellings again, and was diagnosed from the biopsy specimen 
of the retroperitoneal lymph node as having malignant lymphoma of diffuse mixed 
cell type. Southern blot analysis showed a monoclonal integration of HTLV-I 
proviral DNA. Despite repeated combination chemotherapies, she died of pneumonia 
in February 1989. Autopsy revealed marked infiltrations of lymphoma cells in the 
liver, spleen and lungs, but no abnormality accounting for hyperprolactinemia 
was detected in the suprasellar regions. This case was of interest in that 
immunotherapy was effective in achieving a remission and in normalizing 
immuno-parameters in ATLL.

Hematocolpos as a cause of back pain in premenarchal adolescents.

Letts M(1), Haasbeek J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, 
Canada.

Persistent low back pain in children demands thorough investigation. An unusual 
cause of such discomfort is hematocolpos secondary to imperforate hymen in 
premenarchal girls. Experience with four patients whose initial primary symptom 
was low back pain has been documented. All had large pelvic masses with greater 
than 400 ml of old blood being drained at hymenotomy in all patients. Irritation 
of the sacral plexus or nerve roots is postulated as a mechanism for the 
referred back pain. Hematocolpos should be included in the differential 
diagnosis of prepubertal girls who have low back pain.

tomography (CT) in 87% and myelography in 80%. IRT correlated with MRI in 94% of 
cases, and with CT in 87% of cases. Of 22 MRI positive disc and root cases, 21 
(95%) had significant leg abnormalities on IRT. All 19 cases with radicular 
involvement on CT and all 18 with radicular involvement on myelography 
demonstrated significant leg changes on IRT.

Lumbar discography followed by computed tomography. Refining the diagnosis of 
low-back pain.

Bernard TN Jr(1).

Author information:
(1)Hughston Orthopaedic Clinic, Columbus, Georgia.

Two hundred fifty patients with low-back pain who underwent lumbar discography 
followed by computed tomography (CT) are the subject of this prospective study. 
In 93% of the patients, these combined imaging techniques provided additional 
useful diagnostic information that affected patient management and the selection 
of treatment alternatives. Lumbar discography followed by CT proved valuable in 
determining the significance of equivocal or multiple level abnormalities, 
determining the type of disc herniation, defining surgical options, and 
evaluating the previously operated spine. In 94% of patients who had surgery, 
CT-discography correctly predicted the type of disc herniation as protruded, 
extruded, sequestrated, or internally disrupted. Computed tomography-discography 
may be more sensitive that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the early stages 
of disc degeneration because 18 of 177 discs with a normal T2-weighted image 
were discographically abnormal and the CT-discogram revealed annular tears or 
radial fissuring. The radiographic morphology of the normal herniated and 
degenerative lumbar discs shown by CT-discography gives unique insight into the 
pathogenesis of disc degeneration. The complications that followed the 750 
discograms were one case of urticaria and one disc space infection. Even with 
the availability of high resolution CT and MRI, lumbar discography remains the 
only pain provocation challenge to the lumbar disc.

Herniated lumbar intervertebral disk.

Deyo RA(1), Loeser JD, Bigos SJ.

Author information:
(1)University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle.

Comment in
    Ann Intern Med. 1990 Aug 15;113(4):330-1.

Low back pain is common, but a herniated intervertebral disk is the cause in 
only a small percentage of cases. Most symptomatic disk herniations result in 
clinical manifestations (pain, reflex loss, muscle weakness) that resolve with 
conservative therapy, and only 5% to 10% of patients require surgery. Sciatica 
is usually the first clue to disk herniation, but sciatica may be mimicked by 
other disorders that cause radiating pain. Because more than 95% of lumbar disk 
herniations occur at the L4-5 or L5-S1 levels, the physical examination should 
focus on abnormalities of the L5 and S1 nerve roots. Plain radiography is not 
useful in diagnosing disk herniation, but more sophisticated imaging 
(myelography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) should 
generally be delayed until a patient is clearly a surgical candidate. 
Conservative therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, brief bed 
rest (often for less than 1 week), early progressive ambulation, and reassurance 
about a favorable prognosis. Muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics have a 
limited role, and their use should be strictly time-limited. Conventional 
traction and corsets are probably ineffective. Except for patients with the 
cauda equina syndrome, surgery is generally appropriate only when there is a 
combination of definite disk herniation shown by imaging, a corresponding 
syndrome of sciatic pain, a corresponding neurologic deficit, and a failure to 
respond to 6 weeks of conservative therapy.

Abnormal magnetic-resonance scans of the lumbar spine in asymptomatic subjects. 
A prospective investigation.

Author information:

Center, Washington, D.C.

We performed magnetic resonance imaging on sixty-seven individuals who had never 
had low-back pain, sciatica, or neurogenic claudication. The scans were 
interpreted independently by three neuro-radiologists who had no knowledge about 
the presence or absence of clinical symptoms in the subjects. About one-third of 
the subjects were found to have a substantial abnormality. Of those who were 
less than sixty years old, 20 per cent had a herniated nucleus pulposus and one 
had spinal stenosis. In the group that was sixty years old or older, the 
findings were abnormal on about 57 per cent of the scans: 36 per cent of the 
subjects had a herniated nucleus pulposus and 21 per cent had spinal stenosis. 
There was degeneration or bulging of a disc at at least one lumbar level in 35 
per cent of the subjects between twenty and thirty-nine years old and in all but 
one of the sixty to eighty-year-old subjects. In view of these findings in 
asymptomatic subjects, we concluded that abnormalities on magnetic resonance 
images must be strictly correlated with age and any clinical signs and symptoms 
before operative treatment is contemplated.

[Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal ependymoma presenting findings 
mimicking subacute meningitis].

[Article in Japanese]

Matsushima K(1), Shinohara Y, Takizawa S, Yamamoto M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Tokai University, School of Medicine.

A case of spinal ependymoma showing spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage with findings 
mimicking subacute meningitis is reported. A 33-year-old man was admitted to our 
hospital because of headache, low back pain and low grade fever on June 8, 1982. 
Ten years ago he had experienced an episode of abrupt onset lumbago and 
headache. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was suspected because of bloody cerebrospinal 
fluid, but cerebral angiography failed to demonstrate any abnormalities. On 
admission physical examination revealed nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign and 
percussion tenderness on 5th lumbar spine. Lumbar puncture showed bloody 
cerebrospinal fluid. Cell counts were 217 per cubic millimeter (neutrophil: 
lymphocyte = 27.73), protein was 396 mg/dl and sugar level was 18 mg/dl. 
Myelography showed an intradural extramedullary tumor at the spinal level of 
L1-L2. Spinal MRI and CT scan also demonstrated a spinal tumor at the same 
level. Laminectomy and total resection of the spinal tumor were performed and a 
diagnosis of myxopapillary ependymoma was made histologically. He was discharged 
about a month later without any neurological deficits. The development of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal tumor is rare. There are about 50 cases of 
spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal tumor in the literature, including 
three cases in Japan. Two cases presenting CSF findings mimicking bacterial 
meningitis have been reported in the literature, but there is no report of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal tumor that presents findings mimicking 
subacute meningitis similar to our case. From these results, it is suggested 
that subarachnoid hemorrhage due to spinal ependymoma may reveal various CSF 
findings. In cases suggesting bacterial or subacute meningitis with bloody CSF 
and acute onset, the possibility of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to 
rupture of a spinal tumor, especially ependymoma, should be considered.

Spread of local anaesthetic solutions following sacral extradural (caudal) 
block: influence of posture.

Williams NE(1), Hardy PA, Evans AF.

Author information:
(1)Whiston Hospital, Prescot, Merseyside, England.

Extradural sacral (caudal) block was performed in 17 cases (14 patients) of 
chronic low back pain. In each case 22 ml of a bupivacaine/methylprednisolone 
solution incorporating a radioopaque dye was injected over a 2-min period. 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive the injection in the horizontal 
position or with 15 degrees head-up or head-down tilt applied to the operating 
table. Results indicate that analgesia is usually more localised than spread of 
solution determined by x-ray evidence and that higher levels of analgesia are 
achieved in patients in the head-up position. Possible causes are the differing 
distribution characteristics of the constituents of the solution and the 
gravitational effects of posture on cerebrospinal fluid mechanics. Technical 
problems associated with obesity, congenital abnormalities, vascular uptake of 
solution, and delayed spread of the injectant due to adhesions are discussed.

31.11%), near roots (26.66%), two roots in same foreman (20%), anastomosis 
between roots (11.11%), double roots (4.44%), branch root and combined type 
(6.66%). The rate of finding of NRA by operation was 0.34%, that was far lower 
than by myelography and autopsy. Careful exploration can increase the finding 
rate. NRA can induce backache and sciatica by itself. Its clinical 
distinguishing features were severe symptoms, compression of multiple nerve 
roots slight or negative Lasegue sign. The principle of treatment of NRA was 
adequate decompression, but should be careful to avoid injury of displaced and 
tensile nerve roots. In this paper, the matters needing attention in operation 
was discussed as well.

Functional radiography of the lumbar spine.

Friberg O(1).

Author information:
(1)Research Institute of Military Medicine, Helsinki, Finland.

Functional methods utilising the effects of gravity on the upright lordotic 
spine were developed for both static and dynamic radiography. Static standing 
orthoradiography of the lumbar spine and weight-bearing joints of the lower 
extremities shows constitutional and functional abnormalities not visible in 
conventional recumbent radiography, e.g., postural scoliosis, hypo- or 
hyperlordosis, "kissing spine"-syndrome and signs of segmental instability. In 
dynamic traction-compression radiography segmental instability is provoked by 
axial traction and compression of the spine. With this method translatory 
instability of 5 to 15 mm was found in about half of the patients with lytic 
spondylolisthesis of L5 for which flexion-extension radiography had consistently 
failed to produce any abnormal movement. The amount of anterior 
spondylolisthetic and posterior retro-olisthetic instability correlated 
significantly with the severity of back pain symptoms, the degree of maximal 
static slip, however, being without significance. Functional radiography showed 
positive findings in most patients suffering from chronic low back pain of 
otherwise unknown aetiology.

Comment in
    Neurology. 1990 Mar;40(3 Pt 1):559-63.

We studied 27 normal subjects and 30 patients with low back pain to evaluate the 
diagnostic accuracy of thermography in the diagnosis of lumbosacral 
radiculopathy. Thermographic abnormality was defined as the presence of either 
interside temperature difference exceeding 3 standard deviations from the normal 
mean, or an abnormal heat pattern overlying the lumbosacral spine. In patients 
with clinically unequivocal radiculopathy, thermography and electrophysiologic 
study were similar in diagnostic sensitivity, and the 2 methods agreed on the 
presence or absence of abnormality in 71% of cases. However, the thermographic 
findings had limited localizing value. Relative limb warming was often seen in 
patients with acute denervation on EMG, and limb cooling in those with more 
chronic lesions, but the side of the root lesion could not be identified 
confidently by thermography alone. Moreover, thermographic abnormalities 
appeared not to follow a dermatomal distribution and failed to identify the 
clinical or electrophysiologic level of radiculopathy in most cases. Thus, the 
thermographic findings are nonspecific, of little diagnostic value, and of 
uncertain prognostic relevance.

Magnetic resonance study of disc degeneration in young low-back pain patients.

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, Central Hospital of Mikkeli, Finland.

The correlation of roentgenographic findings, clinical history, and incipient 
disc degeneration (DD), diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging, was analyzed 
in young patients with low-back pain (LBP). One or more lumbar discs were 
abnormal in 57% of the 20-year-old LBP patients (n = 75) and in 35% of the 
asymptomatic controls (n = 34) in MRI. Narrowed disc spaces and alterations 
attributed to lumbar Scheuermann's disease, shown on the radiographs, were 
always associated with DD in MRI. Such a strong relationship was not observed 
with transitional vertebrae, spondylolisthesis, spina bifida, or postural 
abnormalities. However, an increased weight, a positive straight leg raising 
test, and a reduced lumbar mobility was consistent with an increase in frequency 
of DD. Magnetic resonance imaging is a safe and sensitive method for studying 
the presence and etiologic factors of DD.

A 70-year-old male was admitted with left lumbago. He underwent a radical 
cystectomy five years earlier due to recurrent bladder carcinoma. Excretory 
urography revealed left hydronephrosis, left hydroureter and a right ureteral 
stone. Antegrade pyelography and urinary cytology of left kidney suggested the 
presence of left ureteral tumor and this was confirmed by an endoscopic work up 
through the nephrostomy. This patient was revealed to have a duplicated inferior 
vena cava by CT scan and vena cavography. A radical left nephroureterectomy was 
done uneventfully. M-VAC was adopted for post operative therapy.

Late neurological complications of Harrington-rod instrumentation.

Hales DD(1), Dawson EG, Delamarter R.

Author information:
(1)Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, Los Angeles School 
of Medicine 90024-1749.

From our patients who had idiopathic scoliosis, we identified a subset of 
eighteen in whom Harrington rods were used for fixation down to the fifth lumbar 
vertebra. In five of these patients, low-back pain, sciatica, and other 
neurological problems developed at two to thirty-two months after arthrodesis. 
These complications were caused by migration of the caudad hook into the spinal 
canal. The migration was probably caused by a combination of lumbosacral 
lordosis and mobility of the fifth lumbar vertebra (the most caudad mobile 
segment) on the segment below, resulting in weakening of the lamina of the fifth 
lumbar vertebra. After removal of the hardware, all patients had improvement of 
the lumbosacral and radicular pain as well as resolution of the neurological 
abnormalities.

Anomalous lumbosacral articulations and low-back pain. Evaluation and treatment.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopedics, University Hospital in Lund, Sweden.

Eleven patients ranging from 13 to 76 years in age with low-back pain and 
asymmetric sacro-transverse joints were studied. Preoperatively, scintimetry was 
performed in eight of the patients, in all cases with normal results. Ten of the 
11 patients had their sacrotransverse joint anesthesized in fluoroscopy. Nine of 
these experienced pain reduction or alleviation. Resection of the transverse 
process was performed in all cases. At follow-up, at 6 to 42 months 
postoperatively, seven patients reported total alleviation of pain, and two, 
significant improvement. Two patients had unchanged symptoms; one patient was 76 
years of age, had associated degenerative changes of the spine, and had no 
effect of local anesthetics in his joint, and the other was a 13-year-old male 
competitive swimmer. The authors conclude that, in patients with anomalous 
unilateral lumbosacral articulations and low-back pain, in whom local anesthesia 
into the joint gives pain alleviation, resection of the transverse process may 
be a worthwhile procedure.

Low-frequency magnetic field technology: quantifying spinal range of motion.

Cohn ML(1), Machado AF, Cohn SJ.

Author information:

Reliability of a sensitive, noninvasive technique for quantifying spinal range 
of motion was assessed by investigators who measured lumbar mobility of 19 
subjects with no history of low-back pain or spinal abnormalities. The 
measurement method used low-frequency, quasistatic magnetic dipole field and 
sensors which disturb this field in a precisely quantifiable manner. Sensors, 
affixed to the skin over T12 to L1 interspace and over the sacrum at the level 
of S1, were directly interfaced with an IBM PC-AT microcomputer, which was used 
for error-free collection and storage of data. Measurement results compared 
favorably to those obtained from the biplanar radiographic technique. 
Statistical analysis showed an extremely high degree of intraobserver and 
interobserver reliability. Additional advantages included simplicity and 
noninvasiveness. Overall, the magnetic field technique proved a significant 
advancement in clinically quantifying spinal mobility, allowing precise 
determination of impairment under American Medical Association guidelines.

Stiff-man syndrome updated.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, 
MN 55905.

Stiff-man syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by intermittent spasms and 
stiffness of the axial muscles, is associated with an electromyographic pattern 
of continuous motor unit activity in affected muscles. Since the initial 
description in 1956, the stiff-man syndrome has been reported to occur in 
various clinical and neurologic settings. In this study, we reviewed the current 
state of knowledge about this syndrome, defined diagnostic criteria, provided a 
long-term follow-up of the disorder, and assessed rehabilitative attempts in 
affected patients. Use of rigorous criteria that identify patients who have the 
stiff-man syndrome is important because the initial clinical manifestations are 
similar to those of other neuromuscular diseases. Analysis of 13 patients with 
stiff-man syndrome examined at the Mayo Clinic during the past 30 years revealed 
that treatment with diazepam decreased the muscle spasms. Because some muscle 
spasms usually persist, rehabilitation is an important adjunct that may further 
improve function when it is centered on the treatment of low-back pain and 
hyperlordosis, mobility problems, gait abnormalities, and muscular stiffness.

A case of persistent Müllerian duct syndrome associated with seminoma is 
presented. A 28-year-old man was hospitalized with the complaint of a palpable 
mass in the left lower abdomen and lumbago. Physical examination revealed a 
normal right scrotal testicle and a small right inguinal hernia that did not 
contain a mass, but no testicle was found in the left scrotum. Laparotomy was 
performed for suspected tumor of an intraabdominal testis. At abdominal 
exploration the left testis was found to be cross-ectopic to just behind the 
pubic symphysis and to be replaced completely with a large tumor, which was 
supplied by the left spermatic vessels and had a vas deferens emptied to the 
right seminal vesicle. In addition another cord-like structure was traced into 
the right inguinal canal. The tumor was dissected with these structures. On 
histological examination the tumor was pure seminoma and the cord-like structure 
proved to be an immature uterus, Fallopian tubes and seminal vesicle.

[Malignant lymphoma of the spinal epidural space. Report of three cases].

[Article in Japanese]

Iizuka H, Nakamura T, Kato M.

Three patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the spinal epidural space 
are reported. All three patients, a 3-year-old boy (Case 1), a 63-year-old 
female (Case 2), and a 64-year-old male (Case 3), manifested signs and symptoms 
of neurological involvement before the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was 
established by tissue examination. The tumors were located in the thoracic (Case 
3) and thoracolumbar regions (Cases 1 and 2). The initial signs and symptoms of 
all cases were low back pain and progressing myelopathies. Bony abnormalities of 
the vertebrae, seen on both plain X-rays and computed tomographic scans, were 
unremarkable except for bilateral L1 pedicle erosion observed in Case 2. Total 
or subtotal tumor removal was followed by radiation therapy with or without 
chemotherapy in all cases. The primary lesion in Case 1 was a paravertebral 
lymphoma that had invaded the adjacent thoracolumbar epidural space through the 
intervertebral foramina. In Case 2, the primary lesion, documented by 
post-mortem examination, was a submucosal lymphoma of the stomach. In Case 3, 
the site of primary lesion could not be determined, although splenic and 
retroperitoneal nodal involvement was found at autopsy. The authors take a 
skeptical view of the existence of "primary" spinal epidural lymphoma, which has 
been reported a few times. Each of the three patients reported here presented 
with an epidural mass as the initial clinical manifestation of malignant 
lymphoma.

MR imaging of the pars interarticularis.

Johnson DW(1), Farnum GN, Latchaw RE, Erba SM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, Univesity Health Center of Pittsburgh, PA 15213.

MR imaging of the lumbar spine has become a useful method for the noninvasive 
evaluation of low back pain. However, bone abnormalities are more difficult to 
detect than soft-tissue lesions, such as herniated disk. We reviewed 14 MR 
images of the lumbar spine in adults with spondylolisthesis. These were 
correlated with CT scans and plain films in all cases. From the CT scans and 
plain films we found that seven patients had spondylolysis and that seven had 
other causes for their spondylolisthesis. It was our opinion that the MR images 
suggested an abnormality of the pars interarticularis in all seven of the cases 
confirmed to have spondylolysis and in six of the seven patients that did not 
have spondylolysis. We also studied four cadaver lumbar spine, obtained as 
blocks of tissue, and scanned in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes with MR 
and in the sagittal and axial planes with CT. The tissue blocks were then 
sectioned in the sagittal plane. Spondylolysis is suggested on sagittal MR 
images when there is an inability to resolve the marrow signal in the pars as 
uninterrupted from the superior to the inferior facet. This is caused by a dark 
signal on all pulsing sequences in the pars resulting from marginal sclerosis at 
the site of the break. If there is also a gap at the site of the break then 
there will also be an increased signal in the gap resulting from the presence of 
soft tissue. We found four situations in which the pars can simulate 
spondylolysis on sagittal MR images: (1) sclerosis of the neck of the pars: (2) 
partial volume imaging of the degenerative spur of the superior facet slightly 
lateral to the pars; (3) partial facetectomy; and (4) osteoblastic metastatic 
replacement of the marrow of the pars.

Radiologic investigation of low back pain.

Pelz DM(1), Haddad RG.

Author information:
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University Hospital, London, Ont.

Low back pain is one of the commonest disorders, yet is the most confusing. The 
cost in work-time lost and in the search for and treatment of its many causes 
amounts to billions of dollars annually. The traditional techniques for anatomic 
visualization have been plain-film radiography and myelography, but they have 
limitations. The development of computed tomography and magnetic resonance 
imaging have substantially improved anatomic imaging. However, invasive 
procedures, such as discography, percutaneous nerve-root blocking and 
percutaneous facet injection, may be helpful in patients with disabling pain in 
whom noninvasive methods give negative findings, show abnormalities that do not 
correlate with the symptoms or identify multiple sites of disease. The invasive 
procedures are believed by some to be associated with too many complications. We 
have attempted to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of the currently 
available methods of investigating low back pain and the indications for their 
use.

Pennsylvania 15212-9986.

An automated technique for percutaneous lumbar discectomy applies the principle 
of suction cutting. The indications are leg pain greater than back pain 
(sciatica) and failure of all conservative therapy. The typical neurological and 
roentgenographic abnormalities of a contained herniated lumbar disc are 
mandatory. The procedure is performed with a Nucleotome (Surgical Dynamics, San 
Leandro, California) that is a specially designed, 2-mm blunt-tipped 
suction-cutting device inserted via a posterolateral approach into the affected 
disc using fluoroscopic control. The results that can be expected with the 
technique are similar to chymopapain and are in the 70% success range. Automated 
percutaneous discectomy has a demonstrably low morbidity and can be performed 
under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis.

Intradural disk herniation is a rare condition. Most of reported cases involve 
the lumbar spine and have histories of chronic low back pain followed by an 
acute episode of radicular pain with neurologic deficit. The authors report the 
myelographic and lopamidol-CT findings in a case of a L4-5 intradural disk 
herniation. These two examinations demonstrated an intradural multilobular mass 
associated with an extradural component at the level of the disk space and with 
a same density as it. Anatomic adherences between dura-mater and posterior 
longitudinal ligament could explain the primary mechanism of these intradural 
disk herniations; but operative or traumatic antecedents are often noted. Most 
often operation discloses only the intradural component with a small anterior 
dural cleft, without extradural abnormalities. Postoperative follow up is 
usually good.

Neuromuscular thermography of the lumbar spine with CT correlation.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiology, University of California San Francisco.

Fifteen asymptomatic volunteers and 19 patients with current CT (GE 8800 CT/T) 
scans demonstrating either thecal sac contour distortion or nerve root 
displacement from disc rupture or spinal stenosis of the L4-L5 or L5-S1 levels 
judged to be at least moderate in severity underwent lumbar thermography. All 
patients were studied with an infrared telethermographic unit (AGA model 720M) 
employing the technical standards recommended by the Academy of Neuromuscular 
Thermography. The thermographic exams were interpreted independently and in a 
blind fashion by two radiologists. Of the 15 exams of asymptomatic patients, six 
were interpreted as positive and consistent with nerve fiber irritation. Of the 
19 exams of patients with demonstrated CT abnormalities, all had positive 
thermograms for nerve fiber irritation (specificity 60%, sensitivity 100%). It 
is concluded that lumbar thermography is a sensitive examination for detecting 
those patients who will demonstrate lumbar spinal CT abnormalities and should 
play an important role in the diagnostic screening of low-back pain syndrome 
patients.

(1)Department of Physiology and Radiology, University of Kuopio.

The lumbar spines of 39 active young cross-country skiers suffering from long 
lasting or frequently remitting low back pain (LBP) were examined by a new 
radiological method. Plain radiographs in lateral and anteroposterior views were 
taken. The spinal curves, anomalies, and possible degenerative changes were 
investigated. The radiological method chosen proved to be suitable for imaging 
the lumbar spine. There were various radiologically detectable abnormalities in 
the spine. The most common findings were functional scoliosis (in 49%) and 
different spinal anomalies (in 23%). The mean lumbar lordosis was 69 degrees (70 
degrees in males and 64 degrees in females). The effect of abnormal lumbar 
posture on LBP should be further studied. None of the numerous radiological 
findings had an effect on therapy in these skiers.

[Course of conservatively treatment herniation of the lumbar disc. Radicular 
deficits and computed tomography findings.].

[Article in German]

i.Br..

In Western industrial countries, low back pain is one of the most frequent 
causes of illness. Between the 4th and 5th decades of life approximately 80% of 
adults complain of low back pain, lasting for fairly long periods. About 10% of 
this population must undergo disc surgery once during life. Several authors have 
discribed good results for lumbar disc surgery in 55%-86% of their cases. Few 
control data are available, however, on patients with radiologically proven 
herniation of the disc regression, who were treated conservatively. Their 
observations indicate that regression of herniation of a lumbar disc is possible 
using conservative therapy exclusively. A study was therefore carried out on 43 
patients with lumbar disc abnormalities, as demonstrated by spinal computed 
tomography (CT). Initially, 38 of them showed a herniation and 5 protrusion of 
the disc plus further neurological deficits and radicular pain syndromes. The 
subjects were followed up for over 20 months (mean) and monitored by CT in order 
to check the possibility that the CT findings, neurological deficits, and pain 
would regress a lengthy period of therapy. The results were the following: 
Initially, all patients complained of severe low back pain and sciatica, leading 
to subsequent treatment. At the time of follow-up, 15 of them still reported 
remittent or chronic low back pain, 9 remittent, and 16 chronic sciatic pain but 
of much less intensity. Before treatment, 40 patients had neurological deficits, 
whereas at the time of follow-up, only 24 patients still had deficits. In 2 
patients the symptoms had not changed and in 2 others slight deterioration was 
observed. CT control examinations showed clear regression in the extent of disc 
herniation in 15 patients, in 18 a moderate decrease, and in 9 cases the CT 
findings had not changed. A favorable tendency towards regression was observed 
in disc herniations at the level of L5-S1 and in cases showing sequestration of 
the disc. Herniations of the disc at higher levels between L4-5 and L3-4 or a 
lateral herniation, reaching the intervertebral foramen, showed on unfavorable 
prognosis.

Computed tomography, electrodiagnostic and clinical findings in chronic workers' 
compensation patients with back and leg pain.

Haldeman S(1), Shouka M, Robboy S.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, University of California, Irvine.

One hundred patients with complaints of low-back pain and leg pain, consistent 
with a diagnosis of sciatica, were evaluated. All patients had complaints for 
longer than 6 months and had recently undergone electrodiagnostic testing and 
computed tomography (CT). Correlation was made between symptoms, straight leg 
raising, clinical neurological deficits, electrodiagnostic and CT findings. The 
radiation of pain above or below the knee and pain on straight leg raising did 
not show a high correlation with each other or with neurological deficits or CT 
findings. Electrodiagnostic studies often defined a radiculopathy in patients 
with equivocal clinical signs. CT findings did not predict the nature of 
symptoms or clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Electrodiagnostic 
abnormalities showed the greatest ability to predict CT abnormalities. It is 
concluded that in chronic sciatica patients, no single diagnostic parameter is 
conclusive and a combination of clinical and laboratory findings is necessary to 
reach a diagnosis. In addition, many assumptions, valid in patients with acute 
pain cannot be extrapolated to patients with chronic sciatica.

Low back pain in the elderly: practical management concerns.

Swezey RL(1).

Erratum in
    Geriatrics 1988 Apr;43(4):102.

Low back pain occurs in 90% of the adult population. Previous episodes of low 
back pain in young adults predisposes to exacerbations and chronic problems in 
the elderly. Radiographic abnormalities demonstrating osteoarthrosis of the 
lumbar spine and facet joints and varying degrees of disk bulge and disk 
degeneration are the rule in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. 
Therefore, clinical assessments rather than purely morphological assessments are 
necessary to assess treatment plans and prognosis in elderly low back pain 
patients. Osteoarthritic changes are more often asymptomatic than symptomatic. 
CT and MRI demonstrations of spinal stenosis should be correlated with clinical 
findings to determine appropriate management decisions. Most elderly patients 
with low back pain with or without sciatica and with only radiographic CT or MRI 
rather than clinical evidence of spinal stenosis can be successfully managed 
conservatively.

The clinical pattern of 400 cases of brucellosis in Kuwait is presented. The 
disease was acute in 77 per cent, sub-acute in 12.5 per cent and chronic in 10.5 
per cent of cases. Raw milk was the major source of infection. The major 
features on presentation, irrespective of the course of the disease, were fever, 
sweating, headache, rigors, arthralgia, myalgia, and low back pain. 
Hepatosplenomegaly was present in 41 per cent of cases and in 32 per cent 
neither liver nor spleen were palpable. The haematologic findings were not 
specific and hepatic dysfunction (shown by liver enzyme abnormalities) was 
common. Skeletal (26 per cent) and genital (8.5 per cent) changes and 
neurobrucellosis (7 per cent) were the major complications. The ELISA was the 
most sensitive and reliable diagnostic test especially in relation to chronic 
brucellosis and neurobrucellosis. ELISA allowed the determination of 
brucella-specific immunoglobulins (Ig)G, IgM and IgA in the CSF, and provided 
profiles of Ig, in sera, which were different in patients with chronic (elevated 
IgG and IgA) from those with acute (elevated IgM alone or IgG, IgM and IgA) 
brucellosis. Treatment with tetracycline, doxycycline or rifampicin gave a cure 
rate of over 91 per cent in acute and subacute brucellosis. Co-trimoxazole was 
associated with a relapse rate of 50 per cent. Two drug combinations of 
streptomycin and tetracycline, streptomycin and rifampicin or streptomycin and 
doxycycline were effective, but one of five patients with chronic brucellosis 
relapsed. A combination of streptomycin, tetracycline and rifampicin with or 
without steroids was used successfully in neurobrucellosis, septicaemic shock 
and subacute bacterial endocarditis.

A cross-sectional study was carried out in 1985 among 5941 hospital workers from 
the Regional and University Hospital Center (CHRU) of Strasbourg on the occasion 
of the occupational medical examinations. The purpose was to determine the 
importance of low back pain among hospital staff and to describe the 
relationship between individual and occupational characteristics and the onset 
of these symptoms. Our results confirm the risk-factors determined by other 
investigators: age, sex, length of service, heavy work assignments (nursing 
aides, stretcherbearers, nurses, etc.) but also underline the role of obesity 
and previous attacks of low back pain, and invalidate the part musculoskeletal 
abnormalities play in this pathology.

Invasive procedures for treating herniated discs: clinical and cost 
considerations.

Camp PE(1).

Low back injury is the most frequent cause of occupational time loss and 
disability. A small percentage of back injuries represent surgical disease, and 
great care must be taken in applying surgical therapy to this complex problem. 
Perhaps the most important factor in surgical management of low back injury is 
accurate clinical and neurodiagnostic assessment. Because of the high cost of 
poor surgical outcomes, diagnostic tests and surgical procedures should be 
chosen on the basis of efficacy rather than cost per individual case. This is 
because the cost of an unsatisfactory result quickly eliminates any savings 
accumulated by performing a less precise or less effective procedure. The best 
surgical outcomes appear to result from a process consisting of (1) thorough 
clinical evaluation, (2) electrophysiological studies in selected cases, (3) CT 
scanning with multiplanar reformatting and three-dimensional images as needed, 
and (4) individually designed surgical procedures. When used as described 
elsewhere, this sequence appears to best define the association between clinical 
and radiographic abnormalities, provide the best percentage of successful 
results, and potentially offer the greatest long-term economies.

Computed tomographic myelography in the investigation of childhood scoliosis and 
spinal dysraphism.

(1)Department of Radiology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.

The combined investigations of positive contrast myelography and computed 
tomographic (CT) myelography were performed on 53 consecutive children. 
Thirty-eight (72%) of these investigations were performed as a routine 
pre-operative procedure to identify occult spinal dysraphism in patients with 
childhood scoliosis; the remainder were because of the "orthopaedic syndrome", 
cervical radiculopathy, back pain and patients with clinical findings to suggest 
spinal dysraphism. In the 20 patients (38%) with idiopathic scoliosis, there was 
no case of spinal dysraphism and CT myelography provided no additional 
information to the myelogram. In the seven patients with spinal dysraphism the 
plain radiographic abnormalities identified were lumbar vertebral abnormalities 
(five), thoracic vertebral abnormalities (one), and sacral agenesis (one). 
Diastematomyelia was found in four patients, a low tethered cord and lipoma in 
two patients and a large lipoma in one patient. In all of these cases the 
myelogram indicated the intraspinal abnormalities; however, CT myelography 
provided more precise anatomical detail. We conclude that CT myelography is not 
indicated in the initial preoperative assessment of idiopathic scoliosis but 
should be reserved for patients with congenital or complicated scoliosis where 
the association with dysraphism is well recognised.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spinous processes and adjacent soft 
tissues: normal and pathologic appearances.

The spinous processes and intervening soft tissues of the lumbar region may be 
involved by degenerative, inflammatory, neoplastic, and traumatic processes 
resulting in low back pain. While conventional radiography and computed 
tomography have proven useful in the demonstration of abnormalities affecting 
the spinous processes, they are of limited utility in the evaluation of the 
intervening soft tissues, which are the predominant site of initial pathologic 
involvement. To explore the potential role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
in the assessment of the spinous processes and adjacent ligaments, a 
retrospective review of 55 consecutive examinations of the lumbar spine was 
performed. The normal and pathologic appearances of the region on both T1 and T2 
weighted images were characterized, and the optimal imaging variables for 
demonstration of the spinous processes and adjacent soft tissues were determined 
with subsequent prospective application to new cases. Correlative examination of 
cadaveric sections and dried specimens was also performed to facilitate 
understanding of anatomical relationships visualized by MRI. Based upon the 
results of this investigation, MRI is the procedure of choice in the evaluation 
of disease processes affecting the spinous processes and intervening ligaments, 
primarily owing to the ability to image directly in the sagittal plane and its 
superior soft tissue contrast discrimination capability.

A fifty-three-year-old woman was admitted for gross hematuria and left lumbago. 
She was diagnosed as having left renal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) by renal 
angiography, but contrast enhanced CT of her left kidney demonstrated a low 
density area of renal parenchyma adjacent to AVM. Because a renal tumor could 
not be denied completely, we performed translumbar nephrectomy. No renal tumor 
was found in the removed kidney, and she was diagnosed as having cirsoid type 
AVM of the left kidney. The low density area in contrast enhanced CT was 
suspected to be indicating the ischemic renal parenchyma due to the steal 
phenomenon of renal AVM. This is the first report of a renal AVM with ischemic 
renal parenchyma demonstrated by CT.

Medical, psychological, and social factors associated with back abnormalities 
and self reported back pain: a cross sectional study of male employees in a 
Swedish pulp and paper industry.

Astrand NE.

A medical, psychological, and sociological study of 391 male employees in a 
Swedish pulp and paper industry was performed in 1961. Factors associated with 
back pain and back abnormality were investigated. Univariate analyses showed 
associations of back pain with occupational status, low education, duration of 
employment, low performance on cognitive tests, and neuroticism. Back 
abnormalities evaluated on the basis of physical examination showed in principle 
the same associations but the strength as well as the significances were 
stronger. Multiple logistic regression analyses using data for manual workers 
showed that neuroticism and duration of employment were directly associated with 
back pain. The same two variables and low performance on one of the 
psychological tests were directly associated with back abnormalities. Age showed 
no direct association with back pain or back abnormalities. Strong associations 
between back pain and back abnormalities with both perceived health and general 
working capacity and the doctor's evaluation in the same areas were 
demonstrated.

Musculoskeletal status and disability of MMPI profile subgroups among patients 
with low back pain.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology, University of Vermont, Burlington 05405.

The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles of 205 male and 
157 female patients with acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) were studied for 
replicable homogeneous subgroups using three cluster-analysis procedures. Two 
normal and three clinically elevated profile subgroups were identified. The two 
normal subgroups were characterized by relatively normal musculoskeletal 
condition and were least disabled, but they differed somewhat from each other in 
duration of pain, presence of physical abnormalities, and daily functioning. The 
third subgroup had the following characteristics: an elevated neurotic triad, 
greatest duration of symptoms, most abnormal physical findings, greatest 
limitation of motion, most pain complaints during physical examination, and the 
fewest number of intact functional activities. The fourth subgroup, with an 
elevated neurotic triad plus subclinical elevations on other scales, had 
somewhat less musculoskeletal impairment but had extensive work disability, 
financial compensation, and previous surgeries. The fifth and most pathologic 
profile subgroup surprisingly consisted largely of acute-pain patients whose 
musculoskeletal condition and daily functioning were similar to those of the 
normal subgroups. Patients in the three abnormal MMPI subgroups were exposed to 
more LBP physical-risk factors in the workplace. Implications for psychological 
treatment with these different profile types are discussed.

Epidural application of cortico-steroids in low-back pain and sciatica.

Andersen KH(1), Mosdal C.

Author information:
(1)University Clinic of Neurosurgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Seven women and nine men, aged 27-59 years (mean 45), with lumbar pain and 
sciatica had epidural blocks once with 80 mg of depo-medrol and lidocaine in 
individual doses. All had static and kinetic lumbar pain up to 16 years and all 
but four also pain radiating to the lower limbs. Radiculography was "negative" 
in all patients, but three exhibited minor neurological abnormalities. Five 
patients had had a lumbar hemilaminectomy previously. In case of segmental pain 
in the lower limbs the appropriate level was used, in all other patients 
injection was done in L3-4 interspace. By means of a visual analogous scale 10 
patients (62%) stated relief of half the pain the following day. One month later 
only 7 patients (43%) stated relief of one third of the pain. Only one patient 
benefited ultimately (after 6 months). In the remainder complaints were 
unaffected by the epidural injection. These discouraging results are not 
compatible with other reports, and a planned double-blind randomized 
investigation was abandoned. For the present category of patients (long-lasting 
complaints, previous "disc" operations) we found the epidural steroid injection 
useless.

A comparative analysis of the interpretations of lumbar spinal radiographs by 
chiropractors and medical doctors.

Frymoyer JW, Phillips RB, Newberg AH, MacPherson BV.

Ninety-nine anteroposterior and lateral lumbar radiographs taken of men, 18 to 
55 years of age, were randomly selected from participants in a population survey 
of low-back pain. Thirty-one (31%) had never had low-back pain; 44 (44%) had or 
were having mild low-back pain; and 24 (24%) had or were having severe low-back 
pain. Three chiropractors assessed 56 radiographic variables, which included 
determinations of disc space height, vertebral malalignments and subluxations, 
spondylosis, postural disturbances, relationships among pelvis and spine and 
other congenital or acquired abnormalities. Interobserver reliability 
measurements showed that 6 of the 56 variables analyzed produced a high 
interobserver reliability. Sixteen additional variables showed a fair 
interobserver reliability. Comparison of the observations made by the 
chiropractors and a radiologist showed minimal agreement except for disc space 
height assessments at L3-4 and L4-5. Few of the radiographic variables 
discriminated between the current or prior history of low-back and leg 
complaints, although a few variables (most notably disc space narrowing) were 
statistically associated with back or leg complaints (P = .025). The conclusion 
was reached that spinal radiographs, whether analyzed by measurements, by a 
radiologist, or by chiropractors, have minimal value in determining the presence 
or absence of low-back complaints and, in particular, have no value in 
epidemiologic studies.

Evaluation of children and young adults with tethered spinal cord syndrome. 
Utility of spinal and scalp recorded somatosensory evoked potentials.

Roy MW, Gilmore R, Walsh JW.

The diagnosis of tethered spinal cord syndrome should be considered in young 
patients with progressive orthopedic deformities, lower extremity weakness, 
urinary and fecal incontinence, low back pain, or combinations of these 
symptoms. Myelographic, computed tomographic, and urodynamic studies are useful 
for establishing a diagnosis, but contribute little to the evaluation of lower 
extremity sensory function or to the assessment of electrophysiologic impairment 
of the spinal cord itself. To determine the diagnostic usefulness of the 
somatosensory evoked potential after posterior tibial nerve stimulation 
(posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potential) in tethered spinal cord 
syndrome, 22 consecutive patients with symptoms of tethered spinal cord syndrome 
(aged 18 months to 22 years) underwent recording of posterior tibial nerve 
somatosensory evoked potential; results were correlated with clinical, 
myelographic, and operative findings. In patients with clinical symptoms but no 
myelographically demonstrable lesions, posterior tibial nerve somatosensory 
evoked potentials were within normal limits, suggesting normal physiologic 
function. In patients with myelographically and operatively confirmed tethering 
dysraphic lesions, posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potential was 
predictive of the level and laterality of the lesion. Similarly, ranking the 
severity of neurological impairment and extent of dysraphism at operation, as 
well as the extent of abnormality of posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked 
potential, revealed a significant (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) correlation 
between clinical severity and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked 
potential abnormalities. Postoperatively, in 8 patients, posterior tibial nerve 
somatosensory evoked potential also reflected improved function in relation to 
the level and type of dysraphic lesion present. These findings indicate that 
posterior tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potential is a sensitive indicator 
of neurophysiologic status in patients with tethered spinal cord, and is useful 
for determining the level of the conus medullaris, degree of spinal cord 
displacement, and severity of neurological impairment associated with this 
congenital disturbance of neuraxis formation. Recording of posterior tibial 
nerve somatosensory evoked potential is noninvasive and offers a more sensitive 
diagnostic tool than the clinical testing of sensation for detection of the 
development of neurologic deficits in patients with tethered cord syndrome.

Epidural analgesic techniques in the management of cervical pain.

Rowlingson JC, Kirschenbaum LP.

The injection of depot steroids into the cervical epidural space can maximize 
the conservative management of patients with cervical radiculopathy. We 
retrospectively studied 25 patients with cervical radiculopathy who received a 
total of 45 epidural injections of steroids. Sixty-four percent of the patients 
had a good or excellent response to cervical epidural steroid injection, whereas 
other conservative treatment modalities had not helped them. The patient's 
history and a description of the pain and the corresponding neurological 
abnormalities present were of value in the selection of patients who were most 
likely to respond favorably to epidural steroids, whereas laboratory studies 
were not as useful. Anesthesiologists, many already familiar with the use of 
epidural steroid injection in the treatment of low back pain, should add to 
their armamentarium the use of such techniques in the management of patients 
with acute and chronic cervical radiculopathy.

Low back pain: a radiographic enigma.

Phillips RB, Frymoyer JW, Mac Pherson BV, Newburg AH.

Ninety-nine anteroposterior and lateral lumbar radiographs taken of males ages 
18-55 were independently analyzed by three chiropractors who assessed 56 
variables, including determinations of disc space height, vertebral 
malalignments and subluxations, spondylosis, postural disturbances, 
relationships between pelvis and spine, and other congenital or acquired 
abnormalities. The distribution of low back complaints in this study included 
31% with no low back pain, 44% with previous or present mild low back pain and 
24% with previous or current severe, and often disabling, low back pain. 
Determinations were made of interobserver reliability between the three 
chiropractors and a medical radiologist. Of the 56 radiographic variables 
assessed by the chiropractors, six demonstrated a high interobserver 
reliability. In general, the best reliability was for variables that were actual 
measurements, rather than subjective observations. Sixteen additional variables 
demonstrated a fair interobserver reliability. Comparison of the observations 
between a radiologist and the chiropractors showed correlations in their 
assessments of disc space height at L3-4 and L4-5; otherwise, there was poor 
interobserver reliability. Few of the radiographic variables were found to be 
reliable predictors of present or prior history of low back and leg complaints. 
A few variables (most notably disc space narrowing) were statistically 
associated with back or leg complaints (P = 0.025). We conclude that spinal 
radiographs, whether analyzed by measurements, by a radiologist or by 
chiropractors, have minimal value in predicting the presence or absence of low 
back complaints and, in particular, have no value in epidemiological studies.

On the usefulness of somatosensory evoked responses for the evaluation of lower 
back pain.

Perlik S, Fisher MA, Patel DV, Slack C.

Electrodiagnostic and concurrent computed tomographic (CT) scan data were 
reviewed from 30 patients with lower back pain and unilateral radicular 
symptoms. Electrodiagnostic examination included somatosensory evoked responses 
(SSEPs) of the L-4, L-5, and S-1 roots stimulating specific sensory nerves. In 
three patients with normal CT scans, electrophysiologic studies were 
unrevealing. In the remaining 27 patients, CT scans were consistent with root 
injury, as were 15 of 17 myelograms. In 21 of these 27 patients, SSEP 
abnormalities consistent with focal root dysfunction and the radiographic 
findings were present. Other electrodiagnostic abnormalities (ie, 
electromyographic F response or H reflex) were limited to the six patients with 
clinical signs. These data indicate that SSEPs are valuable for evaluating root 
injury in patients with lower back pain, particularly where focal sensorimotor 
or reflex signs are absent.

Renal cell carcinoma originating from dysplastic kidney.

Shirai M, Kitagawa T, Nakata H, Urano Y.

A case of renal cell carcinoma developing from a unilateral dysplastic kidney is 
presented. The patient was a 33-year-old woman who had lumbago one year and a 
half prior to death. Multiple abnormal uptakes of 67Ga were seen by 
scintigraphy. Bone marrow biopsy indicated adenocarcinoma but the primary site 
was unknown despite extensive examination. At autopsy the carcinoma was 
wide-spread but no obvious primary-appearing lesion was detected in all the 
organs except the left kidney. Incidentally the patient had unilateral (left) 
renal dysplasia. An elaborate study revealed the primary site of the carcinoma 
within the cystic structure of the dysplastic kidney. This tumor showed 
reactivity with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin associated antigen (DBA-Ag), 
soybean agglutinin (SBA), and peanut agglutinin (PNA) which have reactivity with 
renal tubules.

[Tethered spinal cord syndrome: report of 2 cases].

[Article in Portuguese]

Machado MA, Lemos S, De Morais JV.

The tethered spinal cord syndrome is a disease that is part of the group of 
spinal dysraphisms, that was recently recognized as an individualized 
nosological entity, yet not frequently diagnosed among us. It is characterized 
by shortening and thickening of the filum terminale which prevents the ascent of 
the spinal cord into spinal canal, the conus medularis abnormally remaining in a 
low place. It is associated in all cases with spina bifida. The diagnosis is 
simple, once the disease is suspected. It is manifested by progressive motor or 
sensory deficit in the legs, urinary incontinence, scoliosis and leg or back 
pain, specially in young children. The plain lumbosacral RX always shows spina 
bifida. Myelography makes the diagnostic. It shows, basically, the negative 
image of the thickened filum terminale and the low placed conus medularis. Other 
exams which can help are the computerized tomography and the ultra-sound of the 
spinal cord. The surgical treatment is very simple and heals without sequels if 
done in due time. It consists in a sectioning of the filum terminale through 
laminectomy. Two cases diagnosed and treated at Hospital da Baleia, from 
Fundação Benjamin Guimarãcs, Belo Horizonte, are reported in this paper.

Lumbar spine films in primary care: current use and effects of selective 
ordering criteria.

Deyo RA, Diehl AK.

Low back pain (LBP) often prompts radiography, although the diagnostic yield of 
lumbar spine films is low, and many radiographic abnormalities are unrelated to 
symptoms. Criteria have been proposed for selective x-ray use, but their value 
and safety are uncertain. To evaluate these criteria, the authors prospectively 
studied 621 walk-in patients with LBP. The yield of explanatory x-ray findings 
was over three times greater among patients with indications for radiography 
than among those without. Furthermore, an indication for x-rays existed for all 
patients found to have a malignancy, and for 13 of 14 patients with an 
identified fracture. Actual physician ordering, however, did not correspond well 
with the recommended indications. Application of selective criteria appears safe 
and may improve the yield of useful findings. It may not, however, reduce x-ray 
utilization from current levels without further refinement in the criteria.

Congenital absence of lumbar facets as a cause of lower-back pain.

Segal D, Franchi AV.

Unilateral arch hypertrophy secondary to congenital absence of lumbar articular 
facets is a rare condition of still undetermined etiology. Most symptomatic 
cases had a history of mild trauma. Radiologic criteria using plain films and 
CAT scan are available to make the diagnosis of unilateral arch hypertrophy and 
the specific defects that cause this condition. Awareness of these signs by the 
orthopedic community may prove helpful in recognizing this anomaly as a cause of 
lower-back pain in the future. It would seem logical to conclude that the source 
of pain in patients with this congenital anomalies may be due to microfracture 
of the hypertrophic side caused by the concentration of stresses. Treatment of 
this condition varies, and too few cases are reported to draw any conclusions. A 
conservative approach of bedrest and immobilization should be attempted first. 
However, if this regime proves unsuccessful after a long well-documented trial, 
fusion seems to offer a good prognosis in the cases thus far treated by this 
method.

Nakada H, Ogawa M, Shirai M, Kitagawa T.

A case of renal cell carcinoma developing from a unilateral dysplastic kidney is 
reported. A 33-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of lumbago 
due to metastatic cancer to the bones. She was treated with interferon and 
combination chemotherapies, but died nine and a half months after initiation of 
the therapy. Autopsy revealed a widely metastasized renal cell carcinoma 
originating from a dysplastic left kidney. This is the second such case in the 
literature. Clinical management of renal dysplasia should take into 
consideration the possibility of developing malignancy.

Stress injuries of the pars interarticularis: radiologic classification and 
indications for scintigraphy.

Pennell RG, Maurer AH, Bonakdarpour A.

Lumbar radiographs and scintigrams were compared in 24 patients with low back 
pain. Radiographs of the pars interarticularis were classified as type 0, 
normal; type 1, a stress fracture with an irregular lucent line in an area of 
sclerosis; type 2, an evolving or healed stress injury showing either sclerosis 
or narrowing; or type 3, a nonunited fracture with a large lucent defect and 
well defined margins. Radiographs and scintigrams were abnormal in 88% (21/24) 
and 54% (13/24) of patients, respectively. Scintigraphy was most often positive 
with type 1 (73% [11/15]) and negative with type 3 abnormalities (83% [10/12]). 
Findings suggest that in the proper clinical setting, identification of a type 1 
abnormality is sufficient to diagnose acute pars injury. If a type 2 or 3 
abnormality is present, scintigraphy is used to confirm recent injury. Finally, 
if no radiographic abnormality is present at the site of localized pain, 
scintigraphy should be used to exclude stress injury not radiographically 
apparent.

The relationship between anthropometric, postural, muscular, and mobility 
characteristics of males ages 18-55.

Pope MH, Bevins T, Wilder DG, Frymoyer JW.

Three hundred twenty-one males, ages 18-55, had standardized tests to determine 
height, weight, Davenport Index, leg length inequality, determination of flexion 
and extension torques, flexion/extension balance, range of motion, straight leg 
raising, and lumbar lordosis. A total of 106 (33.0%) had never experienced 
low-back symptoms; 144 (44.9%) had or were having moderate low-back pain (LBP); 
and 71 (22.1%) had or were having severe low-back symptoms. These three 
subgroups showed no significant differences in height, weight, Davenport Index, 
lumbar lordosis, or leg length inequalities. LBP patients had less flexor and 
extensor strength and were flexor overpowered, had diminished range of motion 
for spinal extension and axial rotation (P = 0.003, P = 0.0005), and diminished 
straight leg raising capacity (P = 0.04). A multivariate correlation matrix 
demonstrated no typical pattern of associated abnormalities except a diminished 
spinal range of motion in one plane was associated with the anticipated 
diminishment in all other planes of motion, and often with greater restrictions 
of straight leg raising tests.

CT in low back pain syndrome.

Chafetz NI, Mani JR, Genant HK, Morris JM, Hoaglund FT.

CT has become the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing the specific cause 
of low back pain syndrome. This article describes and illustrates those 
abnormalities commonly associated with low back pain: disk herniation, spinal 
stenoses, facet joint abnormalities, spondylosis, inflammatory conditions of the 
lumbar spine, and sacroiliitis.

Recognition of lumbar disc disease with magnetic resonance imaging.

Mikhael MA, Ciric IS, Kudrna JC, Hindo WA.

Ten normal adult volunteers, 75 patients with low back pain and/or lumbar 
radiculopathy, 16 patients following chymopapain treatment, 14 patients with 
recurrent symptoms following disc surgery, and two patients with distal cord 
compression were scanned on Fonar 3000 permanent magnet scanner. Of all the 
patients 98 had additional computed tomography scans (CT) of the lumbar spine 
and 82 had myelography. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scans 
were both diagnostic in cases of herniated and extruded discs. MRI scan showed 
more information concerning the degenerative state of the intervertebral discs. 
It was relatively more accurate in detecting, small bulging and herniated discs 
without ruptured anulus and the relation of the migrated fragments of extruded 
discs to both the back of the vertebrae and the thecal sac. Moreover, lumbar MRI 
matched the clinical response of disc disease to chymopapain treatment more than 
lumbar CT scan. In addition, the MRI studies differentiated more accurately 
postoperative epidural fibrotic changes from recurrent herniated and/or extruded 
disc and detected distal spinal cord abnormalities. CT scan easily detected 
laterally herniated lumbar discs. Myelography was the diagnostic study in cases 
of arachnoiditis.

Unsuspected sacral fractures: detection by radionuclide bone scanning.

Schneider R, Yacovone J, Ghelman B.

Unsuspected sacral fractures may present with confusing clinical, radiographic, 
and scintigraphic findings. Sacral fractures were diagnosed by radionuclide bone 
scans in 23 patients, most of whom were osteopenic and had only minor or no 
trauma. Symptoms usually consisted of low back pain, sometimes with 
radiculopathy, but some of the patients were asymptomatic and the fractures 
discovered coincidentally. Abnormalities on bone scanning consisted of increased 
uptake in the body of the sacrum and one or both sacral alae or only in a single 
sacral ala. A retrospective review showed abnormalities on radiographs in 11 of 
the 23 patients and in all four of the CT scans obtained, but the abnormalities 
were often overlooked or misinterpreted on the original reading. Bone biopsies 
of the sacrum, done in two patients to rule out metastatic disease, showed 
reactive bone formation consistent with fracture. Recognition of the 
characteristic scintigraphic patterns in sacral fractures and the frequency of 
these fractures in osteopenic patients can avoid mistaken diagnoses and 
unnecessary tests or treatment.

[Syndrome of redundant nerve roots of the cauda equina. Apropos of 2 cases].

[Article in French]

Ouaknine GE, Couillard P.

Redundant nerve roots of the cauda equina (RNR) are considered to be extremely 
rare. This finding was reported for the first time in 1953 by Verbiest and since 
then several articles have being published on this subject. In an extensive 
review of the literature we have found 60 cases of RNR, 54 cases of which were 
operated including two new cases that we report in the present article. The RNR 
consist of elongated, tortuous and serpiginous nerve roots of the cauda equina. 
This disorder mainly affects males and the clinical history ranges from few 
months to three decades. The illness often start by a low back pain or sciatica 
associated or not with weakness or parasthesia of the lower limbs. There is 
sometimes a medullar claudication with gait ant sphincters disturbances. The 
electromyogram shows signs of chronic denervation and there is a high protein 
level in the CSF exam. X-rays of the lumbosacral spine show spondylarthrosis 
generally associated with a narrow spinal canal. The diagnosis is made by a 
lumbar myelogram which shows a partial or complete block of the column contrast. 
Serpentine defects suggest an arteriovenous medullar malformation, but the 
aortic angiogram is normal. At the opening of the dura-mater there is a sudden 
extrusion of the roots which are under pressure. The elongated roots are 
generally knotten or curled. One or several roots are very long but their 
diameter and aspect are normal. The treatment includes a decompressive lumbar 
laminectomy associated with a decompressive duroplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

Spine problems in emergency department patients: does every patient need an 
x-ray?

Kaplan D.

Two hundred adults with spine problems were evaluated by one examiner in a 
community hospital emergency department. A patient was considered to have a 
spine problem requiring evaluation if presenting with pain in the neck or back 
not obviously caused by a process outside of the spine (eg, back pain in a 
patient with renal colic); if there was known or suspected trauma to the neck or 
back; or if the clinical setting suggested spinal tumor, infection, metabolic 
bone disease, or ankylosing spondylitis. Of the 200 patients, 143 were studied 
by x-ray films. Six patients (6 of 143, or 4%) had x-ray abnormalities that 
mandated specific treatment. Fifty-two of the 57 patients not receiving x-ray 
studies were followed up at 2 months. Thirty-three of these patients (63%) had 
no x-ray studies in the interim and had improved greatly. Nineteen (37%) had 
been studied radiographically in the interim, but no abnormality requiring 
specific treatment was found in any patient. Emergency physicians should be 
aware that x-ray studies of the spine have low utility for patients whose 
histories and examinations are benign, that especially for women lumbosacral 
x-ray studies involve high gonadal radiation exposure, and that selected 
patients can be managed without x-ray studies and still be satisfied recipients 
of adequate medical care.

Infant treatment decisions: ethics and cost.

Weber LJ.

Though society has been conditioned to believe that cost should not enter into 
medical care decisions, moral reasons do exist for considering cost in treatment 
decisions. Ethicists traditionally have distinguished between ordinary, or 
morally obligatory, means of preserving life and extraordinary, or morally 
optional, means. Treatment that offers a reasonable hope of benefit to the 
patient without excessive pain, expense, or other inconvenience would be 
considered ethically ordinary. Treatment that can not be obtained without 
excessive expense, which could greatly burden the patient's family and deprive 
them of other goods, could be legitimately withheld. The principle of 
proportionality, which requires balancing the probability and extent of 
potential harm against the probability and extent of good, also has been applied 
to medical care decisions. It has been used to focus attention on the cost of 
technologies and policies. Some have argued, however, that the individual 
patient--not a larger social good--should be the physician's only concern. 
Society should recognize that doing everything possible to save everyone who 
might survive leaves fewer resources to meet the needs of the poor and the 
disadvantaged. One way to limit the costs of intensive care, therefore, would be 
to limit the availability of neonatal treatment facilities. Infants would thus 
have to be selected for treatment according to prospects for survival or other 
medical indicators. Before society cuts back on infant care, however, it must 
address the question of justice. Since many low-birth weight babies are born to 
poor families, withholding infant treatment in some cases might increase, rather 
than reduce, the inequalities that already exist in health care 
delivery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

[Diagnosis and treatment of tethered spinal cord syndrome--based on experience 
of 77 cases].

[Article in Japanese]

Nakamura T.

Since 1976, the author has experienced 77 cases that have been diagnosed as the 
tethered spinal cord syndrome. These cases could be divided into two groups by 
the relative level of conus medullaris to that of L3 body, i.e. 34 cases in 
which the conus medullaris is tethered below the superior border of L3 body were 
classified into low placed conus medullaris (LPCM) and 43 in which the conus 
medullaris is located above the same level into the tight filum terminale (TFT). 
As to symptoms and signs, incontinence, gait disturbance, foot and toe 
deformities, lumbosacral tumor and sacral dimple were seen more often in the 
LPCM group. On the other hand, nocturia, pain in the back and in the lower 
limbs, positive Lasègue sign and tight back were seen more often in the TFT 
group. Neurological signs were seen more often in the LPCM group. In 3 cases of 
LPCM, and 10 of TFT, spina bifida was not visualized on the plain X-ray film of 
the spinal column. LPCM could be definitively diagnosed by myelography taken 
with the patient lying in the supine position, on the other hand myelography did 
not always give definitive diagnosis of TFT. Surgery for releasing the tethering 
conus was carried out in 58 of 77 cases. Of which 49 have been followed up more 
than 2 months after operation. Some degree of improvement of various symptomes 
and signs, was noted in 35 (68%) of these patients.

Elevated sacroiliac joint uptake ratios in systemic lupus erythematosus.

De Smet AA, Mahmood T, Robinson RG, Lindsley HB.

Sacroiliac joint radiographs and radionuclide sacroiliac joint uptake ratios 
were obtained on 14 patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus. Elevated 
joint ratios were found unilaterally in two patients and bilaterally in seven 
patients when their lupus was active. In patients whose disease became 
quiescent, the uptake ratios returned to normal. Two patients had persistently 
elevated ratios with continued clinical and laboratory evidence of active lupus. 
Mild sacroiliac joint sclerosis and erosions were detected on pelvic radiographs 
in these same two patients. There was no association between low back pain or 
HLA-B27 positivity and the radiographic or scintigraphic abnormalities. Elevated 
quantitative sacroiliac joint uptake ratios may occur as a manifestation of 
active systemic lupus erythematosus.

Low-back pain in industry. An old problem revisited.

Yu TS, Roht LH, Wise RA, Kilian DJ, Weir FW.

Low-back pain is a major occupational health problem. Risk factors predisposing 
to the development of low-back pain are discussed. These include individual risk 
factors such as age, sex, anthropometry, musculoskeletal abnormalities, muscle 
strength and physical fitness, psychological factors, and previous attacks of 
low-back pain and workplace factors such as heavy work, lifting, bending, and 
slipping. Various programs for prevention are evaluated. These include selection 
of workers, education and training regarding lifting methods, design of lifting 
jobs, and fitness training. Limitations of the various studies of these programs 
are discussed. Preemployment strength testing and ergonomic job design together 
appear to offer the greatest promise.

Psychological aspects of patients having multiple operations for low back pain.

Bouras N, Bartlett JR, Neil-Dwyer G, Bridges PK.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether psychological abnormalities 
were present in patients still complaining of low back pain after more than one 
operation. It was found that these patients were more psychiatrically disturbed 
and socially disabled than a matched control group whose back pain responded to 
one operation. These results suggest that patients requiring assessment for a 
possible second laminectomy should also be psychiatrically examined.

Pain in Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Ropper AH, Shahani BT.

The clinical features of pain were prospectively analyzed in 29 consecutive 
patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Sixteen (55%) had characteristic 
pain early in the illness described as similar to the muscular discomfort 
following exercise ("charley horse"). Pain preceded weakness by one to five days 
in four patients. The anterior and posterior aspects of the thighs, the 
buttocks, and the low part of the back were most frequently affected. Pain was 
frequently worse at night. Specific clinical signs or electrophysiologic 
abnormalities were not associated with pain, but serum creatine kinase level was 
elevated in ten of 13 patients with pain and only one of eight without pain. A 
review of previously reported pathologic material in five patients with GBS 
failed to disclose a relation between inflammation of dorsal root ganglia and 
pain. These results suggest that alterations in muscle related to neurogenic 
changes may cause the typical pain of GBS.

Electromyographic abnormalities in redundant nerve root syndrome of the cauda 
equina.

Reinstein L, Twardzik FG, Russo GL, Bose P.

This report documents the seventh patient with redundant nerve root syndrome of 
the cauda equina in which electromyographic abnormalities were reported. A 
79-year-old woman developed low back pain radiating into the left lower 
extremity. Electromyography (EMG) revealed partial denervation of the left 
medial gastrocnemius muscle. Metrizamide myelography disclosed a complete block 
of the spinal canal at the L3 vertebral level, and a coiled nerve root was 
present behind the L2 vertebral body. Computed tomography showed marked 
spondylotic narrowing of the spinal canal at the L3 to L4 vertebral level, and 
spinal stenosis at the L4 to L5 vertebral level. An L3 laminectomy revealed 
nodular bony overgrowth and ligamentous hypertrophy compressing the dura. 
Postoperatively, the patient experienced significant pain relief and increased 
ambulation ability. Electromyographic abnormalities in the left medial 
gastrocnemius muscle were still present at three- and six-month follow-up.

Inability to prove instability. A critical appraisal of clinical-radiological 
flexion-extension studies in lumbar disc degeneration.

Penning L, Wilmink JT, van Woerden HH.

In two groups of patients with low back pain radiological flexion-extension 
studies were made (one in the standing position, the other in the lateral 
decubitus position), and the degree of mobility and location of instantaneous 
centres of motion determined between L2 and the sacrum. The study failed to 
demonstrate distinctly abnormal patterns of motion ('instability'). The main 
reason is that such problems, as shown in the biomechanical laboratory, are not 
reproduced in the clinical setting. Smaller abnormalities will remain undetected 
because of measurement errors of the method, making differentiation between 
normal and abnormal motion virtually impossible.

Current concepts in evaluation of the lumbar facet joints.

Carrera GF, Williams AL.

The lumbar facet joints have been recognized for many years to be an important 
source of chronic low back pain with sciatic radiation. The presence of 
unilateral chronic low back pain with sciatic radiation, but without objective 
neurological abnormality, is typical of symptomatic lumbar facet arthropathy. 
Computed tomography is much better able to demonstrate significant lumbar facet 
joint abnormalities than conventional radiographic examination. Computed 
tomographic findings in the lumbar facet joints appear to correlate better with 
clinical relief following intraarticular lumbar facet block than do findings on 
conventional studies. The combination of computed tomography and 
fluoroscopically controlled intraarticular lumbar facet block is becoming an 
important examination sequence in the accurate diagnosis of symptomatic lumbar 
facet arthropathy. The development of concepts regarding lumbar facet joint 
abnormalities are reviewed, and implications of the development of new 
procedures for studying lumbar facet disease in the patient with chronic low 
back pain and sciatica are discussed.

The value of quantitative sacroiliac scintigraphy in detection of sacroiliitis.

Miron SD, Khan MA, Wiesen EJ, Kushner I, Bellon EM.

To evaluate clinical usefulness of quantitative sacroiliac scintigraphy (QSS) in 
detecting sacroiliitis, we used a modified, pixel by pixel technique for 
calculating sacroiliac joint/sacrum uptake ratios (sacroiliac joint index - 
SII). We studied 90 controls, 18 selected patients with active sacroiliitis, 2 
ankylosing spondylitis patients with completely ankylosed sacroiliac joints, 14 
patients with nonspecific low back pain and 5 patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis. In the controls, we found that the SII decreases with increasing age 
(P less than 0.001) and is higher in males than in females (P less than 0.005). 
In the patients with active sacroiliitis, 9 out of 14 older than 30 had an 
abnormal SII; 3 of these patients showed no radiographic or CT abnormalities of 
the sacroiliac joints. None of the 4 patients with sacroiliitis under 30 years 
of age had values which fell out of the normal range for their age and sex. Only 
1 of the 14 patients with non-inflammatory low back pain had an abnormally high 
SII. A borderline SII was found in 1 of the 5 patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis. QSS may be useful in detecting active sacroiliitis, sometimes even 
before the occurrence of radiologic abnormalities. However, because of its low 
sensitivity, its clinical usefulness is limited, especially in patients under 30 
years of age.

Sacral abnormalities in Marfan syndrome.

Fishman EK, Zinreich SJ, Kumar AJ, Rosenbaum AE, Siegelman SS.

Five women with Marfan syndrome had abnormalities of the sacrum disclosed by 
computed tomography. Each had evidence of expansion of the central sacral spinal 
canal and enlargement of sacral foramina associated with extensive bony erosion. 
Three patients complained of low back pain, two were asymptomatic. Sacral 
meningoceles were demonstrated in three cases (including two of the three with 
symptoms). A fourth patient had a thoracic meningocele. The sacral abnormalities 
are attributed to defective collagen resulting in expansion of weakened dura 
which leads to pressure erosion of contiguous osseous structures.

Long-term anatomic and functional changes in patients with adolescent idiopathic 
scoliosis treated by Harrington rod fusion.

Cochran T, Irstam L, Nachemson A.

One hundred patients from the Gothenburg Scoliosis Data Base were studied. They 
met the following criteria: (1) adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (2) completion 
of treatment before age 20, (3) a minimum follow-up of five years thereafter, 
(4) a minimum age of 22 years at final follow-up, and (5) operation performed by 
the senior author. Of these, 95 were personally examined. The surgical technique 
from 1968 to 1973 included a two-stage Harrington distraction, with fusion added 
at the second operation (52 patients). From 1973 to 1975, 48 patients were 
treated with a one-stage distraction and fusion after a week of preoperative 
Cotrel traction. Postoperatively, all patients were treated with a Milwaukee 
brace. A spinal examination and functional assessment, including a questionnaire 
and pain drawing, full standing anterior-posterior (AP), and lateral 
roentgenograms of the spine, was performed by independent observers. Eighty-five 
subjects without scoliosis served as a control group. The radiographic 
evaluation showed the usual nearly 50% permanent correction at the follow-up 
examination averaging nine years postoperatively. Lateral roentgenograms, 
however, demonstrated in 52% flattened or kyphotic cervical spines producing no 
significant complaints, non-significant flattening of the thoracic kyphosis, but 
significant lowering of the lumbar lordosis. Fifteen of the 24 patients with 
distal hook insertion and fusion including L4 or L5 demonstrated retrolisthesis. 
All had significant low-back pain. Degenerative facet joint changes and disc 
space narrowing was noted in 11 patients, again with a distal hook purchase in 
L4 or L5. Compared to the controls, the operated patients, as a group, revealed 
no lessened activity or back pain at any location.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Radionuclide skeletal scintigraphy is recognized as a screening method for 
patients with back pain. The analog scintigram is a functional image with high 
sensitivity and low specificity. The improvement in specificity can be achieved 
using computer procedures as digital imaging, smoothing, contrast enhancement 
and profile selection to quantitate certain properties of the scan. 
Three-phase-skeletal scintigraphy, 67-Ga-citrate or 111-In labeled leucocytes 
augment the specificity, too.

Arthritis in Behcet's syndrome.

Caporn N, Higgs ER, Dieppe PA, Watt I.

The clinical and radiological features of fourteen patients with Behcet's 
syndrome have been reviewed with particular reference to joint disease. Thirteen 
patients (93%) suffered recurrent peripheral oligo- or poly-arthritis, this 
symptom being the presenting complaint in two (14%). There were no radiographic 
abnormalities in peripheral joints. Ten patients (71%) complained of low back 
pain and in seven (50%) there was a mild erosive sacro-iliitis. Five patients 
(36%) had an enthesopathy (calcaneal spurs) one of whom also demonstrated 
vertebral body squaring. Patients with sacro-iliitis did not possess the HLA B27 
antigen. Behcet's syndrome should be entertained in the radiological 
differentiation of sacro-iliitis with a clinical arthropathy.

Stimulation of the peripheral nervous system for pain control.

Long DM.

Transcutaneous stimulation is a proven effective way to relieve pain. Its 
optimal use requires an accurate patient diagnosis. Treatment of pain as a 
symptom only is likely to fail. There must be a careful psychosocial evaluation, 
for the majority of patients who come to the doctor complaining of pain have 
major psychological, social, or behavioral factors that are most important in 
the genesis of the complaint. Drug abuse must be corrected. Related symptoms, 
such as anxiety and depression, must be treated. Then, a thorough trail of 
transcutaneous stimulation is mandatory. A desultory use will undoubtedly lead 
to failure. This trial must begin with patient education by experienced 
personnel. Then the electrodes must be properly applied, and there must be a 
regular follow-up of stimulation to be certain the patient is utilizing it 
correctly. The patient must be supported through an adequate trial which should 
extend over 2-4 weeks before purchase of the device is contemplated. 
Furthermore, all related nursing and physician personnel must be educated in the 
proper use of the technique. The uninformed professional who denigrates the 
therapy is a very effective deterrent to appropriate use. In this situation, 
transcutaneous electrical stimulation will be of great value in the treatment of 
acute musculoskeletal injury and acute postoperative pain. It will be effective 
in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury pain, chronic musculoskeletal 
abnormalities, chronic pain in the patient who has undergone multiple operations 
upon the low back and neck, visceral pain, some of the reflex sympathetic 
dystrophies, and postherpetic neuralgia. Stimulation will not help a complaint 
which is psychosomatic in origin. It will not influence drug addiction. It is 
not likely to be useful in any situation where secondary gain is important. The 
metabolic neuropathies, pain of spinal cord injury, and pain from 
cerebrovascular accident will not respond frequently enough to warrant more than 
hopeful trials. The technique is inexpensive, places the patient in control of 
his own pain, and has no known serious side effects. Its widespread application 
awaits the development of reasonable systems to provide this service to 
physicians and patients. Stimulation-induced analgesia deserves a place in the 
armamentarium of every physician dealing with the complaint of pain.

Low back pain: the controversy of radiologic evaluation.

Gehweiler JA Jr, Daffner RH.

A prospective study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of including oblique 
radiographs as part of a lumbar vertebral column examination. Five hundred 
patients in the second through ninth decades of life were evaluated. Of those, 
12% had an abnormality detected on the 45 degree oblique view that was not 
apparent on the frontal or lateral radiographs. Those abnormalities included 
degenerative changes of apophyseal joints (6%), spondylolysis (4%), osteoid 
osteoma, anomalous apophyseal joint, and abnormal pars interarticularis (2%). 
These results are compared with those of other investigators and the reasons for 
variance are discussed.

Effect of levomepromazine on EEG and on clinical side effects after lumbar 
myelography with metrizamide.

Standnes B, Oftedal SI, Weber H.

In patients with lumbago-sciatica levomepromazine is a potent supplement to 
analgetics in pain treatment. The hypothesis that neuroleptics increase the risk 
of epileptic seizures after metrizamide myelography was not confirmed in a 
series of 77 patients, 26 with and 51 without levomepromazine medication, before 
and after lumbar metrizamide myelography. No differences existed between the 
groups with regard to the appearance of EEG abnormalities such as slow waves or 
spikes. Mild side effects were more frequent in the levomepromazine group, 
except nausea and vomiting. Lumbar metrizamide epidurography in 30 patients did 
not cause any abnormal EEG.

1980 Volvo award in clinical sciences. Assessment of patients with low-back pain 
by biplanar radiographic measurement of intervertebral motion.

Stokes IA, Wilder DG, Frymoyer JW, Pope MH.

Abnormalities of intervertebral joint motion including hypermobility, reduced 
mobility, torsional abnormality, and displacement of the center of rotation have 
been associated with degenerative change. However, measurement of these signs in 
plane X-ray films is handicapped by the three-dimensional motion and geometry of 
the spine. This study aimed to relate three-dimensional motion of the joints to 
their pathological state. We have used biplanar radiography to measure 
intervertebral motion during voluntary movements by patients with low back pain. 
Primary (or intentional) and coupled motions were measured by a refined 
technique, along with disc shear and facet joint motion. Abnormalities were 
found, especially in the "coupled" motions which were related to narrowed disc 
space, and to proximity to previous fusions. There was asymmetry of motion 
specific to joints with herniated nucleus pulposus.

Computed tomographic findings in lumbar disc disease.

Raskin SP.

Computed tomograph (CT) scans of the lumbar spine performed with a 
high-resolution scanner can demonstrate many of the findings of lumbar disc 
disease, including degeneration, bulging, protrusion, and herniation. Abnormal 
discs may be identified in situ by changes in their attenuation characteristics. 
Herniated disc fragments are readily demonstrated by abnormalities in the 
epidural space. Associated foraminal or central stenosis can be detected, 
providing the surgeon with important information prior to exploration. (Key 
words: computed tomography, lumbar disc disease, low-back pain, spinal 
stenosis.).

Detection and measurement of rheumatoid factor using a new immunoenzyme 
technique with peroxidase/anti-peroxidase complex.

Cohen J, Joyce L, Blanchard F, Etienne JC, Gougeon J, Dropsy GE.

A new, solid-phase enzymatic technique is proposed for the detection and 
measurement of rheumatoid factors (RF). A complex (PAP) consisting of peroxidase 
and rabbit IgG anti-peroxidase antibodies was used as antigen. The sensitivity 
of the technique is such that even "physiological" levels of RF may be detected 
in the majority of serum samples. The intra-assay and inter-assay repeatability 
(6-8% and 12%) is better than that for either of the traditional agglutination 
techniques (latex fixation test and Waaler-Rose reaction, or LWR) and this means 
that the serological evolution of the illness may be followed more accurately 
for each patient. The detection of non-agglutinating RF was also possible. The 
antigen used (i. e. rabbit IgG) was fixed immunologically to the enzyme, hence 
it was not denatured by chemically labelling. This antigen resembles that of the 
Waaler-Rose reaction. A variation of this method enabled the detection of RF 
immunoglobulin class, when only the IgM fraction of the sera tested could be 
fixed to the solid phase by means of anti-mu F(ab')2 antibody before 
introduction of the antigen. The affinity constant could be measured without 
antibody purification. In 211 cases of adult rheumatoid arthritis, abnormally 
high levels of RF were revealed in 78% of the subjects using the PAP technique 
and in only 53% with the agglutination (LWR) techniques. On the other hand, the 
RF levels were within normal limits in the 51 cases of other inflammatory 
rheumatisms lacking RF according to LWR techniques, in 62 cases of 
non-inflammatory diseases (hip osteoarthrosis, low back pain) and also in the 42 
cases of other inflammatory diseases.

Back pain and the radiologist.

Hall FM.

The exact role of the radiologist in assessing patients with low back pain 
remains vague, which is in keeping with this syndrome's uncertain etiology and 
controversial therapy. Conventional radiographs of the lumbosacral spine have a 
limited role in most such patients, primarily in excluding neoplasm, infection, 
or ankylosing spondylitis. This examination can ordinarily be limited to two 
views; and, for radiation and economic reasons, radiographs should usually be 
initially deferred in young patients and/or those with acute symptoms. Symptoms 
will abate in most of these patients, making radiological examination 
unnecessary. Computed tomography (CT) is the method of choice in the diagnosis 
of spinal stenosis and possibly herniated nucleus pulposus and facet joint 
abnormalities as well. Preliminary data showing symptomatic relief of pain 
following facet joint injection could open an entire new area of interventional 
radiology. Confirmatory studies are needed in this exciting and potentially 
important area of investigation.

Computed tomography in sciatica.

Carrera GF, Williams AL, Haughton VM.

Lumber facet arthropathy and a herniated disk are two major causes of low back 
pain and sciatica. The authors evaluated the importance of computed tomography 
(CT) in 243 patients with low back pain and/or sciatica. Lumbar facet 
abnormalities were found in 139 patients (57%), and a herniated disk was found 
in 48 patients (20%). CT findings correlated precisely with surgical 
observations in cases involving a herniated disk and correlated well with the 
results of an intra-articular facet block in a small series of patients. CT can 
effectively diagnose and differentiate between lumbar facet arthropathy and a 
herniated disk.

Incidence of low back pain and pre-placement x-ray screening.

Gibson ES, Martin RH, Terry CW.

The primary purpose of pre-placement back x-ray screening is to reduce the 
incidence of low back problems. This study was designed to address the specific 
question of whether or not this objective is achieved, without directly looking 
at the predictive value of radiological abnormalities of the lumbar spine. Two 
retrospective cohorts of steelworkers were identified: one group hired before, 
and one after, introduction of back x-rays into an otherwise identical 
pre-placement medical examination. The two cohorts were stratified by age and 
work activity, and by use of a modified life table method were followed for 12 
years. All health incidents, modified work, lost time, or permanent job changes 
were noted. Analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between 
cohorts for the parameters studied. The inclusion of low back x-ray screening 
into a comprehensive pre-placement medical examination had no significant effect 
on the subsequent incidence of low back pain in the cohort of steelworkers 
studied.

Computed tomography of the lumbar facet joints.

Carrera GF, Haughton VM, Syvertsen A, Williams AL.

Lumbar facet joints are difficult to image with conventional radiographic 
techniques. A series of 100 consecutive cases of low back pain and sciatica was 
examined with CT. Abnormal facet joints were found in 65. Abnormalities 
demonstrated by CT included osteophyte formation, hypertrophy of articular 
processes, articular cartilage thinning, vacuum joint phenomenon, and 
calcification of the joint capsule. In patients with sciatic or low back pain, 
CT is indicated to demonstrate treatable abnormalities of the facet joints.

Electromyographic abnormalities in osteosarcoma arising in Paget disease of the 
vertebral column.

Reinstein L, Govindan S, Reahl GE Jr, Fazekas VA.

The case of a patient with low back pain and Paget disease of the L5, S1 
vertebrae is presented. Electromyography revealed dysfunction in both the 
paraspinal and gluteal muscles. Postmortem examination showed sarcomatous 
transformation of the vertebrae with nerve root compression and skeletal muscle 
infiltration by tumor. The electromyographic abnormalities are correlated with 
the pathologic findings. The clinical features of neurologic dysfunction in 
Paget disease of the vertebral column and in osteosarcoma arising in Paget 
disease of the vertebral column are reviewed. Electromyography can provide 
valuable information in the evaluation of the patient with Paget disease of the 
vertebral column who is suspected of having neurologic dysfunction.

Total myelography in the evaluation of lumbar discs. With the presentation of 
three cases of thoracic neoplasms simulating nerve root lesions.

Epstein JA, Marc JA, Hyman RA, Khan A, Mardayat M.

It has been our practice to perform total myelography in all cases of lumbar 
disc disease including the various syndromes of spinal stenosis, because 
experience has indicated that myelographic abnormalities in the cervical and 
thoracic areas could have clinical importance despite the presence of gross 
changes in the lumbar region. Failure to establish a definite diagnosis by 
restricted lumbar myelography makes it mandatory to evaluate all levels of the 
spinal axis. Recently, 3 patients with thoracic spinal cord tumors presented 
with primary signs and symptoms of lumbar spine disorders. Evidence of spinal 
cord disease was minimal and could be readily overlooked. Total myelography 
disclosed varying degrees of lumbar spinal pathology, but also showed evidence 
of lesions in the thoracic region. One proved to be an intramedullary 
astrocytoma of the spinal cord, and two were schwannomas. The symptoms of 
low-back pain and lumbar radiculopathy improved after excision of the 
schwannomas and following x-ray therapy and chemotherapy in the patient with the 
intramedullary neoplasm.

Epidemiologic and clinical studies of long-term prognosis of low-back pain and 
sciatica.

Hasue M, Fujiwara M.

In order to justify the selection of therapeutic measures for low-back pain and 
sciatica, epidemiologic and clinical studies were performed of the natural 
histories or the long-term prognosis of those symptoms. The main conclusions 
drawn in relation to decision making are as follows: low-back pain is more 
frequent than sciatica or intermittent claudication, but the latter is more 
disabling; acute attacks are generally more disabling than chronic pain, and the 
frequency may be more closely related to poor prognosis than the duration; 
radiologic findings are of little value in differentiating the incidence and 
degree of the symptoms during life; myelographic or peridurographic 
abnormalities do not always suggest poor prognosis.

Evaluation of sacroiliac joint pathology by quantitative analysis of

examined this technique in 61 patients and controls. The procedure was useful in 
detecting early sacroiliitis but was of limited value in patients with advanced 
sacroiliac joint findings radiographically. False positive values were found in 
patients with metabolic bone disease or structural abnormalities in the low 
back. Normative data must be determined for each laboratory.

Mizoi K, Kodama N, Takaku A.

Three cases of tethered cord syndrome are presented with reference of reported 
literatures. This syndrome is usually associated with spina bifida occulta and 
cutaneous manifestation such as subcutaneous tumor, skin dimple, hairy patch, 
and neavus. Presented symptoms are various progressive neurological deficits 
involving weakness and/or sensory disturbance of lower limbs, bowel and/or 
bladder dysfunction, leg and/or low back pain, and orthopedic pathological 
conditions such as scoliosis and/or foot deformities. Properly performed 
myelography is the only method of preoperative confirmation of this syndrome. As 
the surgical release of the tethered spinal cord is effective for these various 
symptoms except for foot deformity, early investigation and early surgery are 
recommended.

Comparative study of 2 groups matched for age and sex, 39 subjects with B 27 and 
40 subjects without B 27, chosen at random from blood donors, leads to the 
conclusion that the former complain of chronic low back pain and joint 
manifestations, and show a reduction in the range of movement of the lumbar 
spine, significantly more frequently than the latter. While radiological 
abnormalities of the sacro-iliac joints considered individually do not permit 
separation of those bearing the antigen from the controle, grouping them 
together shows that there are more cases of stage III sacro-ilitis among those 
with B 27. In all, 5 cases of spondylitis defined according to the New York 
criteria were found in this way in the group with B 27, 12.8 per cent as against 
3 per cent in the controls. From these results, the incidence of rheumatic 
spondylitis can be estimated as between 0.8 and 1.7 per cent.

Quantitative 99mTc pertechnetate scanning of the sacro-iliac joints. A follow-up 
study of patients with suspected sacro-iliitis.

Szanto E, Lindvall N.

Quantitative 99mTc pertechnetate sacro-iliac scanning (QTPS) was performed in 30 
patients suspected of having sacro-iliac arthritis (SI). Abnormal scanning 
results but lack of definite radiographic changes were noted in all of them. 
Twenty-four of these patients were followed-up for an average of 3.4 years; 
roentgenological abnormalities were found in 23 patients, or 95%, namely 
definite SI in 13, slight abnormalities in 1 previously normal patient, inactive 
changes in 3, suspected SI was unchanged in the radiographs in 5 and regression 
of previously observed grad-I changes was found in 1. In only 1 patient was the 
radiological picture unchanged normal. No definite roentgenological SI developed 
in any of the 12 controls (patients with normal (QTPS) we followed in the same 
way. A close correlation was noted between the QTPS and the patients' complaints 
of low back pain/stiffness and the clinical findings, including the presence of 
HLA-B27. The present study confirms that, despite the absence of radiographic 
changes, QTPS allows identification of a group of clinical and laboratory 
features which together are sufficiently characteristic of SI to establish that 
diagnosis. QTPS also enables us to discover clinically silent SI.

Relation between the low back pain syndrome and x-ray findings. 2. Transitional 
vertebra (mainly sacralization).

Magora A, Schwartz A.

The relation between LBP and transitional vertebra was investigated in 312 
subjects; 148 healthy individuals served as controls. An overall incidence of 
0.65% lumbarization and 20.8% sacralization was found; of the latter, one third 
were partial and two-thirds complete. The incidence was markedly lower in women. 
No direct relation between sacralization, partial or complete, and LBP was 
found; this was based on interrelation of the LBP and control groups, with or 
without sacralization, to age, ethnic community, occupation, number of changes 
of occupation or place of employment, duration of LBP, and physical occupational 
requirements (sitting, standing, bending, sudden maximal effort). There is some 
evidence that LBP, when associated with sacralization, may be more severe.

[The influence of abnormal vertebral column on failure in epidural anaesthesia 
(author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Tolksdorf W, Thürigen W, Lutz H.

In 387 pat., we observed the interdependence of abnormal vertebral column and 
failures in epidural anaesthesia by medial tap with the "los of resistance" 
method. We could show that in contradistinction to other opinions scoliosis 
induces no higher rate of failure of epidural anaesthesia than the normal 
vertebral column. In patients with kyphoscoliosis and ossified ligaments the 
epidural space was identified less frequently than in the normal group, 
perforations of the dura were encountered more frequently. These results are 
statistically significant. In patients who had or have pain in the back (p.e. 
lumbago) and those with ossified ligaments we found significantly more pain 
during operation although analgesia was tested before. In these three 
abnormalities of the vertebral column we recommend to judicously balance 
advantages against disadvantages of epidural anaesthesia and alternative 
anaesthetic procedures.

The transitional vertebra of the lumbosacral spine: its radiological 
classification, incidence, prevalence, and clinical significance.

Tini PG, Wieser C, Zinn WM.

This report presents interim results from a series of studies of the lumbosacral 
region of the spine. A new classification of the lumbosacral transitional 
vertebra (LSTV) is proposed. An LSTV was found with similar frequency in 
patients and in population samples. The radiological findings were related to 
the presence of symptoms and to evidence of urological problems. Whilst Brocher 
(1973), Rubin (1971), and others have considered an LSTV to be of importance 
because it should lead to unfavourable weight bearing in the lower spine, the 
present extensive material shows that there is no relation between an LSTV and 
low backache. There may be a genetic factor involved in the various types of 
LSTV.

Erythema ab igne, a sign of pancreatic disease.

Butler ML.

Patients with abdominal pain resulting from pancreatitis are often misdiagnosed 
initially. There are no pathognomonic physical signs to implicate the pancreas 
as a source of chronic abdominal discomfort. Four patients seen consecutively 
(and one studied retrospectively) illustrate that erythema ab igne of the 
abdomen or low back may be a sign of pancreatitis. These patients had used heat 
on their abdomens or backs in attempts to relieve the pain. Using heat in this 
manner is common among patients with undiagnosed pancreatitis; the heat enhances 
the appearance of the erythema ab igne. The presence of pigmentation is a sign 
of organicity which should lead the physician to investigate the pancreas as a 
source of the patient's pain.

[Anomalies of the pattern of lumbosacral nerve roots and its clinical 
significance (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Agnoli AL.

Twenty personal observations and 18 cases collected from the literature are 
analysed. The most frequently encountered anomaly were: common dural origin of 2 
nerve roots and common exit of 2 nerve roots through the intervertebral foramen. 
Other anomalies comprised: interradicular connections and Y-shaped or horizontla 
course of the nerve root. Multiple anomalies were not encountered. In 9 out of 
20 patients in the own series and in 6 out of 18 patients reported in the 
literature, history and clinical findings suggested prolapsed intervertebral 
disc, operation revealed only nerve root anomalies. Decompression produced 
improvement or complete relieve of previously existing signs and plain X-rays is 
not possible. The diagnosis is based on myelographic findings. The pathogenesis 
of the anomalies is discussed. It is suggested that they should not be 
considered as a causative factor of low back pain or sciatica.

Rehabilitation of patients with low back disorders in the County of Uppsala.

Hilding S, Hedqvist H, Arbman B, Wigren A.

Low back pain is a common cause of inability to work. At the Rehabilitation 
Centre of the Uppsala County Council an annual number of more than 100 patients 
with this condition undergo an investigation aimed at evaluating their capacity 
for work and their need for rehabilitation. By compiling and analysing the 
information recorded in the case journals of the patients with low back 
disorders during the years 1969 to 1971, it was hoped that more knowledge would 
be gained about the factors constituting a hindrance to rehabilitation. The 
present paper is a preliminary report on an analysis of 47 case journals 
unsystematically selected from the entire material. The study verifies a number 
of previously reported observations, e.g. the low frequency of roentgenological 
changes. It is also noted that in a remarkably large number of patients no or 
only slight abnormalities were found on physical examination. Compared with the 
results of other investigations, there was a very low frequency of concurrent 
psychiatric disorders and abuse of alcohol. It was considered from this analysis 
that the information in the case journal material in question is adequate for 
elucidating the relevant problems in the planned larger investigation; further, 
it provides motivation for a future follow-up study.
