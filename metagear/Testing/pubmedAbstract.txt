Medical Sciences, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.

RATIONALE: Available literature states that the histological subtype of the 
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with pulmonary metastasis is often spindle 
cell type. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the GIST with pulmonary 
metastasis of very uncommon epithelioid subtype.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a 63-year-old male presenting with the symptom of 
bloodstained sputum without obvious inducement. The patient had no chest pain, 
low back pain, fatigue, fever or night sweats symptoms.
DIAGNOSES: Combined chest digital radiography and the history of the patient who 
presented with the colon GIST of the epithelioid subtype two years ago that the 
mass may be a metastasis tumor. Combined with morphological and 
immunohistochemical staining results, a pathological diagnosis of the GIST with 
pulmonary metastasis was considered.
INTERVENTIONS: Right lobectomy and partial upper lobectomy were performed.
OUTCOMES: The patient had not experienced any noticeable symptom and recurrent 
tumors at 6 months follow-up.
LESSONS: We report a rare case of the GIST with pulmonary metastasis of 
epithelioid subtype. This case is of great significance to the pathologist's 
clinical work. For pathologists, if an epithelioid tumor in the lung is found, 
it is necessary to check whether the gastrointestinal tract also has the tumor, 
which may be an epithelioid GIST with pulmonary metastasis.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional comparative study.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between the 
FR phenomenon asymmetry of lumbar muscles and trunk lateral range of motion 
(ROM) asymmetry in nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) patients.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Imbalance in trunk muscle activation between right 
and left sides can induce pain by loading the spine incorrectly, especially in 
patients with NSCLBP. A previous study reported a greater asymmetry in the FR 
phenomenon of the erector spinae in NSCLBP patients than in asymptomatic 
participants (APs). Imbalance of muscle properties, such as trunk ROM, has been 
suggested as a possible cause of this observed asymmetry.
METHODS: Twenty-eight NSCLBP patients and 22 AP performed 3 standing maximal 
trunk flexions. Surface electromyography was recorded bilaterally for erector 
spinae longissimus and lumbar multifidus. A FR ratio was calculated for each 
muscle. The fingertip-to-thigh test was performed to assess trunk lateral ROM. 
Each parameter's asymmetry was calculated as the absolute difference between 
right and left sides.
RESULTS: NSCLBP patients present a significantly lower trunk lateral ROM than 
AP. FR ratio asymmetry of the erector spinae was significantly greater in NSCLBP 
patients than in AP (P < 0.05). FR ratio asymmetry of the multifidus and trunk 
lateral ROM asymmetry were not significantly different between groups. 
Significant correlation (r = 0.49) between FR ratio asymmetry of erector spinae 
and trunk lateral ROM asymmetry was observed only for patients with NSCLBP.
CONCLUSION: The present findings showed that FR ratio asymmetry of erector 
spinae longissimus is moderately correlated with trunk lateral ROM asymmetry. In 
addition, the results confirmed that patients with NSCLBP present a reduced 
trunk lateral ROM, a FR ratio asymmetry of the erector spinae which is 
correlated with trunk rotation. These findings suggested an imbalance spine 
loading which can contribute to the persistence of pain.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation into the dural space is a very rare 
phenomenon of degenerative lumbar lesions in the elderly population, and its 
potential pathogenesis and natural course remain unclear.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a rare case of intradural lumbar disc herniation. 
A 68-year-old man presented with progressive lower back pain and radiating pain 
and numbness in both legs for 3 years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 
large herniated disc at L4-L5. Posterior discectomy and fusion of the L4-L5 was 
performed after conservative treatment failed. Intraoperatively, only minimal 
disc fragments in the epidural space were found after meticulous probing 
following laminectomy of the L4-L5 vertebrae. The dorsal dura mater was 
saturated, tense, and bulged at the L4-L5 levels; additionally, an intradural 
mass was palpable and confirmed by intraoperative ultrasonography. Subsequently, 
dorsal middle durotomy was performed. Upon opening the dural sac, a large 
cauliflower-like mass similar to nucleus pulposus tissue was found near the 
arachnoid membrane. The mass was dissociative and could be completely resected. 
The dorsal dural incisions were closed after careful exploration, followed by 
fixation and fusion of the L4-L5 levels. Pathological examination revealed disc 
tissue with central balloon-type cystic degenerative changes. The patient's 
lower back pain and radiating pain and numbness of both legs improved remarkably 
postoperatively, and he became asymptomatic at 3 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Intradural lumbar disc herniation should be highly suspected when 
intraoperative findings are incompatible with findings from the preoperative 
imaging examination, and it could be further confirmed via intraoperative 
ultrasonography and pathological examination of the resected tissue from the 
dural space. Prompt surgery is recommended, and surgical results are usually 
favorable. We also reviewed the literature and discussed the potential 
pathogenesis, natural course, diagnosis, and treatment of intradural lumbar disc 
herniation.

BACKGROUND: Spontaneous conus medullaris infarction is a rare disease. We 
describe two patients with spontaneous conus medullaris infarction presenting as 
acute cauda equina syndrome and their unique electromyography (EMG) findings.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two patients developed acute low back pain with mild 
asymmetric paraparesis, loss of perianal sensation and sphincter dysfunction. 
Ankle deep tendon reflexes were reduced in bilaterally. Neither patient had 
cardiovascular risk factors. Magnetic Resonance imaging showed infarction in the 
conus medullaris. Functional recovery was good in both patients, but progressive 
asymmetric calf wasting and sphincter dysfunction remained. EMG studies at 
follow-up of at least 3 years demonstrate active denervation at the muscles 
innervated by the first sacrum anterior horn cells.
CONCLUSION: Spontaneous conus medullaris infarction can occur in healthy 
individuals and presents as cauda equina syndrome. Findings of needle EMG 
studies indicate a progressive course of sacrum anterior horn cell disorder 
during long-term follow-up.

Clinical results of intradiscal hydrogel administration (GelStix) in lumbar 
degenerative disc disease.

Ceylan A, Aşik I, Özgencil GE, Erken B.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is one of the main causes of 
lower back pain. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous 
intradiscal GelStix administration in patients with discogenic pain due to 
lumbar DDD who were unresponsive to conservative methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 29 patients were included in the study, which 
took place between 2013 and 2017. Sedation was performed in the prone position 
in the operating room, and a C-arm was located so as to provide a lateral view 
of the surgical field. A 22-G, 3.5-inch needle was inserted into the center of 
the disc under fluoroscopy guidance, and a percutaneous intradiscal GelStix 
implantation was performed. All patients were evaluated using the Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and after 
treatment, and using the Patient Satisfaction Scale at 12 months following 
treatment.
RESULTS: The mean VAS scores were 7.14 ± 0.64 at baseline and 2.48 ± 0.63 at 12 
months (P < 0.001). The mean ODI scores were 28.14 ± 1.81 at baseline and 17.35 
± 0.67 at 12 months (P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant decrease 
in the VAS and ODI scores before and after treatment. A total of 86.2% of the 
patients rated the procedure as very good or good at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that GelStix treatment is useful in pain 
relief in patients with DDD from the first month of treatment.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical effect of the limited area 
decompression, intervertebral fusion, and pedicle screw fixation for treating 
degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) with instability. Hemilaminectomy 
decompression, intervertebral fusion, and pedicle screw fixation for treating 
DLSS with instability as the control group.Follow-up of 54 patients (26 males 
and 28 females; average age, 59.74 ± 10.38 years) with DLSS with instability 
treated by limited area decompression, intervertebral fusion, and pedicle screw 
fixation (LIFP group), and 52 patients as control group with hemilaminectomy 
decompression, intervertebral fusion, and pedicle screw fixation (HIFP group). 
We assessed clinical effect according to the patients' functional outcome 
grading (good to excellent, fair, or poor), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and 
visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back pain and lower limb pain, which was 
administered preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Fusion 
status was assessed by radiologists at the last follow-up. Treatment 
satisfaction was assessed according to the subjective evaluations of the 
patients.At the 12-month follow-up, 96.2% (52/54) and 90.3% (47/52) of group 
LIFP and HIFP belonged to good to excellent outcome categories, respectively, 
while 3.7% (2/54) and 9.6% (5/52) of group LIFP and HIFP belonged to fair 
respectively, neither group belonged to poor. Satisfaction rates of patients in 
group LIFP and group HIFP were 98.1% (53/54) and 92.3% (48/52), respectively. 
The patients' functional outcome grading and satisfaction rate in group LIFP 
were better than that in group HIFP. The VAS for low back and lower limb pain 
and the ODI improved significantly during the 12 months after surgery (all 
P < .001) in 2 groups. The VAS for low back and lower limb pain were no 
difference between two groups, however, the ODI of group LIFP was lower than 
that of group HIFP (P < .001). All patients achieved radiological fusion.The 
limited area decompression, intervertebral fusion, and pedicle screw fixation 
had a satisfactory effect on patients with DLSS with instability.

Percutaneous epidural neuroplasty (PEN) is an effective interventional treatment 
for radicular pain. However, in some cases, contrast runoff to the spinal nerve 
root does not occur. We investigated whether contrast runoff to the spinal nerve 
root affects the success rate of PEN and whether additional transforaminal 
epidural blocks for intentional contrast runoff affect the success rate of PEN 
in cases in which contrast runoff is absent.This study was registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03867630) in March 2019. We reviewed the 
medical records of 112 patients who underwent PEN with a wire-type catheter from 
May 2016 to August 2018. Patients were divided in 3 groups (Runoff group, 
Non-runoff group, Transforaminal group).Patients with low back pain and leg 
radicular pain who did not respond to lumbar epidural steroid injectionsPEN was 
performed in 112 patients with a wire-type catheter in target segment. We 
compared the success rate of PEN betweenThe success rate was significantly 
different between the Runoff group and the Non-runoff group (P < .0007) and 
between the Non-runoff group and the Transforaminal group (P = .0047), but not 
between the Runoff group and the Transforaminal group (P = .57).Contrast runoff 
influenced the success rate of PEN. In cases without contrast runoff, additional 
transforaminal epidural blocks for intentional contrast runoff increased the 
success rate of PEN with a wire-type catheter.

RATIONALE: Rare cases of reactive arthritis induced by active extra-articular 
tuberculosis (Poncet disease) have been reported. Complete response to 
antitubercular treatment and evidence of active extra-articular tuberculosis are 
the most important clinical features of Poncet disease. We report the case of 
successfully treated a patient with reactive arthritis induced by active 
extra-articular tuberculosis with a TNF inhibitor after sufficient 
antitubercular treatment.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our department with 
polyarthralgia, low back pain, and high fever. The results of rheumatoid factor, 
anti-citrullinated protein antibody, human leukocyte antigen B27, and the assays 
for the detection of infections (with an exception of T-SPOT.TB) were all 
negative. Fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) 
showed moderate uptake in the right cervical, right supraclavicular, 
mediastinal, and abdominal lymph nodes. As magnetic resonance imaging and power 
Doppler ultrasonography showed peripheral inflammation (tendinitis, 
tenosynovitis, ligamentitis, and enthesitis in the limbs).
DIAGNOSIS: A diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was eventually established 
on the basis of lymph node biopsy results. There was no evidence of a bacterial 
infection including acid-fast bacteria in his joints, and the symptoms of 
polyarthralgia and low back pain were improved but not completely resolved with 
NSAID therapy; in addition, a diagnosis of reactive arthritis induced by active 
extraarticular tuberculosis was made.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient experienced persistent peripheral inflammation 
despite antitubercular treatment for more than nine months and was then 
successfully treated with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (adalimumab 40 mg 
every 2 weeks).
OUTCOMES: Finally, the patient responded to the treatment and has been in 
remission for over 4 months as of this writing.
LESSONS: In patients who present with symptoms associated with 
spondyloarthritis, it is important to distinguish between classic reactive 
arthritis and reactive arthritis induced by extra-articular tuberculosis 
infection. Introduction of biological agents should be carefully considered in 
settings where reactive arthritis induced by active extra-articular tuberculosis 
shows progression to chronicity despite sufficient antitubercular treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a medical condition characterized by the 
narrowing of the spinal canal as a consequence of bone and soft tissue 
degeneration, including disc herniation, facet and ligamentum flavum 
hypertrophy, and osteophyte formation. The percutaneous transforaminal 
endoscopic discectomy (PTED) technique is one of the emerging surgical 
alternatives for treating central lumbar stenosis. The present study aims to 
describe the present techniques of PTED and foraminoplasty for central lumbar 
stenosis, and discuss the feasibility and advantages of this technique.
METHODS: A total of 55 patients with an average age of 50 years were recruited 
in this study. They were operated on between August 2017 and June 2018 by a 
single surgeon for symptomatic lumbar stenosis using the PTED and foraminoplasty 
technique, along with a detailed description of the present technique. The 
retrospective analysis of 55 patients operated between August 2017 and June 2018 
by a single surgeon for symptomatic lumbar stenosis using the PTED and 
foraminoplasty techniques, and the detailed description of the present technique 
were the focus of the present study. For all patients, the PTED and 
foraminoplasty procedure was performed under local anesthesia in the lateral 
position on a radiolucent table using C-arm fluoroscopy. The retrospective 
analysis evaluated the outcomes of symptoms through follow-up interviews at six 
weeks, six months, and one year after surgery. The analyzed parameters included 
surgery time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, visual 
analog scale (VAS) score, Japan Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, and the 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The modified MacNab criteria were adopted.
RESULTS: The average duration of symptoms was 15.6 weeks. The mean operative 
time was 161 minutes. The mean volume of intraoperative blood loss was 21 mL. 
The mean follow-up period was 14.6 months. The average preoperative VAS score 
for leg pain and low back pain was 6.8 and 5.5, respectively. The preoperative 
ODI and JOA score was 49.2 and 14.6, respectively. At the final follow-up, all 
55 patients had an average VAS score of 1.1 for leg pain and 0.5 for low back 
pain. At the same time, the average ODI and JOA score was seven and 24.5, 
respectively. The statistical analysis showed that the VAS score, ODI value, and 
JOA score were significantly lower in all time-points at post-operation, when 
compared to those at pre-operation. For the modified MacNab criteria, the final 
outcome results were excellent in 39 patients (70.9%), good in nine patients 
(16.4%), fair in four patients (7.3%), and poor in two patients (3.6%), and the 
overall success rate was 89.1%. Two patients underwent a second operation during 
the follow-up period, and their symptoms were released after the reoperation.
CONCLUSION: PTED and foraminoplasty technique showed promising outcomes in the 
treatment of central lumbar stenosis in a 1-year follow-up period. It suggested 
that PTED and foraminoplasty might be applied as a safe and effective 
therapeutic option for patients with lumbar stenosis.

OBJECTIVE: Although osteoporosis commonly appears among postmenopausal women, it 
is rarely diagnosed during the postpartum period as pregnancy-lactation 
associated osteoporosis (PAO). The aim of the study reported here was to 
investigate low bone mineral density and its associated risk factors in 
postpartum women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 93 females aged 18-40 years and 
in the first month of the postpartum period. All the women had low back pain. 
The bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score values of the lumbar vertebrae, femur 
(neck and total) were examined using dual energy x-ray absorbtiometry four weeks 
after birth. Patients body mass index (BMI), 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25-OHD) levels 
and complete blood counts were recorded. Participants were divided into two 
groups to their Z scores: the normal group (n = 71) and the low BMD group 
(n = 22).
RESULTS: The 25-OHD levels were significantly lower (p = .02) in the low BMD 
group [4.45 (4.0-12.4)] than in the control group [22 (12-48)], however, NLR and 
PLR values were similar between groups. BMI positively correlated with BMD 
scores for the lumbar, femoral neck and femoral overall (p = .011, p = .026 and 
p = .026, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency and BMI may play a critical role in PAO. Low 
back pain during postpartum period should be carefully evaluated. Adequate 
calcium and vitamin D supplementation may prevent possible bone loss.
