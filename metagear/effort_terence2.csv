The first purpose of this report is to give an overview of the distribution of these factors among the different taxonomical bacterial divisions and to determine the degree of conservation of the main structural features of the PLP binding domain. Complete proteomes of bacteria phyla were scanned with a hidden Markov model representative of the MocR family. Results indicate that presence of MocR factors is heterogeneous even within the single bacterial phylum: some species miss completely the factors, while others possess one or even more regulators. Absence of MocR factors is distinctive of some phyla such as Chlamydiae. The genomic distribution of MocR is, as expected, highly correlated to the size of the genome. At variance, phyla missing MocR regulators generally are characterized by compact genomes, of the order of 1.0-2.0 Mb, such as the case of Mollicutes or Chlamydiae. Apparently, the minimum genome size compatible with the presence of MocR genes is around 2.0-2.5 Mb. Conservation of the residues corresponding to those involved in the interaction with the cofactor pyridoxa1-5'-phosphate in the homologous 2-aminoadipate aminotransferase, was analyzed in the multiple sequence alignments of MocR within each phyla considered. In the vast majority of cases, residues are conserved or conservatively replaced. This result suggests that, in most cases, MocR factors preserve at least ability to bind the cofactor and very likely some catalytic abilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We develop exploitation-extinction theory for a mammal life history using R-0 < 1 as N goes to zero, and combine the criterion with several facts about mammal life histories.Conclusions: Extinction results if the ratio of the instantaneous mortality rate caused by hunting (F) divided by the adult instantaneous mortality rate (M, for the unexploited population) exceeds a critical value (F/M > C). The C value is determined mostly by the level of recruitment compensation as N declines, and C is likely very similar for different sized mammals. We use existing mammal life-history data to estimate C (-0.5). We then estimate the threshold of instantaneous mortality rate, F, as a function of adult body mass, W; it's a -0.25 power allometry. Finally, we extend the model to fish. C is expected to vary a lot between fish species, mostly because fish are expected to have much larger recruitment compensation than mammals, the recruitment may correlate with body size, and immature fish are often not exploited. We show how to combine these to predict C."
