abstract = {Human lumbar motion segment is composed of various components with distinct contributions to its gross mechanical response. By employing experimental and computational approaches, many studies have investigated the relative role of each component as well as effects of various factors such as boundary-initial conditions, load magnitude-combination-direction, load temporal regime, preload, posture, degeneration, failures and surgical interventions on load-sharing. This paper reviews and critically discusses the relevant findings of in vitro and finite element model studies on load-sharing in healthy, aged, degenerate and damaged human lumbar motion segments. Two systematic searches were performed in PubMed (October 2018 - March 2019) using three sets of concepts (“lumbar spine”, “load-sharing” and “motion segment components”) followed by a complementary generic search. The segment overall response as well as the relative role of its constituents are markedly influenced by alterations in resection sequence, boundary conditions, geometry, loading characteristics (rate, magnitude, combinations and preloads), disc hydration, bone quality, posture and time (creep and cyclic). Structural transection order affects both findings and conclusions not only in force-control protocols but also in displacement-control loading regimes. Disc degeneration, endplate fracture and surgical resections significantly alter load transmission in the lumbar spine. In summary, in vitro and finite element model studies have together substantially improved our understanding of functional biomechanics (load-sharing) of human lumbar spine in normal and perturbed conditions acting as invaluable complementary tools in clinical applications.},

abstract = {Study Design. Investigation of the effects of the impairment of different nutritional pathways on the intervertebral disc degeneration patterns in terms of spatial distributions of cell density, glycosaminoglycan content, and water content. Objective. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that impairment of different nutritional pathways would result in different degenerative patterns in human discs. Summary of Background Data. Impairment of nutritional pathways has been found to affect cell viability in the disc. However, details on how impairment of different nutritional pathways affects the disc degeneration patterns are unknown. Methods. A 3D finite element model was used for this study. This finite element method was based on the cell-activity coupled mechano-electrochemical theory for cartilaginous tissues. Impairment of the nutritional pathways was simulated by lowering the nutrition level at the disc boundaries. Effects of the impartment of cartilaginous endplate-nucleus pulposus (CEP-NP) pathway only (Case 1), annulus fibrosus (AF) pathway only (Case 2), and both pathways (Case 3) on disc degeneration patterns were studied. Results. The predicted critical levels of nutrition for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 were around 30{\%}, 20{\%}, and 50{\%} of the reference values, respectively. Below this critical level, the disc degeneration would occur. Disc degeneration appeared mainly in the NP for Case 1, in the outer AF for Case 2, and in both the NP and inner to middle AF for Case 3. For Cases 1 and 3, the loss of water content was primarily located in the mid-axial plane, which is consistent with the horizontal gray band seen in some T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the disc geometry used in this study, it was predicted that there existed a high-intensity zone (for Case 3), as seen in some T2- weighted MRI images. Conclusion. Impairment of different nutrition pathways results in different degenerative patterns.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive way of measuring muscular oxygenation. We evaluated the relationship between NIRS signal [infrared muscle oxygen saturation (IR-SO(2 mus))] and the femoral venous oxygen saturation (Sfv(O2)) during cycling exercise. Six healthy subjects performed a 30-min steady-state exercise at 80{\%} maximal oxygen uptake in normoxia and hypoxia (inspired O2 fraction = 0.105). IR-SO(2 mus) was recorded continuously throughout the tests with the NIRS probe located on the vastus lateralis. During exercise, blood samples were withdrawn every 5 min from radial artery and femoral vein catheters. In normoxia, IR-So(2 mus) initiated a transient nonsignificant decrease at 5 min, then returned to preexercise level, whereas Sfv(O2) showed a fast decrease, reaching 18{\%} saturation at 10 min without further change. By contrast, in hypoxia, IR- SO(2 mus) and Sfv(O2) demonstrated a parallel decrease then stabilized at 10 min. We conclude that IR-So(2 mus) appears to parallel Sfv(O2) when both the arterial and venous oxygen contents decrease during steady-state exercise in hypoxia, whereas IR-SO(2 mus) does not follow Sfv(O2) change in normoxia.},

abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a noninvasive technique that uses the differential absorption properties of hemoglobin to evaluate skeletal muscle oxygenation. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorb light equally at 800 nm, whereas at 760 nm absorption is primarily from deoxygenated hemoglobin. Therefore, monitoring these two wavelengths provides an index of deoxygenation. To investigate whether venous oxygen saturation and absorption between 760 and 800 nm (760-800 nm absorption) are correlated, both were measured during forearm exercise. Significant correlations were observed in all subjects (r = 0.92 ± 0.07; P {\textless} 0.05). The contribution of skin flow to the changes in 760-800 nm absorption was investigated by simultaneous measurement of skin flow by laser flow Doppler and NIR recordings during hot water immersion. Changes in skin flow but not 760-800 nm absorption were noted. Intra-arterial infusions of nitroprusside and norepinephrine were performed to study the effect of alteration of muscle perfusion on 760-800 nm absorption. Limb flow was measured with venous plethysmography. Percent oxygenation increased with nitroprusside and decreased with norepinephrine. Finally, the contribution of myoglobin to the 760-800 nm absorption was assessed by using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At peak exercise, percent NIR deoxygenation during exercise was 80 ± 7{\%}, but only one subject exhibited a small deoxygenated myoglobin signal. In conclusion, 760-800 nm absorption is 1) closely correlated with venous oxygen saturation, 2) minimally affected by skin blood flow, 3) altered by changes in limb perfusion, and 4) primarily derived from deoxygenated hemoglobin and not myoglobin.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify muscle deoxygenation in human skeletal muscles using near infrared time-resolved spectroscopy (NIRTRS) and compare NIRTRS indicators and blood saturation. The forearm muscles of five healthy males (aged 27-32 yrs.) were monitored for changes in hemoglobin saturation (SO2) during 12 min of arterial occlusion and recovery. SO2 was determined by measuring the temporal profile of photon diffusion at 780 and 830 nm using NIRTRS, and was defined as SO2-TRS. Venous blood samples were also obtained for measurements of SvO2, and PvO2. Interstitial PO2(PintO2) was monitored by placing an O2 electrode directly into the muscle tissue. Upon the initiation of occlusion, all parameters fell progressively until reaching a plateau in the latter half of occlusion. It was observed at the end of occlusion that SO2-TRS (24.1 +/- 5.6{\%}) agreed with SvO2 (26.2 +/- 6.4) and that PintO2 (14.7 +/- 1.0 Torr) agreed with PvO2 (17.3 +/- 2.2 Torr). The resting O2 store (oxygenated hemoglobin) and O2 consumption rate were 290 microM and 0.82 microM s-1, respectively, values which reasonably agree with the reported results. These results indicate that there was no O2 gradient between vessels and interstisium at the end of occlusion.},

abstract = {Study Design. A prospective cohort study evaluating the quantitative lumbar flexion-relaxation phenomenon (QLFRP), measured with surface electromyographic (SEMG) signals from the erector spinae during trunk flexion pre- and postrehabilitation, in patients with chronic disabling occupational lumbar disorders (CDOLD). ObjectiveS. To assess the responsiveness of the QLFRP in documenting change in functional performance during a functional restoration program for CDOLD patients. Summary of Background Data. A recent theoretical construct suggests that QLFRP is responsive to change in lumbar range of motion (ROM) during rehabilitation, with high sensitivity and specificity for abnormal QLFRP predicting ROM. Methods. A cohort of normal subjects was tested for QLFRP correlated to inclinometric lumbar ROM measures. The cutoff score was applied to a group of CDOLD patients entering a functional restoration program (N = 135), and to program completers (N = 104). Pain and functional self-report scores were compared with SEMG and ROM measures. Results. The CDOLD group averaged 23.7 months off work. Surgical treatment was provided prerehabilitation to 51{\%} of patients, with 29{\%} receiving lumbar fusions. From pre- to post-treatment, achievement of QLFRP rose from 31{\%} to 74{\%} of patients, while normal ROM rose from 8{\%} to 63{\%} of patients. Compared to the 16{\%} of patients still demonstrating both abnormal QLFRP and ROM, the other groups showed significantly greater improvement in self-reported pain and function, with the best improvements occurring in patients showing normal ROM and QLFRP. The QLFRP showed high sensitivity, but only modest predictive validity and specificity for predicting ROM postrehabilitation. Improvement in sensitivity and predictive validity occur when surgical cases were excluded from the analysis. Conclusion. A majority of patients in an interdisciplinary functional restoration program failed to demonstrate either the QLFRP or normal ROM on admission to the program. A majority of program completers, however, achieved both normal ROM and QLFRP and another 30{\%} demonstrated either normal QLFRP or normal ROM. Both QLFRP and ROM measures were responsive to relevant self-report scales. {\textcopyright} 2009, Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Study Design.: Systematic review. Objective.: To identify, describe, and evaluate common outcome measures in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Summary of Background DATA.: The treatment of CLBP has been associated with multiple clinical challenges. Further complicating this is the myriad of outcome scores used to assess treatment of CLBP. These scores have been used to examine different domains of patient satisfaction and quality of life in the literature. Critical assessment of the frequency, parity, and the quality of these outcomes are essential to improve our understanding of CLBP. Methods.: A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken for articles published from January 2001 through December 31, 2010. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify measures used to evaluate outcomes in six different domains in patients with CLBP. The titles and abstracts of the peer-reviewed literature of LBP were searched to determine which of these measures were most commonly reported in the literature and which have been validated in populations with CLBP. Results.: We identified 75 outcome measures cited to evaluate CLBP. Twenty-nine of these outcome measures were excluded because of only a single citation leaving 46 measures for the evaluation. The most commonly used functional outcomes were the Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Index, and range of motion. For pain, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Pain Disability Index, McGill Pain Questionnaire, and visual analog scale were most commonly cited. For psychosocial function, the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and Beck Depression Inventory were most commonly used. For generic quality of life, short form 36, Nottingham Health Profile, short form 12, and Sickness Impact Profile were the most common measures. For objective measures, the work status/return to work, complications or adverse events, and medications used were the most commonly cited. For preference-based measures, the Euro-Quol 5 dimensions and short form 6 dimensions were most commonly cited. The validity, reliability, responsiveness, universality, and potential proprietary requirements are summarized for each. Conclusion.: Outcome measures should be routinely assessed in patients with CLBP. The choice of appropriate outcome measure should be influenced by the study objectives and design, as well as properties of the particular measure within the context of CLBP. Clinical Recommendations.: Recommendation 1: When selecting the appropriate outcome measures for clinical or research purposes, consider domains that best measure what are most important to patients. Measures that are valid, reliable, and responsive to change should be considered first. Other considerations include the number of items required (especially in the context of multiple measures), whether the measure is validated in the relevant language, and the associated costs or fees. Strength: StrongRecommendation 2: Domains of greatest importance include pain, function, and quality of life. If cost utilization is a priority, then preference-based measures should be considered. For pain, we recommend the VAS and NRPS because of their ease of administration and responsiveness. For function, we recommend the ODI and RMDQ. The SF-36 and its shorter versions are most commonly used and should be considered if quality of life is important. If cost utility is important, consider the EQ-5D or SF-6D. Psychosocial tests are best used as screening tools prior to surgery because of their lack of responsiveness. Complications should always be assessed as a standard of clinical practice. Return to work and medication use are complicated outcome measures and not recommended unless the specific study question is focused on these domains. Consider staff and patient burden when prioritizing one's battery of measures. {\textcopyright} 2011, Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the available literature on structural and functional brain abnormalities in chronic low back pain (CLBP) using several brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Methods: PubMed and Web of Science were systematically screened for relevant literature using different combinations of keywords regarding structural and functional brain imaging techniques in patients with CLBP. Reference lists of included articles were hand-searched for additional literature. Eligible articles were assessed on risk of bias and reviewed by two independent researchers. Results: The search query returned 27 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality varied from poor to good. A total of 10 studies evaluated structural gray matter changes. There is conflicting evidence in global gray matter changes, with both increases and decreases shown in different studies. Gray matter changes were demonstrated in specific brain regions. Structural white matter changes were reported in five studies. There is conflicting evidence in total white matter volume due to both increases and unchanged white matter. Several regional differences were identified in which white matter changes were shown. Functional organization during rest was evaluated in 10 studies. CLBP patients showed increased activation in specific regions, together with a disrupted default mode network. A total of six studies evaluated brain activity in response to a nociceptive stimulus. Findings suggest that patients demonstrated increased activity in pain-related regions, and decreased activity in analgesic regions. Conclusions: Overall, there is moderate evidence for regional changes in gray and white matter, together with an altered functional connectivity during rest and increased activity in pain-related areas following painful stimulation, evidencing an upregulated pain matrix. More longitudinal research is needed to clarify the temporal relationship regarding pain and neuroplastic changes, and integration of different brain imaging techniques is warranted.},

abstract = {Background context Disc degeneration (DD) reportedly causes low back pain (LBP) and is often observed concomitantly with end plate signal change (ESC) and/or Schmorl node (SN) on magnetic resonance imaging. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the association between DD and LBP, considering ESC and/or SN presence, in a large population study. Study design/setting Cross-sectional population-based study in two regions of Japan. Patient sample Of 1,011 possible participants, data from 975 participants (324 men, 651 women; mean age, 66.4 years; range, 21-97 years) were included. Outcome measures Prevalence of DD, ESC, and SN alone and in combination in the lumbar region and the association of these prevalence levels with LBP. Methods Sagittal T2-weighted images were used to assess the intervertebral spaces between L1-L2 and L5-S1. Disc degeneration was classified using the Pfirrmann classification system (grades 4 and 5 indicated degeneration); ESC was defined as a diffuse high signal change along either area of the end plate, and SN was defined as a small well-defined herniation pit with a surrounding wall of hypointense signal. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for LBP in the presence of radiographic changes in the lumbar region and at each lumbar intervertebral level, compared with patients without radiographic change, after adjusting for age, body mass index, and sex. Results The prevalence of lumbar structural findings was as follows: DD alone, 30.4{\%}; ESC alone, 0.8{\%}; SN alone, 1.5{\%}; DD and ESC, 26.6{\%}; DD and SN, 12.3{\%}; and DD, ESC, and SN, 19.1{\%}. These lumbar structural findings were significantly associated with LBP in the lumbar region overall, as follows: DD, ESC, and SN, OR 2.17, 95{\%} CI 1.2-3.9; L1-L2, OR 6.00, 95{\%} CI 1.9-26.6; L4-L5, OR 2.56, 95{\%} CI 1.4-4.9; and L5-S1, OR 2.81, 95{\%} CI 1.1-2.3. The combination of DD and ESC was significantly associated with LBP as follows: L3-L4, OR 2.43, 95{\%} CI 1.5-4.0; L4-L5, OR 1.82, 95{\%} CI 1.2-2.8; and L5-S1, OR 1.60, 95{\%} CI 1.1-2.3. Conclusions Our data suggest that DD alone is not associated with LBP. By contrast, the combination of DD and ESC was highly associated with LBP.},

abstract = {Objective: To analyze muscle activation patterns during various footplate perturbations, used as proprioceptive challenges in patients with low back pain (LBP) and in controls. Design: A prospective and controlled comparative study. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Twenty subjects with chronic LBP and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Interventions: The subjects underwent 5 sets of footplate perturbations in 3 directions with 16 perturbations for each set. Main Outcome Measures: Latency, frequency, and asymmetry of muscle activation of the erector spinae, rectus abdominus, anterior tibialis, and gastrocnemius muscles were measured bilaterally with surface electromyography. Results: In the toes-up movements, subjects with LBP were significantly less likely to activate their rectus abdominus muscles (P=.02), and they were more likely to exhibit asymmetric muscle activation in the smaller forward movements (odds ratio=4.1, P=.03). The latter result appears to be driven by asymmetric contraction of the erector spinae and rectus abdominus. Conclusions: Significantly more subjects with LBP than control subjects exhibited absent firing of trunk muscles during 2 of the 5 footplate perturbations. These results suggest an abnormality of the neuromuscular loop and may represent altered proprioception. {\textcopyright} 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},
