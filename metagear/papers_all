abstract = {{Prospective longitudinal study. To determine whether systemic cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) during an acute episode of low back pain (LBP) differ between individuals who did and did not recover by 6 months and to identify sub-groups based on patterns of inflammatory, psychological, and sleep features associated with recovery/non-recovery. Systemic inflammation is observed in chronic LBP and may contribute to the transition from acute to persistent LBP. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether changes present early or develop over time. Psychological and/or sleep-related factors may be related. Individuals within 2 weeks of onset of acute LBP (N = 109) and pain-free controls (N = 55) provided blood for assessment of CRP, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β, and completed questionnaires related to pain, disability, sleep, and psychological status. LBP participants repeated measurements at 6 months. Biomarkers were compared between LBP and control participants at baseline, and in longitudinal (baseline/6 months) analysis, between unrecovered (≥pain and disability), partially recovered (reduced pain and/or disability) and recovered (no pain and disability) participants at 6 months. We assessed baseline patterns of inflammatory, psychological, sleep, and pain data using hierarchical clustering and related the clusters to recovery (\% change in pain) at 6 months. CRP was higher in acute LBP than controls at baseline. In LBP, baseline CRP was higher in the recovered than non-recovered groups. Conversely, TNF was higher at both time-points in the non-recovered than recovered groups. Two sub-groups were identified that associated with more (“inflammatory/poor sleep”) or less (“high TNF/depression”) recovery. This is the first evidence of a relationship between an “acute-phase” systemic inflammatory response and recovery at 6 months. High inflammation (CRP/IL-6) was associated with good recovery, but specific elevation of TNF, along with depressive symptoms, was associated with bad recovery. Depression and TNF may have a two-way relationship. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.}},

abstract = {{ Background Myofascial release (MFR) is used to restore tissue extensibility of the fascia tissue and is considered to be useful in a number of clinical settings such as low back pain, ankle injuries, fibromyalgia and headaches. There is, however, despite the popularity of MFR in manual therapy, little consensus on whether it leads to biomechanical, systemic or interoceptive outcomes. Aims. This study aimed to explore the immediate biomechanical (increased elasticity for increased range of motion), systemic (local vs. distal areas of pain threshold) and bodily awareness effects (interoception) of a myofascial release technique on the thoracic spine. Method 12 healthy participants took part in this triple-bind, repeated measures, cross over design study, and were randomised into counterbalanced sequences of three conditions; a control, a sham and the MFR condition. The outcome measures used were; range of motion (ROM), pain pressure thresholds (PPT), and interoceptive sensitivity (IS) to assess biomechanical, systemic and interoceptive effects of MFR. Results There were significant increases in ROM and PPT (both local and distal) post MFR intervention. There was also a positive correlation between baseline interoceptive sensitivity and post-MFR ROM and a negative correlation for baseline interoceptive sensitivity and post-MRF PPT. Interoceptive sensitivity did increase post-MFR but this was non-significant. Conclusions The increase in ROM suggests that the MFR may have caused a biomechanical change in tissue elasticity creating an increase in tissue flexibility. The increase in both local and distal sites of the PPT suggest an overall systemic response to the therapy. The correlation between baseline IS and post-MFR ROM and PPT suggest that IS may be usefully applied as a predictor for ROM and PPT post-MFR.}},

Aims The study aimed to explore whether a high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust of the TLJ would increase spinal mobility (measured through Range of Motion; ROM) and change IAc. Also, whether baseline IAc correlated with the post-ROM measures and change in ROM. Method 21 asymptomatic participants were allocated into three conditions in a randomised order. These were; (1) a high velocity low amplitude manipulation of the TLJ; (2) sham (basic touch); and (3) a control (laying supine on a plinth). Before and following each intervention, the participants’ spinal ROM was measured using an Acumar digital inclinometer. In addition to this an ECG was used to measure their pre and post condition IAc. Results There were significant increases in ROM for all condition, however, the HVLA thrust led to a significantly greater increase in ROM (p < 0.001) when compared to the control and sham. Baseline IAc was inversely associated with post-ROM but there was no association with change in ROM. The HVLA thrust did not significantly change IAc scores from pre to post intervention. Conclusions. HVLA thrust over the TLJ is a useful intervention for increasing spinal ROM. IAc maybe a useful predictor for intervention effectiveness of this technique and spinal area which could in the future be utilised by osteopaths as part of their diagnostics.}},

abstract = {{Degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) in the setting of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis is commonly treated with spinal fusion in addition to decompression with laminectomy. However, recent studies have shown similar clinical outcomes after decompression alone, suggesting that a subset of DS patients may not require spinal fusion. Identification of dynamic instability could prove useful for predicting which patients are at higher risk of post-laminectomy destabilization necessitating fusion. The goal of this study was to determine if static clinical radiographs adequately characterize dynamic instability in patients with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) and to compare the rotational and translational kinematics in vivo during continuous dynamic flexion activity in DS versus asymptomatic age-matched controls. Seven patients with symptomatic single level lumbar DS (6 M, 1 F; 66 ± 5.0 years) and seven age-matched asymptomatic controls (5 M, 2 F age 63.9 ± 6.4 years) underwent biplane radiographic imaging during continuous torso flexion. A volumetric model-based tracking system was used to track each vertebra in the radiographic images using subject-specific 3D bone models from high-resolution computed tomography (CT). In vivo continuous dynamic sagittal rotation (flexion/extension) and AP translation (slip) were calculated and compared to clinical measures of intervertebral flexion/extension and AP translation obtained from standard lateral flexion/extension radiographs. Static clinical radiographs underestimate the degree of AP translation seen on dynamic in vivo imaging (1.0 vs 3.1 mm; p = 0.03). DS patients demonstrated three primary motion patterns compared to a single kinematic pattern in asymptomatic controls when analyzing continuous dynamic in vivo imaging. 3/7 (42\%) of patients with DS demonstrated aberrant mid-range motion. Continuous in vivo dynamic imaging in DS reveals a spectrum of aberrant motion with significantly greater kinematic heterogeneity than previously realized that is not readily seen on current clinical imaging.

abstract = {{The assessment of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) based on electrocardiograms (ECG) is considered a good proxy for stress in a wide range of animal species. However, problems can occur e.g., when measuring ECG in ambulatory settings such as recording of unrestrained animals using non‐invasive devices. Artefacts caused by technical (i.e. bad electrode contact) or physiological (i.e. ectopic beats, non‐cardiac muscle potentials) sources are common and can disturb the ECG signal. As HRV analysis is highly sensitive to artefacts in the interbeat interval (RR‐interval) time series the process of visual inspection of the raw signal to detect and correct these is essential. Most of the commercially available software requires intensive training and extensive manual work to accomplish this task and/or is often not available to access for free. EasieRR is an open‐source, stand‐alone software optimized for analysing ECG in non‐restrained animals. The program allows a species‐specific analysis and calculation of recommended standard HRV parameters in both, the time‐ and the nonlinear domain (RMSSD, SDNN, SD1 and SD2). Visualization of data using Poincaré plots and tachograms of RR‐intervals eases the validation of correct heart cycle interval detection and minimizes manual work for the user. Automatically detected peaks can be manually corrected via deletion, correction of spurious detections or marking of undetected peaks. The HRV analysis can be exported using common formats (TXT, MAT). Figures can be plotted and exported in various formats (PDF, SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EMF and EPS). Included in EasieRR is the possibility for synchronization of ECG data with video in order to link cardiac responses to specific behavioural responses. Die Analyse der Herzfrequenz (HF) und der Herzfrequenzvariabilität (HRV) aufgrund von Elektrokardiogrammen (EKG) kann zur Evaluation von Stress bei Tieren herangezogen werden. Fehlerhafter Hautkontakt der Messtechnik und Muskelpotentiale durch Bewegung können zu Artefakten im EKG und in Folge zu Fehlern im Tachogramm führen. Die visuelle Inspektion des EKG und eine anschließende Korrektur falsch detektierter QRS‐Komplexe ist daher unerlässlich, kann jedoch mit verfügbarer Software einen zeitaufwendigen Prozess darstellen. EasieRR ist eine benutzerfreundliche und frei‐zugängliche Software optimiert zur EKG‐Analyse am Tier. Das Programm ermöglich eine Art‐spezifische Analyse im zeitbasierten (mittlere HF, SD, RMSSD) und nicht‐linearen Bereich (SD1, SD2). Die Benutzeroberfläche von EasieRR kombiniert EKG und Tachogramm mit der Darstellung von Poincaré‐Plots und erleichtert somit das Auffinden von Artefakten, deren Korrektur und die HRV Analyse. Während der visuellen Inspektion als fehlerhaft erkannte R‐Zacken können manuell gelöscht, verschoben oder neu eingefügt werden. Die Ergebnisse der HRV‐Analyse können in gängigen Formaten (MAT, XLSX) exportiert werden und stehen für weitere statistische Anwendungen zur Verfügung. Grafiken können im Format PDF, SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EMF und EPS gesichert werden. EasieRR ermöglich auch die Synchronisation von Videoaufnahmen mit EKG‐Daten, und somit die Verknüpfung von Herzfrequenzparametern mit spezifischen Verhaltensweisen.}},

Forty-six patients with non-specific chronic LBP and 23 healthy controls were asked to perform a trunk muscles fatigue protocol. Surface electromyography was recorded using two adhesive matrix of 64 electrodes applied bilaterally over the erector spinae. Pain score, kinesiophobia and physical disability were analyzed through different questionnaires. To characterize motor variability, dispersion of muscular activity center of gravity was computed. Motor variability between groups was compared using repeated-measures analyses of variance. Score of disability and kinesiophobia were significantly higher in patients with LBP. Results indicated a significant group effect characterized by an increased motor variability in the healthy group through the entire fatigue task on the left (p = 0.003) and right side (p = 0.048). Interestingly, increasing muscle fatigue led to increased motor variability in both groups (on both sides (p < 0.001) but with a greater increase in the healthy group. Muscle recruitment is altered in patients with chronic LBP in the presence of muscle fatigue. Consequently, these patients exhibit changes in muscle recruitment pattern and intensity (lower levels of motor variability) during sustained isometric contraction that may be attributed to variation in the control of motor units within and between muscles. However, patients with LBP are able to increase their motor variability over time but with a lower increase compared to healthy participants.}},

The features of the model include the abilities to predict joint reactions, muscle forces, and muscle activation patterns. To illustrate the capabilities of the model and validate its physiological similarity, the model’s predictions for the moment arms of the muscles are shown for a range of flexion–extension motions of the lower back. The model uses the OpenSim platform and is freely available on https://www.simtk.org/home/lumbarspine to other spinal researchers interested in analyzing the kinematics of the spine.

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that sensorimotor impairments in LBP may be associated with brain changes. However, no consensus exists regarding the relationship between functional brain changes and sensorimotor behavior in LBP. Therefore, this review critically discusses the available functional magnetic resonance imaging studies on brain activation related to nonnociceptive somatosensory stimulation and motor performance in individuals with LBP. Four electronic databases were searched, yielding nine relevant studies. Patients with LBP showed reduced sensorimotor-related brain activation and a reorganized lumbar spine representation in higher-order (multi)sensory processing and motor regions, including primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, supplementary motor area, and superior temporal gyrus. These results may support behavioral findings of sensorimotor impairments in LBP. In addition, patients with LBP displayed widespread increased sensorimotor-evoked brain activation in regions often associated with abnormal pain processing. Overactivation in these regions could indicate an overresponsiveness to sensory inputs that signal potential harm to the spine, thereby inducing overgeneralized protective responses. Hence, functional brain changes could contribute to the development and recurrence of LBP. However, future studies investigating the causality between sensorimotor-related brain function and LBP are imperative.}},

Design A prospective, cross-sectional study. Setting Primary health care center in Madrid, Spain. Participants A total of 200 participants were classified into 2 groups: asymptomatic participants (n = 100) and patients with CLBP (n = 100). Methods After consenting to participate, all recruited participants received a sociodemographic questionnaire, a set of self-report measures and completed the Revised Movement Imagery Questionnaire. Main Outcomes Measurements Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability using the Revised Movement Imagery Questionnaire. A mental chronometry using a stopwatch and psychosocial variables using self-reported questionnaires. Results Our results indicated that patients with CLBP had difficulty generating kinesthetic and visual motor images and also took a longer time to imagine them. A regression analysis indicated that in the CLBP group, the predictor variable for fear of activity and coping symptom self-efficacy was visual motor imagery (explaining 16.2\% of the variance); however, the predictor variable for LBP disability and pain management self-efficacy was kinesthetic motor imagery (explaining 17.8\% of the variance). Conclusions It appears that patients with CLBP have greater difficulty generating visual and kinesthetic motor images compared with asymptomatic participants, and they also need more time to perform these mental tasks.

abstract = {{Chronic low back pain (chronic LBP) is both debilitating for patients but also a major burden on the health care system. Previous studies reported various maladaptive structural and functional changes among chronic LBP patients on spine- and supraspinal levels including behavioral alterations. However, evidence for cortical reorganization in the sensorimotor system of chronic LBP patients is scarce. Motor Imagery (MI) is suitable for investigating the cortical sensorimotor network as it serves as a proxy for motor execution. Our aim was to investigate differential MI-driven cortical processing in chronic LBP compared to healthy controls (HC) by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-nine subjects (15 chronic LBP patients, 14 HC) were included in the current study. MI stimuli consisted of randomly presented video clips showing every-day activities involving different whole-body movements as well as walking on even ground and walking downstairs and upstairs. Guided by the video clips, subjects had to perform MI of these activities, subsequently rating the vividness of their MI performance. Brain activity analysis revealed that chronic LBP patients exhibited significantly reduced activity compared to HC subjects in MI-related brain regions, namely the left supplementary motor area and right superior temporal sulcus. Furthermore, psycho-physiological-interaction analysis yielded significantly enhanced functional connectivity (FC) between various MI-associated brain regions in chronic LBP patients indicating diffuse and non-specific changes in FC. Current results demonstrate initial findings about differences in MI-driven cortical processing in chronic LBP pointing towards reorganization processes in the sensorimotor network.}},

abstract = {{Pain-related interactions between primary motor (M1) and primary sensory (S1) cortex are poorly understood. In particular, the time-course over which S1 processing and corticomotor output are altered in association with muscle pain is unclear. We aimed to examine the temporal profile of altered processing in S1 and altered corticomotor output with finer temporal resolution than has been used previously. In 10 healthy individuals we recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in separate sessions at multiple time-points before, during and immediately after pain induced by hypertonic saline infusion in a hand muscle, and at 15 and 25 minutes follow-up. Participants reported an average pain intensity that was less in the session where SEPs were recorded (SEPs: 4.0±1.6; MEPs: 4.9±2.3). In addition, the time taken for pain to return to zero once infusion of hypertonic saline ceased was less for participants in the SEP session (SEPs: 4.7±3.8 mins; MEPs 9.4±7.4 mins). Both SEPs and MEPs began to reduce almost immediately after pain reached 5/10 following hypertonic saline injection and were significantly reduced from baseline by the second (SEPs) and third (MEPs) recording blocks during pain. Both parameters remained suppressed immediately after pain had resolved and at 15 and 25 minutes after the resolution of pain. These data suggest S1 processing and corticomotor output may be co-modulated in association with muscle pain. Interestingly, this is in contrast to previous observations. This discrepancy may best be explained by an effect of the SEP test stimulus on the corticomotor pathway. This novel finding is critical to consider in experimental design and may be potentially useful to consider as an intervention for the management of pain.}},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”).

Recently we observed adaptive changes in motor cortical organisation in patients with recurrent low back pain (LBP), which are linked to altered motor coordination. Although changes in motor coordination can be trained and are associated with improved symptoms and function, it remains unclear whether these training-induced changes are related to reorganisation of the motor cortex. This was investigated using the model of a delay in postural activation of the deep abdominal muscle, transversus abdominis (TrA) in 20 individuals with recurrent LBP. Subjects were allocated to either motor skill training that involved isolated voluntary contractions of TrA, or a control intervention of self-paced walking exercise for 2 weeks. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from TrA bilaterally using intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. Motor cortical organisation using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and postural activation associated with single rapid arm movements were investigated before and after training. Motor skill training induced an anterior and medial shift in motor cortical representation of TrA, towards that observed in healthy individuals from our previous study. This shift was associated with earlier postural activation of TrA. Changes were not observed following unskilled walking exercise. This is the first observation that motor training can reverse reorganisation of neuronal networks of the motor cortex in people with recurrent pain. The observed relationship between cortical reorganisation and changes in motor coordination following motor training provides unique insight into potential mechanisms that underlie recovery.}},

In order to better understand how ISOM impacts on CLBP condition, the present study contrasted ISOM aftereffects on Ml function, MF postural activation and pain with another training, the global activation of paravertebral muscles (GLOB, hip extension). The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of ISOM and GLOB (3-week training each) on MF postural activation and Ml function in a CLBP population. Methods Twenty-four people with CLBP were randomly allocated to ISOM and GLOB groups for a 3- week daily practice. Pre/post-training after-effects were assessed by the onset of superficial MF (MF-S) activation during ballistic limb movements (bilateral shoulder flexion in standing; unilateral hip extension in prine lying), MF-S corticomotor control tested by transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1, and assessment of pain, kinesiophobia and disability by standardized questionnaires. Results Both ISOM and GLOB improved pain and disability. However, only ISOM influenced Ml function (decreased corticospinal excitability and increased intracortical inhibition), fastened MF-S postural activation and decreased kinesiophobia. Conclusions Changes of corticospinal excitability and of MF-S postural adjustments suggest that ISOM better influenced brain plasticity. Future studies should further test whether our novel findings relate to an influence of the exercises on the lumbopelvic control of different muscles and on cognitive function. Clinically, individual’s evaluation remains warranted before prescribing one or the other of these two conventional exercises for reducing pain. Implications This original study presents how motor control exercises can influence brain plasticity and postural control in chronic low back pain. This knowledge will impact on the decision of clinicians to prescribe specific exercises with a view of improving motor control in this musculoskeletal condition.}},

One strategy to attenuate M1 excitability is to influence prefrontal and premotor cortex activity. Working memory tasks, e.g. the two-back task (TBT), engage prefrontal and premotor cortices and may influence M1 excitability. We hypothesized that performing the TBT during pain would influence pain-related changes in M1 excitability. Participants (n = 28) received rigorous training in the TBT before baseline testing. Experimental pain was induced by injecting hypertonic saline into the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Participants rated pain intensity on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (NRS) every second min until pain-resolved (PR) during the performance of the TBT (n = 14) or during REST (n = 14). In the TBT, letters were presented pseudo-randomly, and accuracy and reaction time to identified letters corresponding to letters shown two times back were recorded. M1 excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded at baseline, and at PR, PR + 10, PR + 20, and PR + 30 min. Four minutes after hypertonic saline injection, the pain NRS scores were higher in the TBT group than the REST group (p = 0.009). No time × group interaction was found for MEPs (p = 0.73), but a main effect of time (p < 0.0005) revealed a reduction of MEPs at PR up until PR + 30 (p < 0.008).

Here we aimed to determine whether motor cortical reorganization in low back pain (LBP) can be identified using noninvasive surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings of back muscles at different lumbar levels, and whether cortical reorganization is related to clinical features of LBP. Summary of Background Data. Reorganization of motor regions of the brain may contribute to altered motor control, pain, and disability in chronic LBP. However, data have been limited by the need for invasive recordings of back muscle myoelectric activity. The relationship between altered cortical organization and clinical features of LBP remains unclear. Methods. In 27 individuals with recurrent, nonspecific LBP and 23 pain-free controls, we mapped the motor cortical representation of the paraspinal muscles using transcranial magnetic stimulation in conjunction with noninvasive surface EMG recordings at L3 and L5 levels. Clinical measures of pain severity, location, and duration were made. Results. The results demonstrate a loss of discrete motor cortical organization of the paraspinal muscles in chronic LBP that can be identified using noninvasive EMG recordings. A loss of discrete cortical organization was clearer when surface electrodes were positioned at L3 rather than L5. A novel finding was that altered motor cortical organization (number of discrete peaks and map volume) was associated with the severity and location of LBP. Conclusion. These data suggest that surface EMG positioned at L3 is appropriate for the identification of changes in the motor cortex in LBP. Furthermore, our data have implications for treatment strategies that aim to restore cortical organization in LBP. Level of Evidence: 2}},

This study aimed at testing whether people with right- versus left-sided CLBP showed different M1 excitability and APA. Thirty-five individuals with lateralized CLBP (19 right-sided and 16 left-sided) and 13 pain-free subjects (normative values) were tested for the excitability of MF M1 area (active motor threshold—AMT) with transcranial magnetic stimulation and for the latency of MF APA during bilateral shoulder flexion and during unilateral hip extension in prone lying. In the right-sided CLBP group, the AMT of both M1 areas was lower than in the left-sided group and the pain-free subjects; the latency of MF APA was shorter in bilateral shoulder flexion and in the left hip extension tasks as compared to the left-sided group. In CLBP, an earlier MF APA was correlated with lower AMT in both tasks. People with right-sided CLBP presented with increased M1 excitability in both hemispheres and earlier MF APA. These results likely rely on cortical motor adaptation related to the tasks and axial muscles tested. Future studies should investigate whether CLBP side-related differences have a clinical impact, e.g. in diagnosis and intervention.}},

Therefore, we tested MF corticomotor control using double transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms for the first time in this muscle and examined its link with MF volitional activation. Eleven individuals with lateralized CLBP and 13 pain-free participants were recruited. Ultrasound imaging enabled measurement of MF volitional isometric contraction in prone lying. TMS of MF M1 area was used to test hemispheric excitability and mechanisms in relation to motor programming, i.e., active motor threshold (AMT), amplitude of motor-evoked potentials and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (SICF). In CLBP, SICI level was lower in the left hemisphere and MF volitional contraction was not related to AMT (M1 excitability), conversely to what was observed in the pain-free group. No other between-group difference was detected. These original findings support a plasticity of cortical maps controlling paravertebral muscles and likely including a different motor strategy for the control of MF.

abstract = {{Many people with recurrent low back pain (LBP) have deficits in postural control of the trunk muscles and this may contribute to the recurrence of pain episodes. However, the neural changes that underlie these motor deficits remain unclear. As the motor cortex contributes to control of postural adjustments, the current study investigated the excitability and organization of the motor cortical inputs to the trunk muscles in 11 individuals with and without recurrent LBP. EMG activity of the deep abdominal muscle, transversus abdominis (TrA), was recorded bilaterally using intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. Postural control was assessed as onset of TrA EMG during single rapid arm flexion and extension tasks. Motor thresholds (MTs) for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were determined for responses contralateral and ipsilateral to the stimulated cortex. In addition, responses of TrA to TMS over the contralateral cortex were mapped during voluntary contractions at 10\% of maximum. MTs and map parameters [centre of gravity (CoG) and volume] were compared between healthy and LBP groups. The CoG of the motor cortical map of TrA in the healthy group was ∼2 cm anterior and lateral to the vertex, but was more posterior and lateral in the LBP group. The location of the CoG and the map volume were correlated with onset of TrA EMG during rapid arm movements. Furthermore, the MT needed to evoke ipsilateral responses was lower in the LBP group, but only on the less excitable hemisphere. These findings provide preliminary evidence of reorganization of trunk muscle representation at the motor cortex in individuals with recurrent LBP, and suggest this reorganization is associated with deficits in postural control.}},

Twelve healthy individuals were injected with NGF into right extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) on Days 0 and 2 and with hypertonic saline on Day 4. Quantitative sensory and motor testing and assessment of M1 organization and function using transcranial magnetic stimulation were performed prior to injection on Days 0, 2, and 4 and again on Day 14. Pain and disability increased at Day 2 and increased further at Day 4. Reorganization of M1 was evident at Day 4 and was characterized by increased map excitability. These changes were accompanied by reduced intracortical inhibition and increased intracortical facilitation. Interhemispheric inhibition was reduced from the “affected” to the “unaffected” hemisphere on Day 4, and this was associated with increased pressure sensitivity in left ECRB. These data provide the first evidence of M1 adaptation in the transition to sustained muscle pain and have relevance for the development of therapies that seek to target M1 in musculoskeletal pain.}},

However, these changes are opposite, with decreased cortical activity reported in experimentally-induced acute pain (lasting minutes to hours), and increased cortical activity in chronic, clinical pain (lasting>6 months). It is unknown whether sensorimotor cortical activity is altered in acute, clinical musculoskeletal pain (lasting<4 weeks). In 36 individuals with acute, non-specific, clinical low back pain (LBP) and 36 age- and sex-matched, pain-free controls, we investigated the processing of non-noxious afferent inputs using sensory evoked potentials (SEPs), as well as corticomotor excitability and organisation of the primary motor cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Processing of non-noxious sensory inputs was lower (smaller area of the N80-N150-P260 SEP complex) in acute LBP (F1,70=45.28, p<0.01). Examination of specific SEP components revealed smaller area of the N150 and P260 SEP components in acute LBP, although inter-individual variability was high. Motor cortical map volume was lower in acute LBP (F1,70=5.61, p=0.02). These findings demonstrate that acute LBP is characterised by lower sensorimotor cortical activity at the group level. However, individual variation was high, suggesting individual adaptation of cortical plasticity in acute pain. Perspective: This is the first study to examine sensorimotor cortical activity in the acute stage of clinical low back pain. This information is critical for understanding the neurophysiology of acute low back pain.}},

abstract = {{According to our hypothesis, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is an acute compression axonopathy of the nerve endings in the muscle spindle. It is caused by the superposition of compression when repetitive eccentric contractions are executed under cognitive demand. The acute compression axonopathy could coincide with microinjury of the surrounding tissues and is enhanced by immune-mediated inflammation. DOMS is masked by sympathetic nervous system activity at initiation, but once it subsides, a safety mode comes into play to prevent further injury. DOMS becomes manifest when the microinjured non-nociceptive sensory fibers of the muscle spindle stop inhibiting the effects of the microinjured, hyperexcited nociceptive sensory fibers, therefore providing the ‘open gate’ in the dorsal horn to hyperalgesia. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide play a cross-talking role in the parallel, interlinked degeneration–regeneration mechanisms of these injured tissues. We propose that the mitochondrial electron transport chain generated free radical involvement in the acute compression axonopathy. ‘Closed gate exercises’ could be of nonpharmacological therapeutic importance, because they reduce neuropathic pain in addition to having an anti-inflammatory effect. Finally, DOMS could have an important ontogenetical role by not just enhancing ability to escape danger to survive in the wild, but also triggering muscle growth.}},

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review to understand the effects of increased cognitive demand on movement patterns among individuals with musculoskeletal injuries. A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and SPORTDiscus was conducted to find research reports that included a population that had previously experienced an ankle, knee, or low back injury, included an uninjured control group, and assessed a dual-task paradigm. Forty-five full-text research reports were assessed, of which 28 studies (six ankle injury, nine knee injury, and 13 low back pain studies) were included in the review. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality and the study design extracted for analysis including the participants, cognitive and physical tasks performed, as well as outcome measures (e.g., three-dimensional kinematics, center of pressure, etc.). All studies included were cross-sectional or case–control with methodological quality scores of 17.8 ± 2.2 out of a possible 22. Twenty-five of the 28 studies found changes in motor performance with dual-task conditions compared with single tasks. Furthermore, 54\% of studies reported a significant group by task interaction effect, reporting at least one alteration in injured groups’ motor performance under dual-task conditions when compared with an uninjured group. The results of this systematic review indicate that motor performance is further impaired by placing a cognitive load on individuals in populations with musculoskeletal injury. More demanding tasks such as gait appear to be more affected in injured individuals than simple balance tasks. Future investigators may want to consider the difficulty of the tasks included as well as the impact of dual-task paradigms on rehabilitation programs.}},

However, it has been suggested that objective measures of low back pain patients' functional status should be used to aid clinical assessment. The aim of this study is to systematically review which kinematic /kinetic parameters have been used to assess low back pain patients against healthy controls and to propose clinical kinematic/kinetic measures. Methods PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies. Reference lists of selected studies and hand searches were performed. Studies had to compare people with and without non-specific low back pain while performing functional tasks and report body segment/joint kinematic and/or kinetic data. Two reviewers independently identified relevant papers. Findings Sixty-two studies were included. Common biases identified were lack of assessor blinding and sample size calculation, use of samples of convenience, and poor experimental protocol standardization. Studies had small sample sizes. Range of motion maneuvers were the main task performed (33/62). Kinematic/kinetic data of different individual or combination of body segments/joints were reported among the studies, commonest was to assess the hip joint and lumbar segment motion (13/62). Only one study described full body movement. The most commonly reported outcome was range of motion. Statistically significant differences between controls and low back pain groups were reported for different outcomes among the studies. Moreover, when the same outcome was reported disagreements were noted.

abstract = {{Spinal fusion became what has been termed the “gold standard” for the treatment of mechanical low back pain, yet there was no scientific basis for this. Operations of fusion for low back pain were initially done at the beginning of the last century for back pain thought to be related to congenital abnormalities or for past spinal infection. The recognition of the disc as a cause of sciatica, commonly associated with back pain, and the recognition that a degenerate disc led to abnormal movement suggested the concept that this abnormal movement was the cause of pain, and this abnormal movement came to be called “instability”. Much biomechanical expertise confirmed the fact that degenerate discs led to abnormal movement, there were many hypothesis as to why this caused pain. However clinical results of fusion for back pain were unpredictable. The failure of pedicle screws and cage fusion to improve the clinical results of fusion despite near 100\% fusion success, and the introduction of “flexible stabilization” and artificial discs, which demonstrated that despite the often unpredictable movement permitted by of these devices, clinical success was similar to fusion, directed attention to the other role of the disc, that of load transfer, which these devices also affected. Abnormal load transfer was already known to be critical in other joints in the body and had led to the use of osteotomy to realign joints. The relevance of load transfer to the future design of spinal implants used in the treatment of low back pain is discussed, and some finite element studies are reported demonstrating the likely effect of abnormal loading beneath an incompletely incorporated plate of an artificial disc, perhaps explaining in part the somewhat disappointing clinical results to date of the implantation of artificial discs.}},

One factor which might potentially contribute to ongoing pain is maladaptive variation in the level of activity in the lumbar musculature. Several studies have investigated this activity using surface electromyography, in varied muscles and during a number of functional activities. Due to differences in the applied methodology, the results have been difficult to compare, and previous reviews have been limited in scope. In this protocol, we aim to perform a comprehensive review of the effect of chronic low back pain on lumbar muscle activity. This protocol was informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and results will be reported in line with the PRISMA. Searches will be conducted on the Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ZETOC and CINAHL databases, along with a comprehensive review of grey literature and key journals. One reviewer will conduct the searches, but two independent reviewers will screen potential studies and assess the risk of bias within studies which meet the inclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa risk of bias tool, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines will be used to assess the quality of the data. Meta-analysis will be conducted where appropriate on groups of studies with homogenous methodology. Where studies are too heterogeneous to allow for meta-analysis, meta-synthesis will instead be completed, comparing results in terms of net increases or decreases of activity. This review aims to identify common adaptations of muscle activity in people with low back pain and it is expected that the results will influence future research directions and future rehabilitation approaches. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. CRD42019125156}},

We thus developed a novel 3D analyzing system for the relative motions of individual vertebrae using 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analyzed in vivo 3D intervertebral motions of the lumbar spine during trunk rotation. Ten healthy volunteers underwent 3D MRI of the lumbar spine in nine positions with 15° increments during trunk rotation (0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, and maximum). Relative motions of the lumbar spine were calculated by automatically superimposing a segmented 3D MRI of the vertebra in the neutral position over images of each position using the voxel-based registration method. These 3D motions were represented with 6 degrees of freedom by Euler angles and translations on the coordinate system. The mean axial rotation of ten healthy volunteers of each lumbar spinal segment in 45° trunk rotation to each side ranged from 1.2° to 1.7°. Coupled flexion with axial rotation was observed at the segments from L1/2 to L5/S1. Coupled lateral bending of the segments from L1/2 to L4/5 was in the opposite direction of the trunk rotation, while that of T12/L1 and L5/S1 was in the same direction. The direction of the coupled lateral bending in the present study was different from that in the previous cadaver study only at L4/5. This difference might result from the non-load state of the supine position in the current study and/or the non-physiological state in the cadaver study. Our system has two limitations: (1) the study was conducted with each volunteer in the supine position, and (2) because the rotation device regulated trunk rotation, trunk rotation might not have been physiological. In vivo 3D intervertebral motions of the lumbar spine during trunk rotation were evaluated using our novel motion analysis system. These data may be useful for the optimal orthopaedic management of lumbar spinal disorders.}},

To measure three-dimensional segmental motion in vivo using a noninvasive measurement technique. Summary of Background Data. Spinal instability has been implicated as a potential cause of low back pain, especially, axial rotational instability. Typically, flexion-extension lateral radiographs were used to quantify instability, but inaccurately measured translations and inability to capture out-of-plane rotations are limitations. Methods. Using a custom-calibrated rotation jig, L1–S1 CT reconstructions were created of volunteers in each of 3 positions: supine and left and right rotations of the torso with respect to the hips. Segmental motions were calculated using Euler angles and volume merge methods in three major planes. Results. Segmental motions were small (<4° or 6mm) with the greatest motions seen in axial rotation (range, 0.6° to 2.2°), lateral bending (range, −3.6° to 3.0°), and frontal translation (−1.2mm to 5.4mm). Largest motions were in the levels: L1–L2 to L3–L4. Conclusions. Complex coupled motions were measured due to external torsion and could be indicative of instability chronic patients with low back pain. The presented data provide baseline segmental motions for future comparisons to symptomatic subjects.}},

This study investigated the in vivo characteristic motion patterns of the human lumbar spine during a dynamic axial rotation of the body. Specifically, the contribution of each motion segment to the lumbar axial rotation and the coupled bending of the vertebrae during the dynamic axial rotation of the body were analyzed. Eight asymptomatic subjects (M/F, 7/1; age, 40–60 years) were recruited. The lumbar segment of each subject was MRI scanned for construction of 3D models of the vertebrae from L2 to S1. The lumbar spine was then imaged using a dual fluoroscopic system while the subject performed a dynamic axial rotation from maximal left to maximal right in a standing position. The 3D vertebral models and the fluoroscopic images were used to reproduce the in vivo vertebral motion. In this study, we analyzed the primary left–right axial rotation, the coupled left–right bending of each vertebral segment from L2 to S1 levels. The primary axial rotations of all segments (L2–S1) followed the direction of the body axial rotation. Contributions of each to the overall segment axial rotation were 6.7° ± 3.0° (27.9 \%) for the L2–L3, 4.4° ± 1.2° (18.5 \%) for the L3–L4, 6.4° ± 2.2° (26.7 \%) for the L4–L5, and 6.4° ± 2.6° (27.0 \%) for the L5–S1 vertebral motion segments. The upper segments of L2–L3 and L3–L4 demonstrated a coupled contralateral bending towards the opposite direction of the axial rotation, while the lower segments of L4–L5 and L5–S1 demonstrated a coupled ipsilateral bending motion towards the same direction of the axial rotation. Strong correlation between the primary axial rotation and the coupled bending was found at each vertebral level. We did not observe patterns of coupled flexion/extension rotation with the primary axial rotation. This study demonstrated that a dynamic lumbar axial rotation coupling with lateral bendings is segment–dependent and can create a coordinated dynamic coupling to maintain the global dynamic balance of the body. The results could improve our understanding of the normal physiologic lumbar axial rotation and to establish guidelines for diagnosing pathological lumbar motion.}},

However, the in vivo weightbearing dynamic motion characteristics of the L4–5 and L5–S1 motion segments are still not clearly described in literature. This study investigated in vivo motion of the lumbar spine during a weight-lifting activity. Ten asymptomatic subjects (M/F: 5/5; age: 40–60 years) were recruited. The lumbar segment of each subject was MRI-scanned to construct 3D models of the L2–S1 vertebrae. The lumbar spine was then imaged using a dual fluoroscopic imaging system as the subject performed a weight-lifting activity from a lumbar flexion position (45°) to maximal extension position. The 3D vertebral models and the fluoroscopic images were used to reproduce the in vivo vertebral positions along the motion path. The relative translations and rotations of each motion segment were analyzed. All vertebral motion segments, L2–3, L3–4, L4–5 and L5–S1, rotated similarly during the lifting motion. L4–5 showed the largest anterior-posterior (AP) translation with 2.9 ± 1.5 mm and was significantly larger than L5–S1 (p < 0.05). L5–S1 showed the largest proximal–distal (PD) translation with 2.8 ± 0.9 mm and was significantly larger than all other motion segments (p < 0.05).

The data provide insight into the physiological motion characteristics of the lumbar spine and potential mechanical mechanisms of lumbar disease development.}},

abstract = {{Availability of accurate three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of lumbar vertebrae is necessary to understand normal and pathological biomechanics of the lumbar spine. Due to the technical challenges of imaging the lumbar spine motion in vivo, it has been difficult to obtain comprehensive, 3D lumbar kinematics during dynamic functional tasks. The present study demonstrates a recently developed technique to acquire true 3D lumbar vertebral kinematics, in vivo, during a functional load-lifting task. The technique uses a high-speed dynamic stereo-radiography (DSX) system coupled with a volumetric model-based bone tracking procedure. Eight asymptomatic male participants performed weight-lifting tasks, while dynamic X-ray images of their lumbar spines were acquired at 30 fps. A custom-designed radiation attenuator reduced the radiation white-out effect and enhanced the image quality. High resolution CT scans of participants' lumbar spines were obtained to create 3D bone models, which were used to track the X-ray images via a volumetric bone tracking procedure. Continuous 3D intervertebral kinematics from the second lumbar vertebra (L2) to the sacrum (S1) were derived. Results revealed motions occurring simultaneously in all the segments. Differences in contributions to overall lumbar motion from individual segments, particularly L2–L3, L3–L4, and L4–L5, were not statistically significant. However, a reduced contribution from the L5–S1 segment was observed. Segmental extension was nominally linear in the middle range (20\%–80\%) of motion during the lifting task, but exhibited nonlinear behavior at the beginning and end of the motion. L5–S1 extension exhibited the greatest nonlinearity and variability across participants. Substantial AP translations occurred in all segments (5.0 ± 0.3 mm) and exhibited more scatter and deviation from a nominally linear path compared to segmental extension. Maximum out-of-plane rotations (<1.91 deg) and translations (<0.94 mm) were small compared to the dominant motion in the sagittal plane. The demonstrated success in capturing continuous 3D in vivo lumbar intervertebral kinematics during functional tasks affords the possibility to create a baseline data set for evaluating the lumbar spinal function. The technique can be used to address the gaps in knowledge of lumbar kinematics, to improve the accuracy of the kinematic input into biomechanical models, and to support development of new disk replacement designs more closely replicating the natural lumbar biomechanics.}},

Eleven healthy participants lifted loads of three different magnitudes (4.5, 9, and 13.5kg) from a trunk-flexed (\textbackslashtextasciitilde75°) to an upright position, while being imaged by a dynamic stereo X-ray (DSX) system. Tracked lumbar vertebral (L2-S1) motion data were processed into highly accurate 6DOF intervertebral (L2L3, L3L4, L4L5, L5S1) kinematics. ICRs were computed using the finite helical axis method. Effects of segment level and load magnitude on the anterior-posterior (AP) and superior-inferior (SI) ICR migration ranges were assessed with a mixed-effects model. Further, ICRs were averaged to a single center of rotation (COR) to assess segment-specific differences in COR AP- and SI-coordinates. The AP range was found to be significantly larger for L2L3 compared to L3L4 (p=0.02), L4L5 and L5S1 (p<0.001). Average ICR SI location was relatively higher – near the superior endplate of the inferior vertebra – for L4L5 and L5SI compared to L2L3 and L3L4 (p≤0.001) – located between the mid-transverse plane and superior endplate of the inferior vertebra – but differences were not significant amongst themselves (p>0.9). Load magnitude had a significant effect only on the SI component of ICR migration range (13.5kg>9kg and 4.5kg; p=0.049 and 0.017 respectively). The reported segment-specific ICR data exemplify improved input parameters for lumbar spine biomechanical models and design of disc replacements, and base-line references for potential diagnostic applications.}},

abstract = {{ The pathogenesis of lumbar adjacent segment disease is thought to be secondary to altered biomechanics resulting from fusion. Direct in vivo evidence for altered biomechanics following lumbar fusion is lacking. This study’s aim was to describe in vivo kinematics of the superior adjacent segment relative to the fused segment before and after lumbar fusion. This study analyzed seven patients with symptomatic lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (5 M, 2 F; age 65±5.1 years) using a biplane radiographic imaging system. Each subject performed two to three trials of continuous flexion of their torso according to established protocols. Synchronized biplane radiographs were acquired at 20 images per second one month before and six months after single-level fusion at L4-L5 or L5-S1, or two-level fusion at L3-L5 or L4-S1. A previously validated volumetric model-based tracking process was used to track the position and orientation of vertebrae in the radiographic images. Intervertebral flexion/extension and AP translation (slip) at the superior adjacent segment were calculated over the entire dynamic flexion activity. Skin-mounted surface markers were tracked using conventional motion analysis and used to determine torso flexion. Change in adjacent segment kinematics after fusion was determined at corresponding angles of dynamic torso flexion. Changes in adjacent segment motion varied across patients, however, all patients maintained or increased the amount of adjacent segment slip or intervertebral flexion/extension. No patients demonstrated both decreased adjacent segment slip and decreased rotation. This study suggests that short-term changes in kinematics at the superior adjacent segment after lumbar fusion appear to be patient-specific.}},

abstract = {{The study design is a prospective, case–control. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable measurement technique for the assessment of lumbar spine kinematics using digital video fluoroscopy in a group of patients with low back pain (LBP) and a control group. Lumbar segmental instability (LSI) is one subgroup of nonspecific LBP the diagnosis of which has not been clarified. The diagnosis of LSI has traditionally relied on the use of lateral functional (flexion–extension) radiographs but use of this method has proven unsatisfactory. Fifteen patients with chronic low back pain suspected to have LSI and 15 matched healthy subjects were recruited. Pulsed digital videofluoroscopy was used to investigate kinematics of lumbar motion segments during flexion and extension movements in vivo. Intersegmental linear translation and angular displacement, and pathway of instantaneous center of rotation (PICR) were calculated for each lumbar motion segment. Movement pattern of lumbar spine between two groups and during the full sagittal plane range of motion were analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measures design. Intersegmental linear translation was significantly higher in patients during both flexion and extension movements at L5–S1 segment (p < 0.05). Arc length of PICR was significantly higher in patients for L1–L2 and L5–S1 motion segments during extension movement (p < 0.05). This study determined some kinematic differences between two groups during the full range of lumbar spine. Devices, such as digital videofluoroscopy can assist in identifying better criteria for diagnosis of LSI in otherwise nonspecific low back pain patients in hope of providing more specific treatment.}},

A data search for articles indexed on MEDLINE until April 2002 was performed.ResultsKinematic measurements of lumbar function were categorized into 3 areas where low back patients may differ from normals: (1) end range of motion during simple movements; (2) higher order kinematics (displacement, velocity, and acceleration) during complex movement tasks; and (3) spinal proprioception. The assessment of higher order kinematics during complex movement tasks is the most highly researched and the most successful in describing differences between the populations. The use of simple end range of motion appears questionable, while assessing spinal proprioception is the least researched, yet shows potential in highlighting differences between low back sufferers and asymptomatics.ConclusionCurrent kinematic biomechanical assessment techniques are capable of identifying functional differences between low back pain populations and controls. The use and validity of the majority of these techniques as outcome measures are currently unknown, yet may be valuable in generating functional diagnoses, evaluating the mechanisms of current therapies, and prescribing specific rehabilitation programs.}},

abstract = {{Segmental apportionment of lumbar (L2–S1) rotation is a critical input parameter for musculoskeletal models and a candidate metric for clinical assessment of spinal health, but such data are sparse. This paper aims to quantify the time-variant and load-dependent characteristics of intervertebral contributions to L2–S1 extension during a dynamic lifting task. Eleven healthy participants lifted multiple weights (4.5, 9.1, and 13.6kg) from a trunk-flexed to an upright position while being imaged by a dynamic stereo X-ray system at 30frames/s. Vertebral (L2–S1) motion was tracked using a previously validated volumetric model-based tracking method that employs 3D bone models reconstructed from subject-specific CT images to obtain high-accuracy (≤0.26°, 0.2mm) 3D vertebral kinematics. Individual intervertebral motions as percentages of the total L2–S1 extension were computed at each \% increment of the motion to show the segmental apportionment. Results showed L3–L4 (25.8±2.2\%) and L4–L5 (31±3.1\%) together contributed a larger share (∼60\% combined) compared to L2–L3 (21.7±3.7\%) and L5–S1 (22.6±4.7\%); L4–L5 consistently provided the largest contribution of the measured segments. Relative changes over time in L3–L4 (6±12.5\%) and L4–L5 (0.5±10.2\%) contribution were minimal; in contrast, L2–L3 (18±20.1\%) contribution increased while L5–S1 (−33±22.9\%) contribution decreased in a somewhat complementary fashion as motion progressed. No significant effect of the magnitude of load lifted on individual segmental contribution patterns was detected. The current study updated the knowledge regarding apportionment of lumbar (L2–S1) motion among individual segments, serving both as input into musculoskeletal models and as potential biomechanical markers of low back disorders.}},

The sheer volume and complexity of now available information can be overwhelming. We aimed to distil it into a form that facilitates comparison among diverse studies addressing spinal kinematics under healthy and degenerative conditions. We specifically aimed to define a baseline definition of the spectrum of normal spinal kinematics that in turn allows a comparable definition of kinematics of the degenerative lumbar spine. The considered data was obtained by a systematic MEDLINE search including studies on angular/translational segmental motion contribution, range of motion, coupling and center of rotation. As for degenerative conditions, we collected publications on disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, facet joint tropism, spondylolisthesis, ligament degeneration and paraspinal muscle degeneration. While we could demonstrate repeating motion patterns for some topics, agreement in other fields is limited due to methodological variances and small sample sizes, particularly in publications with highly accurate but complex techniques. Besides, the high frequency of concurrent degenerative processes complicates the association between diseases and subsequent kinematical changes. Despite several substantial gaps, we stand at the precipice of technological breakthroughs that can power future large-scale studies.}},
